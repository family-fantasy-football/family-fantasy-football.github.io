Samuel is currently mired in a four-game slump that has resulted in 22 or fewer receiving yards in each contest during that span. This Thursday's crucial matchup against the Rams -- who just gave up 42 points in a win over the Bills -- is a prime opportunity for Samuel to look like his former self.

Rather than sending the game to overtime with an extra point though, coach Shane Steichen put the ball in Richardson's hands, and the young QB ran in a two-point conversion for the win.

The veteran signal-caller would go on to struggle some during the rest of the first half, although he did get Detroit back in the end zone before halftime with a two-yard scoring toss to Jahmyr Gibbs. Goff would throw his one interception on a slant during Detroit's first drive of the second half, a pick that led to a Packers touchdown. Nevertheless, he would redeem himself with three- and one-yard scoring tosses to Tim Patrick, while recording a pair of clutch completions during the game-winning drive late in the fourth quarter. Goff's interception broke a three-game streak without a pick, but he still boasts a 9:1 TD:INT over his last four contests heading into a Week 15 home showdown against Josh Allen and the Bills on Sunday, Dec. 15."

The rookie third-round pick is averaging a healthy 4.6 yards per carry over his 58 totes on the season and has also made the most of his opportunities in the passing game, recording a 6-59-0 receiving line on six targets through 12 appearances. Though Benson played just 10 of the Cardinals' 71 snaps on offense in the loss, that was still enough to match or surpass Demercado's snap count (eight) for the third time in the last four games."

Johnson's touchdown was his third receiving touchdown on the season, bringing him to four total scores through 13 games. Most of the 27-year-old's yardage total Sunday came from his touchdown, which was a 41-yard pass from Josh Allen in the second quarter.

Allen's usage combined with a negative game script left little opportunity for Cook, who saw his fewest rushing attempts of the season. More concerning was his lack of involvement as a receiver despite Allen taking to the air 37 times. Cook has now failed to reach 50 rushing yards in four of his last seven games."

Herbert left Sunday's loss to the Chiefs in the second quarter but then returned in short order and led the Chargers offense to 17 points after halftime.

Alvin Kamara led the Saints' backfield with 22 touches, but Miller's 10 topped the five that Jamaal Williams handled, and the second-year back appears to be taking advantage of the clean slate he received when Dennis Allen was let go as head coach.

He's also seen just a combined 15 touches over the last two games after averaging 19.4 carries and 2.1 catches from Weeks 4-12, a massive downgrade in his workload.

Miami ultimately came back to tie the game in the final seconds of regulation and won it in overtime without giving the Jets a chance to possess the ball, but Adams still managed to post his highest yardage total as a member of the Jets.
