</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="kyler-murray-qb">Kyler Murray (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Murray left the contest briefly to be examined for a potential head injury after a late hit in the second half of Sunday’s lopsided win. Backup Clayton Tune replaced Arizona’s starter for the remainder of the drive before Murray retook the reins on the ensuing drive. While the dual-threat QB didn’t throw any touchdowns for fantasy mangers Sunday, his only potential interception was erased by a roughing the passer penalty on the play during which he was injured. Murray escaped the win in good health, putting the signal-caller on track to start next Sunday’s tilt against Carolina.</p> <h4 id="kirk-cousins-qb">Kirk Cousins (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Cousins’ numbers were hardly of the redemptive variety after a four-game stretch that may have had his starting job in danger, but the veteran signal-caller at least snapped his four-game touchdown drought with a 30-yard first-quarter scoring strike to Drake London. Cousins ultimately wasn’t tasked with doing much more against an inept Raiders offense helmed by Desmond Ridder, leading to his lowest passing yardage total of the campaign. Cousins may enjoy a similar game script in a Week 16 home matchup against the lowly Giants, who also should pose very little threat.</p> <h4 id="zay-flowers-wr">Zay Flowers (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Flowers finished with team-high catch and target totals in the lopsided win, but he was only third in receiving yards behind Rashod Bateman and Justice Hill. The second-year wideout has eclipsed 50 receiving yards in three straight games for the first time this season heading into a Week 16 home matchup against the Steelers on Saturday afternoon.</p> <h4 id="curtis-samuel-wr">Curtis Samuel (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Prior to that, Samuel caught his only target for one yard. In his absence, Amari Cooper, Khalil Shakir, Keon Coleman and Mack Hollins are available to handle Buffalo’s wideout duties versus Detroit.</p> <h4 id="nick-chubb-rb">Nick Chubb (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Out <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Stefanski indicated that Chubb is done for the year but that he’s facing a “shorter-term recovery time” than he did last offseason, while rehabbing from a severe knee injury, Camryn Justice of News 5 Cleveland reports. Nonetheless, this marks the second year in a row in which Chubb has had his season end early due to injury, and he’ll begin his offseason focused on rehabbing. The soon-to-be 29-year-old is slated to become an unrestricted free agent at the start of the new league year in March, making his future with Cleveland uncertain. For the remainder of the 2024 campaign, beginning Sunday at Cincinnati, Jerome Ford looks positioned to operate as the No. 1 running back for the Browns, with D’Onta Foreman and Pierre Strong also available as depth options.</p> <h4 id="david-montgomery-rb">David Montgomery (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Out <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Montgomery appeared to sustain the injury on a three-yard run midway through the second quarter of Sunday’s 48-42 loss to the Bills. The Lions never ruled him out for the game, but he played limited snaps thereafter, finishing the game with season-low 35 total yards on nine touches (five carries, four receptions). The loss of Montgomery for the rest of the regular season and playoffs likely sets up Jahmyr Gibbs to take on a workhorse role out of the backfield. Behind Gibbs on the depth chart are special-teams ace Craig Reynolds and rookie Sione Vaki, both of whom could carve out larger secondary roles out of the backfield after logging just 12 and seven touches, respectively, though Detroit’s first 14 games. Montgomery wraps up his second season in Detroit with 185 carries for 775 yards (4.2 YPC) and 12 touchdowns to go with 36 catches for 341 yards on 38 targets. He’ll likely be placed on injured reserve in the coming days.</p> <h4 id="christian-watson-wr">Christian Watson (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Watson used his downfield playmaking ability to generate multiple chunk gains for the Packers, securing a 36-yard reception in the second quarter and drawing a 39-yard pass interference penalty in the third. He led Green Bay in receiving yards and tied Jayden Reed for the team lead in targets, though Romeo Doubs stole the show with two touchdown catches in the latter’s return from a concussion. Watson usually sees a few deep passes thrown his way per game and will look to make the most of those opportunities in Week 16 against the Saints.</p> <h4 id="adonai-mitchell-wr">Adonai Mitchell (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> It was a disappointing performance from the rookie, who moved into a larger role with Josh Downs out due to a shoulder injury. Mitchell started opposite Michael Pittman in a two-receiver set to begin the game and played 35 of the offense’s 62 snaps while running 16 routes. Mitchell could get a chance to bounce back after Indy’s bye in Week 14, as it’s not immediately clear if Downs will be ready to return.</p> <h4 id="travis-etienne-jr-rb">Travis Etienne Jr. (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Etienne reclaimed the lead role from Tank Bigsby, finishing with an 18-11 edge in touches after being out-touched, 19-8, by Bigsby against the Titans in Week 14. The week-to-week fluctuations limit both running backs’ upside heading into an otherwise favorable Week 16 matchup against the Raiders. Etienne’s 85 scrimmage yards against the Jets tied the season high he set back in Week 3 against the Bills.</p> <h4 id="xavier-worthy-wr">Xavier Worthy (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Chiefs made a concerted effort to get the ball into Worthy’s hands throughout the afternoon, with the rookie finishing with team-high totals in receptions, receiving yards and targets while also checking in third in rushing yards. Worthy also posted his third rushing touchdown of his career on a 21-yard run early in the second half, and his catch total was a new career high. Worthy has flashed a solid floor of late, as he’ll head into a Week 16 home matchup against the Texans on Saturday afternoon with at least four receptions and 46 receiving yards in five consecutive contests.</p> <h4 id="travis-kelce-te">Travis Kelce (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The star tight end had a quiet afternoon by his standards, but it came on an afternoon when Patrick Mahomes averaged just 4.2 yards per attempt overall. Kelce finished third on the team in receptions and receiving yards while also checking in second in targets, and he’ll head into a Week 16 home matchup against the Texans on Saturday afternoon with at least Sunday’s catch total in four consecutive contests.</p> <h4 id="alexander-mattison-rb">Alexander Mattison (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Mattison returned from an ankle injury of his own Monday before being thrust into a prominent role once Las Vegas’ starting running back was ruled out at halftime. The veteran tailback played poorly on his nine touches, losing a fumble and getting tackled for a safety. Fellow backup Ameer Abdullah produced 66 yards and a score on 10 combined touches (primarily as a receiving option) for comparison. If McCormick is forced to miss time, Mattison figures to be the next man up given his experience and success as a starter in the past, with Abdullah likely being mixed in sporadically against the Jaguars on Sunday.</p> <h4 id="gus-edwards-rb">Gus Edwards (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Edwards couldn’t get anything going on the ground, resulting in a mediocre 2.9 yards per carry. The power back isn’t tailored for an offense trying to come back from a large deficit like the Chargers were Sunday. The 29-year-old has struggled in three starts since taking over for J.K. Dobbins (knee), averaging a meager 30.3 yards per game over that span. Edwards needs to show some life against the Broncos on Thursday or he may begin losing snaps to rookie Kimani Vidal.</p> <h4 id="jalin-hyatt-wr">Jalin Hyatt (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Hyatt’s 20 offensive snaps were fourth most among Giants wideouts, well behind Malik Nabers (64), Wan’Dale Robinson (52) and Darius Slayton (46). Hyatt wasn’t able to draw a target while he was on the field, marking the third time over his past five games that he hasn’t had a ball thrown his way. Given his paltry production this season and low standing on the depth chart, as well as the overall struggles of New York’s passing game, Hyatt is off the fantasy radar in virtually all formats.</p> <h4 id="garrett-wilson-wr">Garrett Wilson (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Wilson had a 19-yard catch followed by a 22-yard touchdown reception on consecutive plays on the Jets’ first drive. His next catch didn’t come until less than 10 minutes remained in the fourth quarter, but Wilson set up a third-quarter field goal in between by drawing a 30-yard pass-interference penalty. Wilson took a back seat to Davante Adams, who had nine catches for 198 yards and two touchdowns, all in the second half. With Aaron Rodgers enjoying a resurgence down the stretch, at least statistically, Wilson and Adams have coexisted effectively, so both wide receivers will be high-end fantasy options in Week 16 against the Rams.</p> <h4 id="devonta-smith-wr">DeVonta Smith (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Smith led the Eagles’ strong showing through the air, pacing the team in targets and receptions. He tallied long gains of 22 and 20 yards to surpass 100 yards for the first time on the campaign. Smith also hauled in a two-yard touchdown pass early in the second quarter, his second score in as many games since returning from a hamstring injury. His opportunities are often relatively limited – this marked the first time he’s topped seven targets since Week 3 – which has caused inconsistent production, though Smith showcased his fantasy potential with this performance.</p> <h4 id="tony-pollard-rb">Tony Pollard (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Pollard got off to a strong start, as he accounted for 22 yards and a touchdown on the Titans’ opening possession. Things got rocky from there, however. In addition to briefly leaving the game due to ankle injury, Pollard also lost a fumble that should have been returned for a touchdown before Jordan Battle fumbled out of the end zone. Positively, Pollard remains the clear lead back and has shown the ability to excel on the ground despite the poor state of the Tennessee offense.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-height="630" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_15_2024_ARV_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-height="630" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_15_2024_ARV_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2024-25,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week15"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Hamlin My Business Week 15 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/blog/2024/Week-15-HMB/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hamlin My Business Week 15 Report"/><published>2024-12-17T14:21:22+00:00</published><updated>2024-12-17T14:21:22+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/blog/2024/Week-15-HMB</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/blog/2024/Week-15-HMB/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Hamlin My Business Lost against Who Killed Charbonnet Ramsey? 244.38-277.34<br/> Current Standing: #2<br/> Playoff Chances: 100.0%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 87.7%<br/> Best Performer: Malik Nabers (19.20 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="dandre-swift-rb">D’Andre Swift (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Swift created a conundrum for fantasy managers when he was deemed questionable with a groin injury for one of the last two games of Week 15. The 25-year-old performed well on 20 touches given the negative game script, and the 19 carries ranked second for the tailback in 14 starts this season. Swift did fail to punch in a short touchdown early in the second half, forcing the Bears to settle for a field goal in the eventual loss. Now that he’s healthy, the Georgia product will prepare to face the team (the Lions) that drafted him in 2020 on Sunday.</p> <h4 id="joe-burrow-qb">Joe Burrow (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Burrow’s second pass of the game was picked off, but he bounced back with a six-yard touchdown pass to Chase Brown on Cincinnati’s second drive. The star quarterback turned it over again on the following possession by losing a red-zone fumble before responding with another game-tying touchdown pass, this time to defensive end Sam Hubbard from two yards out. Burrow finally gave the Bengals their first lead with his third touchdown pass of the first half, finding Tee Higgins for a 38-yard score. Cincinnati ran only six offensive plays in the third quarter, the last of which was Burrow’s second interception and third turnover of the afternoon. The Bengals forced six turnovers themselves, so the offense continued to throttle down in the fourth, which kept Burrow 29 yards short of a fifth consecutive 300-yard performance. Burrow will look to add to his league-leading 36 touchdown passes in Week 16 against a Browns defense that held him to 181 passing yards back in Week 7.</p> <h4 id="devaughn-vele-wr">Devaughn Vele (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Vele’s Week 13 performance was a major disappointment considering rookie quarterback Bo Nix threw for 294 yards against the Browns. Operating as the No. 2 wideout, Vele played 31 of the Broncos’ 66 offensive snaps Monday, second only to Courtland Sutton’s 62. The rookie will look to bounce back against the Colts on Dec. 15 when the Broncos return from their Week 14 bye.</p> <h4 id="jameson-williams-wr">Jameson Williams (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Williams was limited to his lowest reception total since Week 10, but he did salvage his day with a three-yard touchdown catch with less than a minute left in the game. The wide receiver has now compiled 25 catches for 386 yards and two touchdowns over the last six games following his two-game suspension. Williams has emerged as a legitimate No. 2 option at wide receiver behind Amon-Ra St. Brown this season, catching 42 of 68 targets for 747 yards and five touchdowns while adding eight carries for 56 yards over 12 games.</p> <h4 id="joe-mixon-rb">Joe Mixon (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The injury occurred during the second quarter, but Mixon was able to finish the game, although his 32 snaps were the fewest since he returned from an earlier ankle injury Week 6. The Texans feel Miami’s Jordyn Brooks should have been flagged for an illegal hip-drop tackle, which is similar to the one that resulted in Mixon getting injured in Week 2 against the Bears. Officials did not flag the defender for a penalty on either play; however, Chicago’s T.J. Edwards was fined for the tackle under a new NFL rule outlawing a tackling technique that has caused a high frequency of injuries. Mixon’s status should be monitored during the preparation week leading into Saturday’s game at Kansas City.</p> <h4 id="ameer-abdullah-rb">Ameer Abdullah (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Starter Sincere McCormick (ankle) was injured in the second quarter before being ruled out at halftime, opening extra playing time for the Raiders’ backup RBs. Abdullah took full advantage of the opportunity and cashed in a late touchdown reception while Alexander Mattison (7-24-0) handled the early-down work in the second half. Despite the disparity in production Monday, Mattison figures to handle starting duties should McCormick be ruled out for a Week 16 tilt against the Jaguars. Abdullah would likely get worked in as a receiving option like we saw against the Falcons in the aforementioned scenario.</p> <h4 id="ladd-mcconkey-wr">Ladd McConkey (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> McConkey was iffy leading up to Sunday’s kickoff after missing last week’s contest due to injury. Hopefully fantasy managers were able to activate the shifty receiver for Week 15 after he led the Chargers in receiving yards while cashing in one of Justin Herbert’s two passing touchdowns in the blowout loss. Don’t be surprised if the rookie wideout is limited on a short practice week despite completing Sunday’s tilt without issue after logging only limited practices leading up to the contest against Tampa Bay. Assuming he suits up in Week 16, McConkey makes for a fine fantasy play against the Broncos on Thursday Night Football.</p> <h4 id="demarcus-robinson-wr">Demarcus Robinson (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> It was a miserable night for the Rams’ pass catchers outside of Puka Nacua (7-97-0), as the rest of the team combined for just nine catches for 63 yards. Robinson’s second straight goose egg for fantasy managers can be partially attributed to the rainy weather in San Francisco, but the shoulder injury that limited him to just a single practice prior to Thursday’s contest didn’t hinder his playing time; he was second on the team behind Cooper Kupp with 51 offensive snaps. Things don’t get any easier for Robinson next week, as a formidable Jets pass defense is up next in Week 16.</p> <h4 id="matthew-stafford-qb">Matthew Stafford (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Stafford didn’t look anywhere near as sharp as he had just four days earlier in a track meet against Josh Allen and the Bills, but wet conditions throughout the night certainly played a role. However, the veteran persevered through less-than-ideal circumstances and continued to display a prolific connection with Puka Nacua, with whom he connected on seven occasions for 97 yards. The biggest offensive play of the night also transpired between the two, as Stafford hit the standout receiver for a 51-yard completion to open a late fourth-quarter drive that culminated in a field goal. The veteran signal-caller did see a four-game streak of multiple touchdown passes come to an end, but he has the Rams in solid shape at 8-6 heading into a Week 16 road battle against the Jets on Sunday, Dec. 22.</p> <h4 id="tyreek-hill-wr">Tyreek Hill (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Hill was unable to take advantage of the fact Jaylen Waddle exited the game with a knee injury in the first half and didn’t return, finishing with his lowest catch and yardage totals since Week 7 and 10, respectively. Hill’s target total was also his sparsest since the latter contest, and he saw a two-game touchdown streak come to an end. The veteran speedster also was the intended target down the right sideline on Tua Tagovailoa’s game-sealing interception, a fitting ending to a disappointing afternoon. Hill’s first opportunity to bounce back comes in a Week 16 home matchup against the 49ers.</p> <h4 id="aaron-jones-rb">Aaron Jones (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Jones fell short of his third 100-yard effort of 2024 and reaching the 1,000-yard mark on the season, but the veteran back still turned in a solid performance that included his fifth rushing touchdown of the campaign on a one-yard run late in the third quarter. The 30-year-old also extended his streak of games with multiple receptions to four, and his rushing yardage total was his second highest since Week 10. Jones appears to be refreshed down the stretch run as Minnesota continues to push for the No. 1 seed in the NFC, and he’ll look to capitalize on a favorable matchup against the Seahawks’ run defense in a Week 16 road clash.</p> <h4 id="hunter-henry-te">Hunter Henry (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Henry finished first on the Patriots in receptions and second in targets Sunday, but he ranked fourth in receiving yards in a collective poor offensive showing by New England. The veteran tight end did set a new career high in receptions (64), and he is just 17 yards shy of his current best of 653 receiving yards set back in 2019. Henry’s lack of touchdowns (one) holds him back from being a reliable option in fantasy ahead of next Sunday’s tilt against Buffalo.</p> <h4 id="marquez-valdes-scantling-wr">Marquez Valdes-Scantling (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Valdes-Scantling briefly exited to get checked for a concussion during the fourth quarter, but he returned for the final drive of the game. The veteran wideout did not record a catch on three targets while quarterback Jake Haener was under center during the first half. He then wound up catching two long passes from rookie Spencer Rattler, who took over coming out of halftime. After totaling four touchdowns in his first three games with the Saints, Valdes-Scantling has gone two games in a row without a score. But, he’s logged seven targets in each of these contests, and he’s averaged 16.5 yards per catch on 21 targets across five games with New Orleans. The Saints will next play versus Green Bay on Monday, Dec. 23.</p> <h4 id="malik-nabers-wr">Malik Nabers (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Nabers led the Giants across the board in receiving categories while posting his third double-digit reception total of his career. The rookie sensation’s numbers are all the more admirable considering the team’s abysmal quarterback situation, which took another turn for the worse Sunday when Tim Boyle had to replace Tommy DeVito (concussion). Nabers could be working with any of Boyle, DeVito or Drew Lock (heel/elbow) in a Week 16 road matchup against the Falcons.</p> <h4 id="najee-harris-rb">Najee Harris (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> There was limited volume for all skill-position players in the Pittsburgh offense, as the team ran only 41 total offensive plays. Even taking that into account, Harris had a miserable showing as he averaged just 2.3 yards per attempt while also losing a pitch late in the third quarter with the Steelers threatening to score. While Russell Wilson was technically charged with the fumble, Harris did not get a touch for the rest of the game. It’s unlikely that usage carries over into a pivotal Week 16 matchup against Baltimore, though Harris has topped 65 rushing yards only once in his last six contests, making him an unreliable fantasy option even with a regular amount of touches.</p> <h4 id="george-kittle-te">George Kittle (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Kittle co-led the 49ers in receptions while comfortably setting the pace in receiving yards. While the talented tight end’s performance was nowhere near the caliber of the season-best 151-yard effort he put up against the Bears in Week 14, he’s now eclipsed 60 receiving yards in five of the last seven contests heading into a Week 16 road matchup against the Dolphins on Sunday, Dec. 22.</p> <h4 id="brock-purdy-qb">Brock Purdy (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Purdy was able to engineer a short 39-yard drive on the 49ers’ second possession that culminated in a field goal, but San Francisco punted the other six times it had the ball in the first half. After another modest 34-yard march that led to three more points to open the second half, Purdy scuffled throughout most of the rest of the contest and also threw an interception on a deep shot to Jauan Jennings with just over five minutes remaining in the game. The Rams would subsequently embark on a marathon 13-play drive that left Purdy with just 11 seconds to try and get the 50 yards necessary for a potential game-winning score, but he threw incomplete and took a sack on the final two plays. Purdy now has thrown for 159 yards or fewer in three of his past four games heading into a Week 16 road trip to face the Dolphins on Sunday, Dec. 22.</p> <h4 id="nick-westbrook-ikhine-wr">Nick Westbrook-Ikhine (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Westbrook-Ikhine remained relatively uninvolved in the Tennessee offense for the second straight week, and he now has only five targets combined across his last two games. He’s still maintained a near full-time snap rate, so a bounceback is possible. However, Westbrook-Ikhine is also likely to be held back by quarterback play, regardless of whether Mason Rudolph or Will Levis is under center.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-height="630" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_15_2024_HMB_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-height="630" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_15_2024_HMB_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2024-25,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week15"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Mama Daughter Duo Week 15 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/blog/2024/Week-15-JST/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mama Daughter Duo Week 15 Report"/><published>2024-12-17T14:21:22+00:00</published><updated>2024-12-17T14:21:22+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/blog/2024/Week-15-JST</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/blog/2024/Week-15-JST/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Mama Daughter Duo Won against Abbey Road to Victory 216.34-190.66<br/> Current Standing: #7<br/> Playoff Chances: 0.0%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 82.9%<br/> Best Performer: Anthony Richardson (13.88 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="chuba-hubbard-rb">Chuba Hubbard (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Hubbard led the backfield as expected with Jonathon Brooks (knee) sidelined. However, he couldn’t get things going, in large part because Carolina ran only 50 offensive plays. That led to his lowest yardage output on the ground since Week 1. Positively, Hubbard did remain involved as a pass catcher, as this marked his third game with at least four catches in his last five matchups.</p> <h4 id="keenan-allen-wr">Keenan Allen (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Allen bounced back from last week’s dud against the 49ers (3-30-0) with a performance against the Vikings that was reminiscent of his dominant days with the Chargers. After a terribly slow start to the season, the veteran wideout has posted a 23-271-4 receiving line over his last four contests. Allen will attempt to keep his recent string of hot play going Week 16 against the Lions on Sunday.</p> <h4 id="david-njoku-te">David Njoku (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Stefanski offered similar availability for Cedric Tillman (concussion), as both he and Njoku were sidelined for Cleveland’s 21-7 loss to the Chiefs in Week 15. After Jameis Winston was benched in favor of Dorian Thompson-Robinson versus Kansas City, however, it remains to be seen who will be under center on the road against the Bengals, even if Njoku manages to retake the field. Wednesday’s first official practice report will reveal more details regarding the standout tight end’s health.</p> <h4 id="brandin-cooks-wr">Brandin Cooks (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> CeeDee Lamb dominated the looks from quarterback Cooper Rush with a 9-116-1 line on 13 targets, and while Cooks finished second on the Cowboys in targets, catches and receiving yards, it was Jalen Tolbert and Jalen Brooks who were on the end of Rush’s other two touchdowns. Cooks has seen limited volume since returning from a knee injury that cost him seven games in the middle of the season, posting a 7-53-2 line on 15 targets over the last three contests, and he’ll be a TD-dependent fantasy option Week 16 against Tampa Bay’s vulnerable secondary.</p> <h4 id="bo-nix-qb">Bo Nix (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Nix reverted to the poor form he showed early in the season, throwing an interception on Denver’s first drive and adding another two picks in the third quarter. He connected with Adam Trautman for a 13-yard touchdown pass in the second quarter, and after Denver’s defense held the fort while Nix found his game, the rookie quarterback created some breathing room with fourth-quarter touchdown passes of 15 and 20 yards to Nate Adkins and Courtland Sutton, respectively. Nix has a 4:5 TD:INT in his last two starts after posting an 8:0 mark over the three preceding games, so he’ll look to clean up the mistakes on a short week Thursday against the Chargers.</p> <h4 id="courtland-sutton-wr">Courtland Sutton (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Sutton was quiet prior to scoring a 20-yard touchdown with 5:48 remaining in the fourth quarter. That play was enough to propel him into the team lead in receiving yards as Bo Nix threw for only 130 yards in this turnover-filled matchup. Sutton has seen at least eight targets in seven consecutive games heading into Thursday’s clash with the Chargers, and this was the first time in that busy stretch that Sutton failed to reach 70 receiving yards.</p> <h4 id="jayden-reed-wr">Jayden Reed (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Reed was more involved after seeing just one target in Week 14 against the Lions, as he tied Christian Watson for the team lead in targets and led the Packers in catches, though four teammates had at least 34 receiving yards as well. Reed also produced 10 yards on two punt returns, one of which he muffed for a fumble but managed to get back on top of the ball. The slumping wide receiver will be a touchdown-dependent fantasy option in Week 16 against the Saints given his sporadic recent usage, but Reed’s a perennial threat to score considering he has 17 total touchdowns through 30 career regular-season games.</p> <h4 id="anthony-richardson-qb">Anthony Richardson (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Richardson scored a 23-yard rushing touchdown on the opening drive, marking his fourth rushing score in the past four games. He hasn’t been nearly as successful with his arm as his with his legs, and Richardson’s accuracy issues unsurprisingly resurfaced against the tough Broncos secondary. He completed just 44.7 percent of his passes and was intercepted twice, dropping his TD:INT as a passer to 7:11. Richardson’s rushing ability should keep him fantasy-relevant in Week 16 against the Titans, but he’ll have a low floor due to his struggles through the air.</p> <h4 id="isiah-pacheco-rb">Isiah Pacheco (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Pacheco and backfield mate Kareem Hunt finished with the same number of carries, one week after Pacheco appeared to reclaim his lead-back role with 16 totes against the Chargers. Hunt actually outgained Pacheco by 13 yards and one target, although the latter did more with his one pass-catching opportunity. The division of labor in the ground attack during a tough Week 16 home matchup Saturday afternoon against the Texans will therefore be interesting to monitor, and if star signal-caller Patrick Mahomes were to miss that game with the ankle injury he suffered Sunday, it could be even tougher sledding on the ground for either back.</p> <h4 id="tre-tucker-wr">Tre Tucker (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Tucker was one of four Raiders pass catchers to earn at least five targets Sunday, but he was by far the least productive. The speedster will remain a boom-or-bust option in Week 15 against a Falcons secondary that just allowed Vikings wideouts Justin Jefferson and Jordan Addison to combine for a 15-265-5 receiving line on 19 targets, though Tucker may be catching passes from quarterback Desmond Ridder after Aidan O’Connell suffered a bone bruise to his left leg Sunday.</p> <h4 id="jordan-addison-wr">Jordan Addison (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Addison tied Justin Jefferson for the team lead in receptions on the night while checking in second behind his teammate in both receiving yards and targets. The talented second-year wideout got off to a hot start, as four of his catches came during two first-half possessions. Addison has logged 21 targets over his last two games and parlayed them into 196 receiving yards heading into a Week 16 road battle against the Seahawks where he should be busy once again.</p> <h4 id="derek-carr-qb">Derek Carr (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Rizzi said it “wouldn’t be a reach” for Carr to retake the field before the conclusion of the regular season, though it remains to be seen whether a road matchup with the Packers on Monday Night Football will be a realistic target for the veteran quarterback. Carr is nursing a fracture in his left, non-throwing hand and is simultaneously working his way through the concussion protocol. Jake Haener was benched early in Sunday’s loss to the Commanders, while Spencer Rattler nearly led the team to a comeback win after entering the game.</p> <h4 id="pat-freiermuth-te">Pat Freiermuth (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Freiermuth saw an increase in role with George Pickens (hamstring) sidelined for the second consecutive week, though the Steelers offense never got going. His stat line was modest as a result, with his primary contribution being a nine-yard touchdown reception just before halftime. Freiermuth has now found the end zone in three straight games while tallying at least three receptions in four straight contests.</p> <h4 id="dk-metcalf-wr">DK Metcalf (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Metcalf actually finished as Seattle’s second-leading receiver despite seeing his fewest targets to date in 2024. That statistic highlights how poor of a passing performance Geno Smith (knee) and Sam Howell combined for against the Packers’ rabid defense. Metcalf has taken a backseat to Jaxon Smith-Njigba (10-83-0) in the second half of the season, but the former still holds fantasy value heading into a Week 16 matchup against the Vikings.</p> <h4 id="zach-charbonnet-rb">Zach Charbonnet (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The entirety of Seattle’s offense was stymied by Green Bay’s defense aside from Charbonnet’s 24-yard touchdown scamper early in the fourth quarter. The surging sophomore has thrived in his last two starts sans Kenneth Walker (calf), unearthing 259 yards from scrimmage with three touchdowns as the Seahawks’ primary back. Walker could potentially return in Week 16, which would put a significant dent in Charbonnet’s value at a crucial point of the fantasy campaign. Until the former is officially ruled active, managers should hang on to the talented backup in the event he draws another start against the Vikings next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="rachaad-white-rb">Rachaad White (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Bucky Irving (back/hip) wound up suiting up after getting injured last week against Las Vegas, leading to an even split in carries between Tampa Bay’s tailbacks. White scored the backfield’s lone touchdown as a receiver while Irving stole the show with 117 rushing yards with his 15 totes. The latter is the preferred fantasy option in this timeshare, but White retains deep-league value for next Sunday’s tilt at Dallas.</p> <h4 id="calvin-ridley-wr">Calvin Ridley (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Ridley saw his fewest targets since Week 4, though he still made explosive plays with the ball in his hands. He tallied long receptions of 21 and 16 yards and supplemented that with a 19-yard rush off the right end late in the third quarter. Even so, Ridley has 60 or fewer yards from scrimmage in four of his last five games.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-height="630" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_15_2024_JST_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-height="630" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_15_2024_JST_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2024-25,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week15"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Fantasy Guru Kayden Week 15 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/blog/2024/Week-15-KTT/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Fantasy Guru Kayden Week 15 Report"/><published>2024-12-17T14:21:22+00:00</published><updated>2024-12-17T14:21:22+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/blog/2024/Week-15-KTT</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/blog/2024/Week-15-KTT/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Fantasy Guru Kayden Won against Michael’s Managable Team 251.24-190.20<br/> Current Standing: #10<br/> Playoff Chances: 0.0%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 88.4%<br/> Best Performer: Josh Allen (41.28 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="kyle-pitts-te">Kyle Pitts (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The struggling tight end saw a welcome uptick in involvement, even as that came accompanied with a modest receiving yardage total. Pitts’ catch and target totals were both team-high figures, and both the reception and yardage tallies also were his best since Week 10. Pitts will look to carry over the momentum into a Week 16 home matchup against the Giants.</p> <h4 id="drake-london-wr">Drake London (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> London led the Falcons in receiving yards and scored the team’s only touchdown on a 30-yard grab in the first quarter. The talented wideout’s trip to the end zone was his first since Week 9, and he was able to eclipse 50 receiving yards for the fifth consecutive contest. London did see a big drop in targets after garnering 26 looks over the previous two games, but Kirk Cousins threw only 17 times overall on the night. London next takes aim at a Giants defense that just gave up five touchdown passes to Lamar Jackson when New York visits Atlanta in Week 16.</p> <h4 id="josh-allen-qb">Josh Allen (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> One week after a record-setting six-touchdown performance, Allen and his juggernaut of an offense actually one-upped themselves in terms of total points. Allen himself fell short of his unforgettable Week 14 effort against the Rams, but he strengthened his MVP case with a mistake-free day that featured a season-high passing yardage total and his third consecutive multi-touchdown-pass tally. Allen’s work on the ground was no less impressive, and his one- and four-yard rushing scores in the first quarter were his fourth and fifth over the last pair of contests. Ryan O’Halloran of The Buffalo News reports that Allen fell on his right throwing shoulder late in the contest and was briefly examined, but he confirmed in his postgame conference that he’d been cleared after an evaluation, per</p> <h4 id="cj-stroud-qb">C.J. Stroud (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Stroud salvaged a performance that featured his second-lowest passing yardage total of the season with a pair of six-yard touchdown passes to Nico Collins in the second and third quarters, respectively. Otherwise, the talented second-year signal-caller scuffled against an aggressive and talented Dolphins defense that sacked him four times. Stroud has a pair of multi-touchdown-pass efforts within a three-game span for only the second time all season heading into a Week 16 Saturday afternoon road showdown against the Chiefs.</p> <h4 id="jonathan-taylor-rb">Jonathan Taylor (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Taylor broke free for what should have been a 41-yard touchdown in the third quarter, but he celebrated early and dropped the ball before crossing the goal line, resulting instead in a fumble that rolled out of the end zone for a touchback. That mistake was the turning point, as the Broncos responded with 24 unanswered points to drop the Colts to 6-8. It also kept Taylor stuck at five rushing touchdowns, the most recent of which came in Week 8. On the bright side, he managed to exceed 100 rushing yards for the fifth time in 11 appearances this season. The workhorse running back should maintain a heavy workload in Week 16 against the 3-11 Titans.</p> <h4 id="kareem-hunt-rb">Kareem Hunt (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Hunt co-led the Chiefs in carries, tying backfield mate Isiah Pacheco in that category while drawing one more target than the latter. It was an interesting development following the Week 15 division of labor between the two, which saw Pacheco outpace Hunt in rush attempts by a 14-5 margin. Whether it’s a one-week outlier or indicative of a stickier trend remains to be seen, but Hunt did outgain Pacheco, who was making only his third appearance since returning from an extended stay on IR due to fractured fibula, by 13 rushing yards.</p> <h4 id="deandre-hopkins-wr">DeAndre Hopkins (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Hopkins finished second in receptions and receiving yards on the afternoon for the Chiefs, although the latter total was particularly unremarkable. Hopkins has at least four catches in four straight games, but he’s been under 40 receiving yards in four of his last five contests overall. Hopkins could continue to struggle with efficiency in a Week 16 home matchup against the Texans on Saturday afternoon if Patrick Mahomes (ankle) is forced to miss the contest and is replaced by Carson Wentz.</p> <h4 id="jakobi-meyers-wr">Jakobi Meyers (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Raiders tried to tap into Meyers’ prior experience as a quarterback with an early trick play against Atlanta, but that plan backfired and resulted in a drive-killing sack. The versatile wideout had a solid receiving night all things considered, leading the Raiders in both targets and yards Monday. Meyers carries a high floor into a soft matchup against the Jaguars on Sunday.</p> <h4 id="zamir-white-rb">Zamir White (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Injured Reserve <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> White’s placement on IR rules him out for Las Vegas’ final four games of the regular season, after the 2022 fourth-round pick had already missed the last three games due to a quad injury. Despite entering the season as the team’s No. 1 running back, White managed just 183 yards (2.8 YPC) and one touchdown on 65 carries while also securing six of eight targets for 30 yards. Alexander Mattison (ankle) and Sincere McCormick remain available atop the Las Vegas depth chart.</p> <h4 id="tj-hockenson-te">T.J. Hockenson (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Hockenson played third wheel in the air attack to Justin Jefferson and Jordan Addison, but the veteran tight end still turned in a solid line that featured his second-highest catch total since Week 10. Hockenson also drew the second-most targets of any of his first seven games since his delayed season debut, and he should once again garner a fair amount of Sam Darnold’s attention in a Week 16 road trip to Seattle.</p> <h4 id="davante-adams-wr">Davante Adams (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Adams was blanked on two first-half targets as Aaron Rodgers completed only three passes before halftime, but the veteran wideout secured a 12-yard reception on the first play of the second half and took over from there. Adams made a 43-yard catch on New York’s second possession of the third quarter and added a one-yard touchdown catch three plays later after having a touchdown ruling reversed on a red-zone reception in between. That touchdown reception was the 100th of Adams’ career and gave the Jets a 17-16 lead. Adams celebrated the occasion by adding an octopus in the fourth quarter, putting the Jets up 23-22 with a career-long 71-yard touchdown catch before extending the advantage to three points by catching the ensuing two-point conversion. To round out this memorable performance, Adams made a sensational 23-yard catch along the sideline followed by a 41-yard reception to set up Breece Hall’s game-winning one-yard rushing touchdown with 1:05 remaining. After the best half of Adams’ illustrious career, he’ll look to put on an encore against the Rams in Week 16.</p> <h4 id="george-pickens-wr">George Pickens (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable</p> <h4 id="sterling-shepard-wr">Sterling Shepard (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Shepard played through the foot issue that had hampered him during the practice week, but he took a back seat to Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan during the high-scoring win. However, Shepard still logged a solid 32 snaps and remains firmly entrenched in the No. 3 receiver role heading into a Week 16 road matchup against the Cowboys.</p> <h4 id="bucky-irving-rb">Bucky Irving (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Irving was listed as questionable ahead of last Sunday’s win over the Raiders and ultimately suited up, but he was limited to just 10 snaps before exiting the game early when his back tightened up. He’s followed a similar practice progression this week compared to last, but his condition has reportedly improved. Though Irving should be cleared to play in advance of Sunday’s 4:25 p.m. ET kickoff, he will be difficult to trust in the fantasy playoffs while he faces a tough road matchup.</p> <h4 id="will-levis-qb">Will Levis (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Levis was benched during Tennessee’s 37-27 loss to the Bengals in Week 15 after accounting for four turnovers (three interceptions and one lost fumble). He otherwise completed eight of 12 passes for 89 yards and zero touchdowns. Rudolph looked more competent, if unremarkable, in relief of Levis, completing 21 of 26 passes for 209 yards with two touchdowns and one interception, while also rushing twice for 14 yards. In order to properly divvy up first-team reps, the Titans may make an official decision at the quarterback position for Week 16 prior to Wednesday’s practice.</p> <h4 id="brian-robinson-jr-rb">Brian Robinson Jr. (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Robinson struggled as a runner Sunday, averaging just 3.1 yards per carry despite tying his season high in carries (21). The 25-year-old helped offset his inefficient rushing day with the second-highest yardage total as a receiver through 11 active games this year. Robinson will continue to lead Washington’s backfield as the team prepares to host Philadelphia next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="zach-ertz-te">Zach Ertz (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Ertz was checked for a head injury in the second quarter before the Commanders made a ruling on his availability for the rest of Week 15. He’ll finish the contest with two catches (on two targets) for 25 yards. John Bates and Ben Sinnott will handle TE reps for Washington in the second half and potentially beyond that point.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-height="630" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_15_2024_KTT_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-height="630" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_15_2024_KTT_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2024-25,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week15"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Michael’s Managable Team Week 15 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/blog/2024/Week-15-MMT/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Michael’s Managable Team Week 15 Report"/><published>2024-12-17T14:21:22+00:00</published><updated>2024-12-17T14:21:22+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/blog/2024/Week-15-MMT</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/blog/2024/Week-15-MMT/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Michael’s Managable Team Lost against Fantasy Guru Kayden 190.20-251.24<br/> Current Standing: #9<br/> Playoff Chances: 0.0%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 88.4%<br/> Best Performer: James Cook (25.80 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="trey-benson-rb">Trey Benson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Benson suffered an ankle injury in the second half, bringing his day to a close after he turned five carries into 22 yards against New England. In his absence, James Conner will continue to handle the lion’s share of touches at running back in Week 15.</p> <h4 id="james-cook-rb">James Cook (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Cook got in on the fun of the Bills’ second straight 40-plus-point barrage, crossing the goal line on the ground from six and 41 yards out in the second and third quarters, respectively. The third-year pro has two of his three 100-yard efforts on the season within the last three games, and his receiving yardage total Sunday was his highest since Week 3. Cook draws a highly favorable matchup against the Patriots at home in Week 16.</p> <h4 id="xavier-legette-wr">Xavier Legette (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Doubtful <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Canales said he would “love to have a chance for [Legette] to finish the season strongly,” but the rookie first-round pick is expected to miss at least one contest due to the groin injury he sustained during Carolina’s 30-14 loss to the Cowboys in Week 15. If Legette indeed isn’t able to suit up versus Arizona, Adam Thielen, Jalen Coker and David Moore will be positioned as Bryce Young’s clear top wide receivers, with Deven Thompkins acting in the No. 4 role.</p> <h4 id="ceedee-lamb-wr">CeeDee Lamb (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Lamb was peppered with targets throughout the game, as he accounted for 116 of Cooper Rush’s 214 passing yards. He delivered long gains of 28 and 20 yards, while also finding the end zone from 14 yards away to tally the Cowboys’ first touchdown of the game. Most importantly, Lamb looked to be healthier after being slowed by a shoulder injury for the last several weeks.</p> <h4 id="sam-laporta-te">Sam LaPorta (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Several of Detroit’s primary pass catchers posted inflated stat lines as Jared Goff was forced to take to the air 59 times in negative game script. LaPorta delivered his best yardage total of the season as a result, highlighted by long gains of 31 and 22 yards to record the second 100-yard performance of his career. The Lions aren’t likely to be down multiple scores often for the rest of the campaign, making this an outlier performance, though it was positive to see LaPorta finish second on the team in targets.</p> <h4 id="dontayvion-wicks-wr">Dontayvion Wicks (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Wicks tied Tucker Kraft for second in targets and Christian Watson for the team lead in receptions, although he was a distant second to the latter in receiving yards. Nevertheless, it was notable that Wicks logged four more targets than No. 1 receiver Jayden Reed, who went without a catch. Wicks has back-to-back four-reception outings heading into a Week 15 road matchup against the Seahawks on Sunday night, Dec. 15, but he could be looking at a reduced role if Romeo Doubs (concussion) returns for that game.</p> <h4 id="hollywood-brown-wr">Hollywood Brown (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Injured Reserve <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> A previous report suggested it would happen either Friday or Monday, after Chiefs coach Andy Reid confirmed earlier this week that Brown was almost ready to practice. Brown won’t play against Cleveland this Sunday and might be viewed as a long shot for Week 16, but it seems he’ll return before the end of the regular season unless he suffers a setback in practice. There’s now a 21-day window in which Brown can practice without being activated to the 53-man roster.</p> <h4 id="justin-herbert-qb">Justin Herbert (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Herbert has been dealing with ankle and thigh issues for the last couple weeks, and he appeared to aggravate the ankle in Sunday’s loss to the Bucs, though he missed just one offensive snap. The limited start to the week would suggest Herbert has a good chance to suit up Thursday night against the Broncos. If Herbert isn’t cleared to play, Taylor Heinicke would likely draw in as the starter.</p> <h4 id="demario-douglas-wr">DeMario Douglas (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Douglas came out of New England’s bye week in good health and rewarded deep-league managers with his second touchdown of the season. The sophomore starter has quietly provided value for those in PPR formats with a 55-508-2 receiving line through 14 games. With his ankle injury in the rearview mirror, Douglas remains serviceable to those in the aforementioned formats against the Bills next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="rhamondre-stevenson-rb">Rhamondre Stevenson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Stevenson spearheaded the Patriots’ rushing attack Sunday, grinding out 85 total yards for fantasy mangers in yet another loss. The Oklahoma product received double-digit carries for sixth time over his last seven appearances while backup Antonio Gibson chipped in seven rushing attempts for 33 yards. Stevenson has quietly posted a decent fantasy campaign (193-740-6) despite being a north-south runner on an 11-loss team. Things won’t get any easier for Stevenson and the Patriots as the team heads back to the east coast to face the Bills next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="drake-maye-qb">Drake Maye (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Maye scored a pair of garbage-time touchdowns in the fourth quarter to help pad his fantasy line, but the rookie couldn’t avoid throwing an interception for the sixth week in a row. The North Carolina product now owns a poor 1.3 TD/INT ratio through nine starts as a rookie. Maye could see a bump in projections in a road tilt against the Bills, assuming the Patriots fall behind big early and the weather is tolerable in Buffalo. That said, his value is limited to two-QB formats in Week 16.</p> <h4 id="kendre-miller-rb">Kendre Miller (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Miller was hardly involved for most of the game but had to shoulder a bigger workload after RB1 Alvin Kamara exited with a groin injury early in the fourth quarter. The second-year backup logged eight carries and his lone target during this quarter, and he finished with a career high in rushing yards. Meanwhile, RB3 Jamaal Williams finished without a carry or a target. Kamara did not return before the end of Sunday’s contest, leaving his status uncertain for next week’s contest versus Green Bay on Monday, Dec. 23. Should he miss time, then Miller should be in line to step in as the feature back for New Orleans.</p> <h4 id="saquon-barkley-rb">Saquon Barkley (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Barkley missed nearly the entire second quarter with an undisclosed issue, though he handled 12 carries in the final two quarters to alleviate any injury concerns. It still wasn’t a spectacular showing, as he was largely held in check by the Steelers, with the only exception being a 22-yard gain late in the first quarter. Barkley was also denied a touchdown for the second consecutive game, though he should have a chance to bounce back in Week 16 against the Commanders.</p> <h4 id="jaylen-warren-rb">Jaylen Warren (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Pat Freiermuth was the only Steelers’ skill-position player to deliver a useful fantasy performance as the offense ran only 41 plays for the game. Warren did avoid any back-breaking mistakes, unlike Najee Harris, though this marked his fewest yards from scrimmage since Week 3. Warren’s usage on the ground has been inconsistent this season, though he’s had more regular production as a pass catcher and should have the chance to bounce back in that role in a Week 16 matchup against Baltimore.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-height="630" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_15_2024_MMT_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-height="630" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_15_2024_MMT_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2024-25,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week15"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Pink Pony Club Week 15 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/blog/2024/Week-15-PONY/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Pink Pony Club Week 15 Report"/><published>2024-12-17T14:21:22+00:00</published><updated>2024-12-17T14:21:22+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/blog/2024/Week-15-PONY</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/blog/2024/Week-15-PONY/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Pink Pony Club Won against Tom and Jerry 366.24-307.18<br/> Current Standing: #1<br/> Playoff Chances: 100.0%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 87.0%<br/> Best Performer: James Conner (28.30 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="james-conner-rb">James Conner (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Conner was the star on offense for Arizona on Sunday, punching in a pair of short touchdowns while cracking the century mark in rushing yards for the fifth time this season. The bruising tailback combined for 21 touches, finishing well ahead of backup Trey Benson’s five against New England. Conner remains the bell cow for a 7-7 Cardinals squad that will hit the road in Week 16 to face Carolina next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="rashod-bateman-wr">Rashod Bateman (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Bateman recorded a team-high receiving yardage total while also coming down with multiple touchdown catches for the first time in his career. The fourth-year pro managed 49- and 20-yard scoring grabs in the second quarter, leading him to his best yardage tally since Week 7. Bateman will aim to put together a successful encore at the expense of the division-rival Steelers in a Week 16 Saturday afternoon matchup.</p> <h4 id="khalil-shakir-wr">Khalil Shakir (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Shakir paced the Bills in receptions and tied for the team lead in targets while scoring a touchdown for the second straight game on a three-yard grab late in the third quarter. Shakir has at least five catches in six of the last seven games, affording him a solid PPR floor heading into a Week 16 home matchup against the Patriots.</p> <h4 id="adam-thielen-wr">Adam Thielen (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Panthers couldn’t get their passing attack on track, with the only explosive play being an 83-yard touchdown pass to Jalen Coker. Thus, despite leading the team in targets and receptions, Thielen turned in a modest performance. Positively, he should remain Bryce Young’s top target, though the overall state of the Carolina offense may lead to inconsistent results.</p> <h4 id="jameis-winston-qb">Jameis Winston (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Prior to yielding QB duties to Thompson-Robinson midway through the final quarter, Winston completed 16 of 25 passes for 146 yards, no touchdowns and three interceptions, was sacked five times for a combined loss of 37 yards and had two carries for minus-2 yards. On the Browns’ only score, Winston handed the ball off to Jerome Ford, who did the rest of the work on a 62-yard TD. Thompson-Robinson didn’t fare better than Winston on his two possessions: 4-for-9 passing for 18 yards and a pick and three rushes for 16 yards. It’s unclear when Stefanski may make a call between the two ahead of next Sunday’s game at Cincinnati, but Winston seems to be in danger of getting benched, at least in the short term.</p> <h4 id="jahmyr-gibbs-rb">Jahmyr Gibbs (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Gibbs piled up 114 yards from scrimmage and two touchdowns during Sunday’s loss to Buffalo, a contest in which Detroit was forced to play from behind and adopt a pass-heavy approach. Montgomery’s MCL injury seems to have also factored into Gibbs’ elevated role, rather than the two operating in a fairly even timeshare, as per usual. Now, with Montgomery potentially in danger of missing the remainder of the 2024 campaign, per Ian Rapoport of NFL Network, Gibbs seems to be facing a clear path to workhorse opportunities down the stretch, making him matchup-proof. Gibbs hasn’t required a hefty workload in order to produce this season, but with Craig Reynolds and Sione Vaki now positioned as his top complementary options, he’s the Lions’ clear No. 1 RB heading into a road matchup against the Bears in Week 16.</p> <h4 id="nico-collins-wr">Nico Collins (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Collins’ receiving yardage total was easily his lowest of the season, but the ultra-talented receiver salvaged his fantasy day with a pair of six-yard touchdown catches. He has at least four receptions in four consecutive games, but if there’s any quibble with his body of work, it’s the fact he has just one 100-yard performance in his last five games, which occurred Week 13 against the lowly Jaguars. Collins will look to boost his non-TD production back up in a Week 16 Saturday afternoon clash on the road with the Chiefs.</p> <h4 id="brian-thomas-jr-wr">Brian Thomas Jr. (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Thomas has proven capable of overcoming mediocre quarterback play as a rookie, accounting for both of Mac Jones’ touchdown passes in this latest Jacksonville loss. The 23rd overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft capped the opening drive with a three-yard touchdown catch and added a go-ahead 19-yard touchdown reception with 10:58 remaining in the fourth. Thomas topped 100 receiving yards for just the second time while posting the first multi-touchdown performance of his young career. He’ll take a streak of four consecutive games with at least 76 receiving yards into a Week 16 trip to Vegas.</p> <h4 id="sincere-mccormick-rb">Sincere McCormick (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> McCormick was injured on a one-yard carry in the second quarter. He was deemed questionable to return ahead of Las Vegas’ next offensive drive, then ruled out after halftime. McCormick logged eight yards on seven carries along with 17 yards on two receptions prior to exiting. The Raiders backfield will consist of Alexander Mattison, Ameer Abdullah and Dylan Laube for the remainder of the game.</p> <h4 id="kyren-williams-rb">Kyren Williams (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Williams accomplished the unlikely feat of recording 29 rush attempts for the second time in a four-day span, a testament to his ability to handle a true workhorse role while remaining productive. The third-year pro posted a new season-high single-game rushing yardage total in the process, as well as his third 100-yard effort of the campaign. Williams now will have some much-needed extra down time ahead of a Week 16 road battle against the Jets on Sunday, Dec. 22.</p> <h4 id="juwan-johnson-te">Juwan Johnson (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Johnson caught two passes from quarterback Spencer Rattler in the second half. The rookie signal-caller took over from Jake Haener, who was benched after the Saints went scoreless in the first half. Johnson had a chance to secure a comeback win after fellow tight end Foster Moreau caught a one-yard touchdown as time expired in the fourth quarter, but Johnson failed to connect with Rattler on the ensuing two-point conversion attempt. Johnson had caught a touchdown pass in two of the previous three games, but he and Moreau have continued to negate one another fantasy’s relevance by splitting snaps and targets. This will likely remain the case during next week’s road contest at Green Bay on Monday, Dec. 23.</p> <h4 id="tyrone-tracy-jr-rb">Tyrone Tracy Jr. (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Tracy predictably saw only a modest amount of opportunity in a game that eventually got away from the Giants as expected. The rookie running back now has four straight sub-50-yard totals on the ground, and his receiving production Sunday was his lowest since Week 10. Tracy should have a good chance of bouncing back in a favorable Week 16 road matchup against the Falcons, although it bears noting he outpaced backfield mate Devin Singletary by only two carries Sunday.</p> <h4 id="jalen-hurts-qb">Jalen Hurts (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The effectiveness of the Eagles’ passing attack was in question throughout the week, as Hurts had failed to top 200 passing yards in three straight games. He silenced those questions in an excellent Week 15 showing by averaging 9.1 yards per attempt while completing six passes of at least 20 yards. Hurts also threw for multiple touchdowns for only the sixth time this season, while supplementing it with his 14th rushing score of the campaign. All of that production came despite playing through a broken finger, an injury that Hurts confirmed after the game, per Jeff McLane of The Philadelphia Inquirer.</p> <h4 id="deebo-samuel-sr-wr">Deebo Samuel Sr. (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The biggest play of Samuel’s night came on the 41-yard kickoff return he rattled off to start the 49ers’ final possession, and the horse collar tackle he was brought down with tacked on an additional 15 yards. His work on offense once again was highly underwhelming, however, and he’s now finished with 22 receiving yards or fewer in five straight contests. Samuel’s next opportunity to reverse his fortunes comes in a Week 16 road battle against the Dolphins on Sunday, Dec. 22.</p> <h4 id="isaac-guerendo-rb">Isaac Guerendo (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Guerendo overcame the foot sprain he’d suffered in the Week 14 win over the Bears on Sunday to suit up and handle all of San Francisco’s running back touches. However, the rookie surprisingly found some tough sledding against a Rams defense that has been beatable on the ground at times this season. Nevertheless, Guerendo impressively handled a solid workload in wet conditions and finished as the co-leader in receptions as well, and he’ll have a secure fantasy floor as the clear lead back when the 49ers travel to face the Dolphins on Sunday, Dec. 22.</p> <h4 id="cade-otton-te">Cade Otton (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Starting wideouts Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan combined for 14 receptions, 238 yards and three touchdown catches, leaving little else for the rest of Tampa Bay’s air attack. That included Otton, who posted his lowest yardage total since Week 6 and tied his second-lowest target tally of the campaign as well. Nevertheless, the third-year tight end remains an important complementary part of the passing game and could see an uptick in work during a favorable Week 16 road matchup against the Cowboys.</p> <h4 id="terry-mclaurin-wr">Terry McLaurin (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> McLaurin teamed up with quarterback Jayden Daniels to score both of Washington’s touchdowns on the day. It was Scary Terry’s second consecutive game with multiple trips to the end zone, and his fourth overall this season (11 total touchdowns). The 28-year-old is just 31 yards shy of recording his fifth 1,000-yard campaign in his sixth season with the Commanders. McLaurin should accomplish the feat with ease in a pivotal matchup against the Eagles next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="jayden-daniels-qb">Jayden Daniels (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Daniels picked apart the opposition by completing 81 percent of his passes while using his legs to extend multiple drives in Sunday’s one-point victory. The promising rookie recorded his fourth game with multiple touchdowns and no turnovers through 14 starts as a pro. As of the conclusion of this game, the 9-5 Commanders still have an outside shot at the NFC East title, so expect inspired play from Daniels against the first-place Eagles next Sunday.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-height="630" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_15_2024_PONY_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-height="630" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_15_2024_PONY_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2024-25,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week15"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Hit and Ruggs Week 15 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/blog/2024/Week-15-RRT/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hit and Ruggs Week 15 Report"/><published>2024-12-17T14:21:22+00:00</published><updated>2024-12-17T14:21:22+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/blog/2024/Week-15-RRT</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/blog/2024/Week-15-RRT/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Hit and Ruggs Lost against To Infinity and Bijan! 229.66-255.56<br/> Current Standing: #6<br/> Playoff Chances: 0.0%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 85.2%<br/> Best Performer: Jared Goff (41.06 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="marvin-harrison-jr-wr">Marvin Harrison Jr. (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> It was an inefficient day at the office for Harrison, who recorded just 32 receiving yards on a 33 percent catch rate. A one-sided game script in favor of Arizona also hurt the wideout’s fantasy potential Sunday, as this contest was never close despite the 13-point difference once the game clock hit zero. Harrison owns a 47-687-7 receiving line through 14 starts as a rookie, with his next chance to play coming in a road tilt against Carolina next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="trey-mcbride-te">Trey McBride (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> McBride continued his dominance in between the 20s with another big PPR effort that resulted in no touchdowns. The 24-year-old has shockingly recorded 89 receptions for 938 yards with zero trips to the end zone in 13 starts this season. It will be curious to see if the budding tight end will reach the 1,000-yard receiving mark or score his first touchdown of 2024 first. We could find out the answer when McBride and the Cardinals face the Panthers next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="diontae-johnson-wr">Diontae Johnson (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Johnson was suspended by Baltimore for Week 15 due to conduct detrimental to the team, but even after his suspension is officially lifted, the veteran wideout won’t be back in the building to prepare for Saturday’s divisional matchup against the Steelers. Since joining the Ravens in a trade with the Panthers back in October, Johnson has failed to solidify his standing in Baltimore’s wide receiver corps. At this point, it remains to be seen whether the veteran wideout will return to team activities Week 17.</p> <h4 id="rome-odunze-wr">Rome Odunze (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Odunze was unable to replicate his two-score game from a week prior, instead providing fantasy managers with just two receptions in Monday’s lopsided loss. The Bears’ first-round rookies struggled to get on the same page after Caleb Williams connected with Odunze on just 29 percent of his throws against Minnesota. Odunze has potential to go off on a given week, but his floor is too low to rely on against the Lions on Sunday for managers making critical lineup decisions in the fantasy playoffs.</p> <h4 id="chase-brown-rb">Chase Brown (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Brown scored his fourth receiving touchdown of the season on a six-yard catch in the first quarter and added his seventh rushing touchdown on a five-yard run with 1:09 remaining in the fourth quarter. The 2023 third-round pick also came just three yards shy of his second career 100-yard rushing performance. Brown has excelled in the lead role with seven total touchdowns in his last seven games, and he’ll look to keep rolling in Week 16 against the Browns.</p> <h4 id="jared-goff-qb">Jared Goff (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Lions went down 14-0 in the first quarter and played from behind the entire contest, which led to a season-high 59 pass attempts for Goff. He converted that into an excellent stat line, including his second-most yards in any game of his career while matching a career-high with five touchdowns. He also completed five passes of at least 20 yards, highlighted by a 66-yard touchdown connection with Amon-Ra St. Brown late in the third quarter. While this was an outlier performance, Goff has at least three passing scores in half of Detroit’s 10 games since their Week 5 bye and should remain an excellent starting option heading into a Week 16 matchup against the Bears.</p> <h4 id="cooper-kupp-wr">Cooper Kupp (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The wet conditions certainly played a role, but seeing Kupp finish without a catch for the first time since Week 10 of the 2019 season and second time in his career still was shocking, not to mention especially ill-timed from a fantasy perspective. Kupp had entered Thursday with at least 60 receiving yards in five of the previous six games, and he’ll naturally have nowhere to go but up in a Week 16 road matchup against the Jets on Sunday, Dec. 22.</p> <h4 id="jaylen-waddle-wr">Jaylen Waddle (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Waddle’s status appears murky for Miami’s upcoming matchup against the 49ers on Sunday, but it at least appears he’s avoided a more severe outcome. Tyreek Hill remains available for the Dolphins, and if Waddle can’t go Week 16, rookie sixth-round pick Malik Washington would be in a solid position to build upon the career-best 5-52-0 receiving line that he logged versus Houston. Further clarity on Waddle’s status could arrive with Wednesday’s first official injury report of Week 16.</p> <h4 id="devon-achane-rb">De’Von Achane (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Achane doubled up Raheem Mostert in carries and finished with his highest rushing yardage total since Week 11. While Achane failed to average even 4.0 yards per carry for the fourth straight contest, he was once again heavily involved as a receiver. He’s recorded at least six catches in three straight games, but he’ll aim to get back on track on the ground in a Week 16 home matchup against a 49ers defense that’s had trouble against the run on occasion.</p> <h4 id="justin-jefferson-wr">Justin Jefferson (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Jefferson brought in Sam Darnold’s only touchdown pass of the night on a seven-yard catch with just over five minutes remaining in the first quarter. Jefferson tied Jordan Addison for the team lead in receptions and set the pace in both receiving yards and targets, a familiar position for the star wideout. Jefferson has eclipsed 70 receiving yards in four of the last five games and also has three total scores in the last pair of contests heading into a Week 16 road battle against the Seahawks.</p> <h4 id="sam-darnold-qb">Sam Darnold (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Vikings had the luxury of running a balanced attack against the hapless Bears, so Darnold didn’t have to do anywhere near as much as he had against the Falcons in Week 14. However, the veteran quarterback still put together a solid effort that saw him connect with seven different targets overall, including starting wideouts Justin Jefferson and Jordan Addison seven times apiece. Darnold’s one scoring toss went to Jefferson as well from seven yards out with just over five minutes remaining in the first quarter, extending his streak with at least one touchdown pass to five games. Darnold now will turn his sights to what could be a tough Week 16 road date with the Seahawks on a short week.</p> <h4 id="antonio-gibson-rb">Antonio Gibson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Gibson followed up his first touchdown of the season with a well-rounded effort behind starter Rhamondre Stevenson (13-69-0). The 26-year-old Gibson is averaging 4.7 yards with the Patriots this season, a mark he hadn’t sniffed since his impressive rookie campaign with Washington in 2020. Gibson can provide niche value for those in deep PPR formats for Week 16 against Buffalo.</p> <h4 id="wandale-robinson-wr">Wan’Dale Robinson (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Robinson finished a distant runner-up across the board in all three receiving categories to Malik Nabers. The reliable third-year pro eclipsed the 70-catch mark on the season (71) with Sunday’s production, and he heads into a favorable Week 16 road matchup against the Falcons with at least four receptions in four of the last five contests.</p> <h4 id="allen-lazard-wr">Allen Lazard (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Lazard has displayed butter fingers throughout his tenure with the Jets, and he had an especially costly drop Sunday on a dime from Aaron Rodgers that should have been a 30-yard touchdown. Anders Carlson missed a field-goal attempt on the very next play, though Lazard’s struggles ultimately didn’t prevent the Jets from notching their fourth win of the season. For the second consecutive game since Lazard returned from IR, Davante Adams and Garrett Wilson combined for double-digit catches and well over 200 yards, leaving limited opportunities for the team’s No. 3 wideout.</p> <h4 id="breece-hall-rb">Breece Hall (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Hall wasn’t efficient in his return after a one-game absence due to a knee injury, and he ceded a combined seven carries to Isaiah Davis and Braelon Allen, the latter of whom exited due to a back injury. The lead back salvaged his fantasy stat line with a one-yard rushing touchdown, which broke a 25-25 tie with 1:05 left in the fourth quarter. If Hall avoids any setbacks in practice, he’ll likely get a larger workload in Week 16 against the Rams.</p> <h4 id="braelon-allen-rb">Braelon Allen (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Before his departure, Allen carried twice for five yards. While he is sidelined, Breece Hall and Isaiah Davis are available to handle the Jets’ backfield duties versus Jacksonville.</p> <h4 id="dallas-goedert-te">Dallas Goedert (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Injured Reserve <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> This was reported earlier by various sources, but it was officially confirmed by the team later in the day. Grant Calcaterra and C.J. Uzomah will be tasked with taking on the work vacated by Goedert, who will be eligible to return during the team’s final week of the regular season.</p> <h4 id="geno-smith-qb">Geno Smith (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Smith took a low hit from a Packers defender in the middle of the third quarter of Sunday’s loss and limped to the sideline and eventually the locker room. He returned to the bench not long after, but he didn’t retake the field, yielding QB duties to Sam Howell for the remainder of the contest. It seems that Smith has dodged a bullet, but it remains to be seen if he’ll be able to do enough to gain clearance for this coming Sunday’s game against the Vikings.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-height="630" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_15_2024_RRT_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-height="630" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_15_2024_RRT_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2024-25,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week15"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">To Infinity and Bijan!

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="bijan-robinson-rb">Bijan Robinson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Robinson had clear control of the Falcons’ ground game once again, although backfield mate Tyler Allgeier logged 12 carries of his own as part of a run-centric game plan. Robinson eclipsed the 100-yard mark for the fourth time this season in the process, doing so with a figure that qualified as a new season high. The second-year back has now encouragingly logged at least 22 carries in three straight contests, and he could potentially put together an even better performance against the Giants’ suspect run defense in a Week 16 home matchup.</p> <h4 id="darnell-mooney-wr">Darnell Mooney (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The quick upgrade from limited participation to full confirms Mooney will be ready for Monday’s game at Las Vegas. He was one of the few Falcons to thrive Week 14, catching six of seven targets for 142 yards in a 42-21 loss at Minnesota.</p> <h4 id="dalton-kincaid-te">Dalton Kincaid (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Making his return from a three-game absence due to a knee injury, Kincaid finished third in receptions and receiving yards while sharing the team lead in targets. Kincaid’s yardage tally was actually a new season high, and he’s posted a trio of four-reception efforts in his last four games dating back to Week 8.</p> <h4 id="cole-kmet-te">Cole Kmet (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Despite the Bears playing from behind all afternoon, Caleb Williams attempted just 23 passes. Chicago simply couldn’t move the football versus San Francisco and ran just 52 offensive plays. Kmet was on the field for 92 percent of the offensive downs, and he’s played at least 92 percent of the snaps in five consecutive games. That playing time alone keeps him on the fantasy radar ahead of a Week 15 date with the Vikings.</p> <h4 id="mike-gesicki-te">Mike Gesicki (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Gesicki finished a distant third on the team in receiving yards behind Ja’Marr Chase (94) and Tee Higgins (88). The veteran tight end has accounted for only two of Joe Burrow’s league-leading 36 touchdown passes heading into a Week 16 home game against the Browns, but Gesicki has carved out a passable floor with at least three catches in each of his last three games.</p> <h4 id="tee-higgins-wr">Tee Higgins (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Higgins caught a 38-yard touchdown pass in the second quarter to break a 14-14 tie, and the Bengals led the rest of the way. He trailed only Ja’Marr Chase in targets, catches and receiving yards, finishing six yards shy of Chase’s team-leading total. Higgins has at least 77 receiving yards in five of his last seven appearances and six touchdowns over that span, so he’s been excellent when available. That production included 82 yards and a touchdown in Week 7 against the Browns, whom Higgins will face again Week 16.</p> <h4 id="amon-ra-st-brown-wr">Amon-Ra St. Brown (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Lions were forced into a pass-heavy offense as they chased the Bills all game, and the result was a career-best performance for St. Brown. The highlight came on a 66-yard touchdown catch and run, during which St. Brown split the Buffalo defense down the middle and out-raced several defenders to the end zone. He also chipped in long gains of 24, 31 and 16 yards to top 100 yards for the fourth time this season and for the first time since Week 11.</p> <h4 id="michael-pittman-jr-wr">Michael Pittman Jr. (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Pittman fumbled at the end of a six-yard catch in the third quarter, but he led the Colts in targets, catches and receiving yards. Josh Downs had only 32 yards on eight targets after missing one game due to a shoulder injury, and Alec Pierce exited due to a concussion just before halftime. Pittman has at least seven targets in each of the past four games and should maintain a prominent role in the Colts’ lackluster passing attack in Week 16 against the Titans.</p> <h4 id="tank-bigsby-rb">Tank Bigsby (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> After out-touching Travis Etienne, 19-8, in Week 14 against the Titans, Bigsby returned to a complementary role against the Jets, finishing with 11 touches to Etienne’s 18. They’ll likely continue to work as a tandem in Week 16, when the Jaguars could have a more run-heavy game script than usual in a battle between bottom-feeders against the Raiders. Bigsby has just five catches all season, so he relies almost exclusively on rushing contributions while the versatile Etienne can play in all situations.</p> <h4 id="quentin-johnston-wr">Quentin Johnston (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The ankle injury is new for Johnston, so his practice status bears monitoring over the next couple of days ahead of Thursday night’s game against the Broncos. Johnston’s 73 percent snap share against the Bucs on Sunday was right in line with his norm, so it’s unclear when he was injured. He finished with a 5-45-1 line on a season-high 10 targets. If Johnston were to miss Week 16, Joshua Palmer, Jalen Reagor and DJ Chark would be in line to handle outside wide receiver snaps, with rookie Ladd McConkey spending most of his time in the slot.</p> <h4 id="raheem-mostert-rb">Raheem Mostert (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Mostert made his return from a one-game absence due to a hip injury, and he finished with his third single-digit rushing yardage total in the last four games. Mostert’s reception total was a new season high, yet it’s clear he’s a distant second fiddle, at best, to De’Von Achane in Miami’s unproductive ground attack barring an injury to the latter.</p> <h4 id="devin-singletary-rb">Devin Singletary (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Singletary tied his highest carry total since Week 4, the last game in which he was still considered the lead back before Tyrone Tracy usurped him for the role. Singletary logged only two fewer carries than his backfield mate Sunday, and his two-yard rushing touchdown late in the first half was his fourth of the campaign. The veteran back should retain a solid complementary role at minimum in a Week 16 road matchup against the vulnerable Falcons defense.</p> <h4 id="aaron-rodgers-qb">Aaron Rodgers (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Rodgers posted his third-highest passing yardage total of the campaign while setting a new season high in rushing yards in this throwback performance. He answered an opening-drive Jaguars touchdown with a 22-yard touchdown pass to Garrett Wilson, but the veteran quarterback finished the first half with just three completions and 55 passing yards. Rodgers bounced back in the third quarter with a go-ahead one-yard touchdown pass to Davante Adams, whom Rodgers connected with for a 43-yard gain earlier on the drive. After the Jets fell behind 22-17 in the fourth quarter, Rodgers found Adams for a 71-yard touchdown and a two-point conversion to take a three-point lead with 3:24 remaining, then linked up with Adams for a 41-yard gain to set up Breece Hall’s game-winning touchdown run. Adams accounted for 198 of Rodgers’ 289 passing yards, and their chemistry will be tough for the Rams to stop in Week 16.</p> <h4 id="russell-wilson-qb">Russell Wilson (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Eagles dominated time of possession, and the Steelers ran only offensive 41 plays. That was due in part to Wilson’s inability to move the Pittsburgh offense, as the unit totaled -19 yards through their five possessions while picking up only 163 net yards for the game. The end result was Wilson’s lowest yardage total as the team’s starter and his second consecutive performance with less than 160 passing yards with George Pickens (hamstring) sidelined. Though Baltimore’s passing defense, which Pittsburgh’s offense will face next Saturday, has been leaky at times, it will be difficult to trust Wilson moving forward – particularly as long as Pickens is out.</p> <h4 id="kenneth-walker-iii-rb">Kenneth Walker III (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Walker has missed back-to-back contests due to a calf injury, and he also hasn’t practiced since Wednesday, Dec. 4. Macdonald added, “We’ll see,” regarding Walker’s chances to take the field Wednesday, when the Seahawks are slated for their first session of Week 16 prep. Zach Charbonnet has filled in for Walker during his absence, turning 38 touches into 259 yards from scrimmage and three rushing TDs, and even Kenny McIntosh has got some run (12 touches for 54 total yards).</p> <h4 id="tyler-lockett-wr">Tyler Lockett (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Since the Seahawks’ Week 10 bye, Lockett has averaged just 15.4 receiving yards per game while failing to find the end zone. Meanwhile, second-year wideout Jaxon Smith-Njigba has been a target hog, tallying a team-high 12 targets in Week 15. It will be tough to depend on Lockett for fantasy purposes moving forward.</p> <h4 id="mike-evans-wr">Mike Evans (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Evans showed no ill effects from the hamstring injury that limited him during the practice week, ripping off two long touchdown receptions in Sunday’s lopsided victory. The nine receptions and 159 yards both marked new highs for the superstar wideout in 2024. Evans likely helped many fantasy managers advance in their respective playoff schedule, and he could be in for an encore against a middling Cowboys squad on Sunday Night Football in Week 16.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-height="630" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_15_2024_TIB_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-height="630" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_15_2024_TIB_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2024-25,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week15"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Tom and Jerry Week 15 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/blog/2024/Week-15-TOM/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Tom and Jerry Week 15 Report"/><published>2024-12-17T14:21:22+00:00</published><updated>2024-12-17T14:21:22+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/blog/2024/Week-15-TOM</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/blog/2024/Week-15-TOM/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Tom and Jerry Lost against Pink Pony Club 307.18-366.24<br/> Current Standing: #4<br/> Playoff Chances: 100.0%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 86.3%<br/> Best Performer: Baker Mayfield (28.02 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="justice-hill-rb">Justice Hill (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Hill made an additional mark outside of fantasy matchups when he ripped off a 59-yard return on special teams. Baltimore’s talented backup recorded his fourth touchdown of the season on quarterback Lamar Jackson’s fifth passing touchdown of the game. Hill remains a boom-or-bust option (due to his limited usage) for those in deeper leagues as the Ravens prepare to host the Steelers on Saturday.</p> <h4 id="jerome-ford-rb">Jerome Ford (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Ford opened the game in his usual complementary role behind Nick Chubb, but the latter eventually exited the game due to what was subsequently determined to be a broken foot. Ford broke off a 62-yard touchdown run late in the fourth quarter to account for the majority of his yardage, but he should be poised to handle a lead-back role moving forward for what remains of the season with Chubb sidelined.</p> <h4 id="jerry-jeudy-wr">Jerry Jeudy (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Jeudy comfortably led the Browns in receptions, receiving yards and targets on an afternoon when Jameis Winston and Dorian Thompson-Robinson combined for just 154 passing yards and threw four interceptions between them. The 2020 first-round pick of the Broncos is putting the finishing touches on a career year despite his team’s struggles, now boasting a 70-1,052-4 line across 14 games. Both the reception and receiving yardage totals are new high-water marks for the talented wideout, but he could see a downturn in production over the final three games if head coach Kevin Stefanski opts to turn to the erratic Thompson-Robinson at quarterback the rest of the way following Winston’s benching Sunday.</p> <h4 id="jake-ferguson-te">Jake Ferguson (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Dallas was able to take its foot off the gas in the second half thanks to a multi-score lead, and Cooper Rush attempted nine passes in the final two quarters. That limited volume for all pass catchers with the exception of CeeDee Lamb, and Ferguson saw only four targets – good for third on the team – as a result. The game script should look different in a Week 16 showdown with Tampa Bay, giving Ferguson a better chance to produce.</p> <h4 id="tucker-kraft-te">Tucker Kraft (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Kraft did most of his damage on a jump ball that he corralled for a 26-yard gain late in the second quarter, but he didn’t see a target after that point, leaving him below 50 receiving yards for the fifth time in the past six games. During that span, he’s mustered 15 catches for 179 yards on 21 targets, but he’s salvaged two of those performances with TD catches. In an offense that has leaned toward the run most weeks since a Week 10 bye, Kraft must take full advantage of the handful of targets that he may receive, and he’ll look to do just that Week 16 against the Saints on Monday Night Football.</p> <h4 id="jordan-love-qb">Jordan Love (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> After Josh Jacobs ran in a touchdown on the opening drive, Love doubled Green Bay’s lead with a 13-yard touchdown pass to Romeo Doubs. Love had only one incompletion as the Packers produced points on all four of their first-half drives to take a 20-3 lead into the locker room. Green Bay’s offense slowed down in the second half, but the defense did its job, and Love added some breathing room with a 22-yard touchdown pass to Romeo Doubs with 4:59 left in the fourth quarter. This clean performance improved Love’s TD:INT to 23:11 heading into a Week 16 home game against the Saints.</p> <h4 id="josh-jacobs-rb">Josh Jacobs (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Jacobs was involved from the get-go with 44 scrimmage yards on seven carries and two catches on the opening drive, which concluded with a one-yard touchdown run. He finished the first half with 17 touches for 111 yards but struggled after halftime. Jacobs went backward in the third quarter with four carries for minus-5 yards, then fumbled in the fourth. He racked up some more yardage as the Packers kept the clock running with the lead but was stuffed on fourth-and-2 with 5:55 left. Jacobs came six rushing yards shy of his fourth 100-yard rushing performance, but he’s up to 12 rushing touchdowns in 14 games with the Packers and will look to add to that total against the Saints in Week 16.</p> <h4 id="tank-dell-wr">Tank Dell (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Dell’s receiving yardage total, modest as it was, qualified as the second highest on the Texans for the afternoon behind Joe Mixon’s 33. Dell also recorded his longest rush since Week 2 with his 15-yard run, but he’s now posted under 40 receiving yards in five of his last eight games overall. Dell will look to make inroads against the Chiefs’ defense in a Week 16 road matchup on Saturday afternoon.</p> <h4 id="alec-pierce-wr">Alec Pierce (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable</p> <h4 id="patrick-mahomes-qb">Patrick Mahomes (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Mahomes was forced out of Sunday’s 21-7 win over the Browns in the fourth quarter, leaving backup Carson Wentz to close out the contest. Now, with the Chiefs facing a short turnaround for Week 16’s matchup against the Texans on Saturday, then a road matchup against Pittsburgh on Christmas Day coming Week 17, Mahomes’ availability for the remainder of the regular season is murky at best. Currently, at 13-1, Kansas City has a two-game lead on Buffalo (11-3) for the top seed in the AFC, and the Chiefs have already clinched a playoff spot. The team figures to take a cautious approach to Mahomes’ health in order to prioritize his effectiveness for the postseason, making it appear likely that Wentz starts Saturday versus Houston. For Weeks 17 and 18, though, playoff standing could potentially factor into decisions made on Mahomes’ availability.</p> <h4 id="jonnu-smith-te">Jonnu Smith (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Smith was the Dolphins’ leader in receptions and targets while checking in second in receiving yards. The veteran tight end has at least nine catches in three of his last four games, and his seven-yard touchdown grab with 4:30 remaining was Smith’s fifth score in the last five contests as well. The FIU product heads into a Week 16 home matchup against the 49ers with a career-best 70 receptions and 740 receiving yards over 14 games, while his six touchdowns are the second most of his career.</p> <h4 id="alvin-kamara-rb">Alvin Kamara (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Kamara was forced out of New Orleans’ 20-19 loss against Washington in Week 15 in the second half, and it’s possible his groin injury could impact his availability for Monday night’s road matchup against Green Bay on Dec. 23. If Kamara were to miss any time, second-year pro Kendre Miller and veteran Jamaal Williams would be positioned as the lead options in the Saints backfield. Further details on Kamara’s health may not be made available until later during Week 16 prep, with New Orleans’ first official practice scheduled to occur Thursday.</p> <h4 id="chris-olave-wr">Chris Olave (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Injured Reserve <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> In other words, the Saints aren’t shutting Olave down for the season – at least not yet – but he’s unlikely to play this Sunday against the Commanders when first eligible to return from IR. Olave sustained his second concussion of the season and his third in less than a year in the Saints’ Week 9 loss to the Panthers on Nov. 3.</p> <h4 id="aj-brown-wr">A.J. Brown (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Brown made headlines throughout the week after being critical of Philadelphia’s passing offense, but he did his part to quiet that storyline by making a season-best eight receptions while topping 100 yards for the fifth time in 11 contests. His performance was highlighted by long receptions 21, 20, 19 and 17 yards as well as a five-yard touchdown late in the first quarter. Brown’s strong performance was almost soured late in the game, when he got up slowly after an apparent hip-drop tackle, though he was spotted moving fine in the locker room following the win, per Eliot Shorr-Parks of Sports Radio 94 WIP Philadelphia.</p> <h4 id="mike-williams-wr">Mike Williams (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Playing without Pickens in Week 14 against the Browns, Williams resurfaced in the Steelers’ air attack, albeit modestly, with a 3-36-0 line on four targets. However, that represented a significant uptick in involvement for the veteran trade-deadline acquisition, whose only reception in a Steelers uniform prior to that game had been a 32-yard touchdown catch in his Week 10 team debut against the Commanders. Williams again will have added opportunities for targets Sunday, although those will come versus a talented Philadelphia secondary that’s allowed an NFC-low 178.5 passing yards per game.</p> <h4 id="jauan-jennings-wr">Jauan Jennings (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Just four days after bringing in seven of eight targets – a pair of touchdown grabs among them – against the Bears, Jennings saw a team-high target total in Thursday’s rainy conditions but was highly inefficient. The veteran wideout entered Thursday with a solid 73.1 percent catch rate on the season, and his struggles led to his lowest yardage total since Week 6. Jennings will aim to bounce back against a talented Dolphins secondary in a Week 16 road interconference battle on Sunday, Dec. 22.</p> <h4 id="jaxon-smith-njigba-wr">Jaxon Smith-Njigba (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Smith-Njigba was the lone bright spot among Seattle receivers Sunday, leading the team in every notable category by a large margin. The sophomore standout has quietly become the top wideout for a team boasting two proven veterans at the position. Smith-Njigba has generated at least 69 yards of offense over his last seven contests with four touchdowns scored over that span. Continue riding the hot hand down the stretch as the Seahawks prepare to host the Vikings next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="baker-mayfield-qb">Baker Mayfield (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Mayfield posted a stellar 135.3 passer rating en route to a lopsided victory between cross-conference playoff hopefuls. The four scores also helped the 2018 first-overall pick set a new high-water mark in touchdown passes (32) in a single season. Mayfield continues to prove that last year’s breakout with Tampa Bay was no fluke, as he is now 383 yards away from recording consecutive 4,000-yard campaigns. It would take a season-best effort against the Cowboys on Sunday Night Football in Week 16 to accomplish the feat, but the late-blooming QB makes for a strong fantasy play whether or not he hits the 4K mark in passing yards next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="austin-ekeler-rb">Austin Ekeler (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Injured Reserve <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Ekeler said he doesn’t remember walking off the field Nov. 24 against the Cowboys, or indeed anything until he got in the ambulance to go to the hospital. The veteran running back also states he had memory loss following his Week 3 concussion earlier in the season. All of these symptoms led to Ekeler’s placement on injured reserve ahead of Week 13, sidelining him until at least Week 18. Brian Robinson, Jeremy McNichols and Chris Rodriguez are set to handle backfield duties while Ekeler is out.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-height="630" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_15_2024_TOM_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-height="630" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_15_2024_TOM_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2024-25,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week15"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry></feed>
