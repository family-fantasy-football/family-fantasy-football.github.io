</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="lamar-jackson-qb">Lamar Jackson (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Doubtful <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Ravens have been mum regarding the severity of the hamstring concern that forced Jackson out in the third quarter of Sunday’s 37-20 loss to Kansas City, but the quarterback appears in line to miss his first game for injury-related reasons since 2022. According to the report, Jackson still plans to try and play through the injury this Sunday, but if he doesn’t show enough improvement during the week, Cooper Rush would direct the offense against Houston. The expected loss of Jackson would be a major hit to the 1-3 Ravens in their matchup with the Texans’ top-ranked scoring defense, which has allowed just 12.8 points per game through the first four weeks.</p> <h4 id="dillon-gabriel-qb">Dillon Gabriel (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Per Adam Schefter of ESPN, the rookie third-round pick will take over the top job from Joe Flacco, who will move into the No. 2 role, who led the Browns to a 1-3 record through the first four games of the season. Fellow rookie Shedeur Sanders, meanwhile, will remain third on the depth chart. Gabriel possesses more mobility than Flacco, who had been hit 19 times over the last two games according to Cleveland.com. The signal-caller’s ability to provide some scrambling ability could prove to be helpful behind an offensive line that’s been without both its starting tackles of late. That said, Gabriel could preside over a run-based attack headlined by rookie running back Quinshon Judkins, which could limit the quarterback’s passing volume and his overall fantasy appeal.</p> <h4 id="jameson-williams-wr">Jameson Williams (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Williams has had a slow start to the season, with Sunday’s performance marking the third time in four games that he’s logged fewer than 45 receiving yards. This showing was particularly troubling because he led the team in targets, and the Lions seemingly made an effort to get him going. Per Colton Pouncy of The Athletic, Jared Goff took responsibility for some miscues when targeting Williams, saying he made poor reads, though Williams also dropped several passes.</p> <h4 id="nico-collins-wr">Nico Collins (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Collins didn’t dominate targets in his typical fashion Sunday, as four pass catchers logged between four and six targets. He still easily paced the Texans in yardage thanks to long gains of 37 and 22 yards to account for the majority of his production. Even with an underachieving Houston offense, Collins has found a way to be productive early this season by scoring a touchdown or topping 75 receiving yards in each of his last three games.</p> <h4 id="jonathan-taylor-rb">Jonathan Taylor (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Taylor turned in an efficient day on the ground, averaging 4.5 yards per carry with two gains of more than 10 yards. He also had a 53-yard touchdown nullified by a holding penalty, which held him under 100 yards rushing for the first time since Week 1. While Taylor’s performance may have been underwhelming relative to his very high standards, his involvement as a receiver is noteworthy. He has multiple catches in every game to begin 2025, and already has 13 receptions on the season after logging no more than 19 in either of the last two years.</p> <h4 id="tre-tucker-wr">Tre Tucker (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Tucker crashed back to reality after posting a career game with three touchdowns against the Commanders in Week 3. The versatile wideout remained involved with four touches, but Geno Smith’s struggles may have contributed to Tucker’s inability to break off a big gain Sunday. With expectations back in check, Tucker should resume his role as a fantasy dart throw when the Raiders visit the Colts next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="brock-bowers-te">Brock Bowers (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Las Vegas’ passing offense was anemic Sunday, generating just 117 yards through the air compared to 240 on the ground. Bowers managed to lead all Raiders’ receiving options in receptions (five) and yardage (46), but it was RB Ashton Jeanty who benefited from both of Geno Smith’s passing scores in the loss. It’s safe to say that Bowers’ sophomore season has been a disappointment through four weeks, with the star tight end averaging 40.7 yards in the three games following his promising Week 1 performance (5-103-0), although he may still be hampered slightly by a minor knee injury he picked up in the opener. Perhaps the 1-3 Raiders will look to feature its best receiving threat more often in a road matchup against the Colts next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="jaylen-waddle-wr">Jaylen Waddle (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Waddle finished tied for second in receptions and targets and as the runner-up in receiving yards on the night, but the bigger story is the 2021 first-round pick’s projected expanded role moving forward. Tyreek Hill suffered what is being termed as a dislocated knee in the third quarter, meaning his season is almost certainly over. Consequently, Waddle, who posted a spectacular 104-1,015-6 line on 141 targets over 16 games back in his rookie 2021 campaign with Hill still on the Chiefs’ roster, should elevate to the role of Tua Tagovailoa’s top target moving forward. Waddle has yet to top five catches and 68 yards in a game this season, but it should only be a matter of time before he sets new single-game highs, perhaps as soon as a Week 5 road matchup against the Panthers.</p> <h4 id="tua-tagovailoa-qb">Tua Tagovailoa (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Tagovailoa put together a relatively tame stat line in terms of his yardage, but the 2020 first-round pick generated his third straight two-touchdown-pass tally with a pair of scoring tosses to the debuting Darren Waller. Tagovailoa did lose Tyreek Hill to a gruesome knee injury, however, so he could be challenged to consistently offer above-average fantasy production moving forward without his No. 1 target. On the bright side, Tagovailoa demonstrated encouraging chemistry with Waller in their first game together and still has other speedy playmakers at his disposal, not to mention a favorable Week 5 road matchup against the Panthers on Sunday afternoon.</p> <h4 id="jordan-addison-wr">Jordan Addison (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Seeing his first action of the season after serving a three-game suspension, Addison had a quiet first half but then turned busted coverage into an 81-yard gain late in the fourth quarter that set up a Jalen Nailor TD reception, as the Vikings tried to rally from a 21-6 deficit. Addison figures to be productive again in Week 5, facing a Browns defense in London that has been far more vulnerable through the air than on the ground to begin the year.</p> <h4 id="jordan-mason-rb">Jordan Mason (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The former 49ers wasn’t able to repeat his Week 3 breakout versus Cincinnati against a tougher front seven, and Mason’s longest run against Pittsburgh went for only nine yards. He also saw backup RB Zavier Scott catch a 16-yard TD in the fourth quarter as Minnesota tried to come back from a 21-6 deficit. Things won’t get any easier for Mason in Week 5, as he’ll take on a Browns defense in London that has already stuffed Derrick Henry and Josh Jacobs this season.</p> <h4 id="garrett-wilson-wr">Garrett Wilson (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Wilson welcomed back QB Justin Fields (concussion) with open arms after the duo connected in the end zone for the second time this season (third overall for Wilson). The star wideout scored in spectacular fashion when he caught a high-point pass through a defender’s arm while barely dragging both of his feet in bounds. He did have a second potential score erased by an offensive pass interference penalty. Wilson is now up to 311 yards and three touchdowns through four starts as the Jets continue to force feed him the ball in failed comeback attempts. Fantasy managers should treat the Ohio State product as a WR1 in another soft matchup versus the Cowboys on Sunday.</p> <h4 id="jaylen-warren-rb">Jaylen Warren (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable</p> <h4 id="calvin-austin-iii-wr">Calvin Austin III (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Austin checked out of the contest early in the fourth quarter and headed to the locker room after he appeared to land hard on the football while falling to the ground on a reception. If Austin’s day is over, he’ll finish with two catches for 13 yards on two targets to go with nine yards on two punt returns.</p> <h4 id="jauan-jennings-wr">Jauan Jennings (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Jennings previously sat out the 49ers’ Week 3 win over the Cardinals due to an ankle issue, and that injury plus a new rib concern is clouding his availability for Thursday’s game against the Rams. After being gauged as a non-participant on Monday’s estimated practice report, Jennings will be a spectator Tuesday in the 49ers’ lone on-field session this week. The 49ers will decide Wednesday whether Jennings takes a designation into the Week 5 contest, or if he’ll be ruled out in advance of the game. The San Francisco pass-catching corps could once again be shorthanded with Jennings, Ricky Pearsall (knee) and Jordan Watkins (calf) all sitting out Tuesday’s practice, while tight end George Kittle (hamstring) and Brandon Aiyuk (knee) aren’t on track to return from IR until at least Week 6.</p> <h4 id="tyjae-spears-rb">Tyjae Spears (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Injured Reserve <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Spears suffered a high-ankle sprain during the preseason and started the season on injured reserve, but he’s eligible to return to practice this week. It sounds like Spears is closing in on 100 percent health. Tony Pollard has played a whopping 89 percent of the Titans’ offensive snaps as a true every-down back through four games and has averaged 18.5 touches per contest, totaling 316 yards from scrimmage and one touchdown. Spears should take some of that work once he returns, but Pollard likely will remain the lead back in Tennessee.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_4_2025_90s_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_4_2025_90s_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week4"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Abbey’s TNT Team Week 4 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-4-ARV/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Abbey’s TNT Team Week 4 Report"/><published>2025-10-01T15:05:16+00:00</published><updated>2025-10-01T15:05:16+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-4-ARV</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-4-ARV/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Abbey’s TNT Team 🧨 Won against Michael’s Managable Team 157.57-136.89<br/> Current Standing: #4<br/> Playoff Chances: 68.2%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 91.7%<br/> Best Performer: Bo Nix (31.24 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="bijan-robinson-rb">Bijan Robinson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The 181 scrimmage yards were a career high for Robinson, as he hit the century mark in receiving yards for the second time in four games to begin the season. The third-year RB scored on a 14-yard run in the second quarter, his first TD on the ground in 2025, and he’s topped 100 combined yards in every game so far. Robinson has amassed 314 rushing yards and 274 receiving yards through four weeks, earning a well-deserved rest during Atlanta’s Week 5 bye before facing the Bills in Week 6.</p> <h4 id="xavier-legette-wr">Xavier Legette (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Legette has missed back-to-back games and was unable to practice in any capacity en route to being ruled out for Week 4, but it appears he has a better chance to return Week 5 to take on the Dolphins on Sunday, Oct. 5. Across two regular-season appearances so far, the 2024 first-round pick has secured just four of 15 targets for eight yards.</p> <h4 id="colston-loveland-te">Colston Loveland (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> After he managed just one limited practice in Week 4 prep due to a hip injury, Loveland ended up sitting out Sunday’s 25-24 win over the Raiders. The rookie first-round pick appears to be trending in the right direction, however, as he took the field for an unofficial practice Tuesday during the team’s Week 5 bye. With extra time to heal up, Loveland should be on track to return for the Bears’ Week 6 matchup with the Commanders on Oct. 13.</p> <h4 id="dylan-sampson-rb">Dylan Sampson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Browns’ backfield is securely in the hands of Quinshon Judkins, who has steadily increased his dominance since being activated in Week 2, while Jerome Ford has a tenuous hold on the No. 2 spot. Sampson has a combined 14 snaps and one target over the last two games.</p> <h4 id="jaydon-blue-rb">Jaydon Blue (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Blue has been a healthy inactive for each of Dallas’ first four games, and as long as both Javonte Williams and Miles Sanders (ankle) are healthy and producing, it’s hard to see the rookie making an impact in the box score. Blue is little more than an end-of-bench stash in deeper fantasy leagues and a hold in dynasty formats.</p> <h4 id="bo-nix-qb">Bo Nix (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Nix took full advantage of a cushy matchup and cracked the 300-yard mark in passing for the first time this season. The athletic signal-caller also punched in his first rushing touchdown of the year on a six-yard scamper in the first quarter that wound up being the game-winning score. While this was easily Nix’s best performance to date in 2025, fantasy managers may want to keep expectations in check for a road tilt against a far-more talented Philadelphia defense in Week 5.</p> <h4 id="kalif-raymond-wr">Kalif Raymond (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Raymond was able to match his season highs in catches and targets, but he was still a rather unimpactful part of what the team did on offense. The wide receiver did make his mark on special teams, returning a punt for a score in the fourth quarter, which was his first trip to the end zone in any capacity since Week 8 of the 2024 campaign. Through four games this season, Raymond has reeled in six of nine targets for 47 yards, while also compiling 60 yards on kickoff returns and 114 yards as a punt returner.</p> <h4 id="geno-smith-qb">Geno Smith (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Smith threw an interception in each of the first three quarters before the Bears mounted a comeback in the fourth. The veteran signal-caller was coming off a mistake-free, three-touchdown performance in Week 3, but a pair of three-interception outings have sandwiched that strong showing. Smith will be a risky play against a tough Indianapolis defense next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="puka-nacua-wr">Puka Nacua (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Nacua finally cashed in his first receiving touchdown of 2025, which had been the only ingredient missing from a white-hot start to the campaign. The star wideout garnered a whopping 15 targets for the second consecutive game, confirming his status as QB Matthew Stafford’s unquestioned No. 1 option even with the addition of Davante Adams this past offseason. The 24-year-old Nacua is also proving to be one of the top players in general in fantasy with 555 combined yards from scrimmage and two total touchdowns through four games, as he scored a 45-yard rushing TD in Week 2. The Rams will face a quick turnaround before hosting the 49ers in a battle of 3-1 NFC West clubs on Thursday Night Football in Week 5.</p> <h4 id="kyren-williams-rb">Kyren Williams (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Williams’ fumble early in the fourth quarter didn’t end up costing his team a shot at victory, but it put a stink on a fantasy score that didn’t feature a trip to the end zone. The fourth-year back still finished as the Rams’ leading rusher as per usual while out-touching backup Blake Corum 16 to 11 with far better efficiency. Williams has helped offset Corum’s increased usage by averaging a healthy 4.5 yards per tote. The 24-year-old Williams will continue spearheading Los Angeles’ rushing attack when the Rams host the 49ers on Thursday Night Football in Week 5.</p> <h4 id="tyreek-hill-wr">Tyreek Hill (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Out <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Hill’s agent Drew Rosenhaus indicated that the receiver’s surgery “went very well according to his doctors,” and a return to game action at the start of the 2026 season is considered a “realistic goal.” Though the 31-year-old will face the tough challenge of working his way back from a major knee injury that included an ACL repair, the fact that he seemingly avoided any nerve damage and won’t need multiple surgeries bodes well for his long-term outlook. That being said, his availability for the start of next season is far from guaranteed, and Hill may well have played his last snap as a Dolphin. He remains under contract for 2026 at a base salary of $29.9 million, but none of that money is currently guaranteed, and Miami could cut him at no cost up until the third day of the new league year in March.</p> <h4 id="tank-bigsby-rb">Tank Bigsby (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Eagles acquired Bigsby from the Jaguars after Week 1 but have yet to make him part of the offensive gameplan. He’s been used as a kick returner but hasn’t seen the field on offense in any of his three games with his new team. With Will Shipley back from an oblique injury, Bigsby is now the fourth running back on the depth chart.</p> <h4 id="cade-otton-te">Cade Otton (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The fourth-year tight end didn’t crack the stat sheet Week 3 despite playing 66 snaps, but he was back on the radar Sunday, albeit in very modest fashion. Otton once again spent the majority of the game on the field – he played 69 snaps (96 percent). However, he’s clearly taken a step back in the pecking order in new coordinator Josh Grizzard’s scheme, considering he’s mustered just a 6-34-0 line through four games despite playing every contest thus far without one of Mike Evans (hamstring) or Chris Godwin available.</p> <h4 id="emeka-egbuka-wr">Emeka Egbuka (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The rookie tied for the team lead in targets with Chris Godwin (ankle) in the veteran’s season debut, and Egbuka flashed with a 77-yard touchdown grab early in the third quarter. The 2025 first-round pick’s yardage total was also a career-high figure, and his TD was already his fourth in four NFL games. Egbuka’s target total has risen in each contest, and that trend could continue in a Week 5 road matchup against the Seahawks with Mike Evans (hamstring) expected to remain on the shelf.</p> <h4 id="calvin-ridley-wr">Calvin Ridley (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> After playing at least 86 percent of the offensive snaps during each of the Titans’ first three games, Ridley was on the field for just 54 percent against Houston. It translated into yet another disappointing box score for the 30-year-old wideout, as he finished with just two catches for 30 scoreless yards on three targets. Ridley has yet to find the end zone this season and has been held to 30 yards or fewer in three of four contests. In total, Ridley has an ugly 10-141-0 line on 24 targets. Among wide receivers with at least 10 targets this season, Ridley’s 41.7 percent catch rate is fifth worst at the position. It’s unclear if the undisclosed injury will hamper Ridley at all next Sunday against the Cardinals.</p> <h4 id="deebo-samuel-wr">Deebo Samuel (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> With Terry McLaurin (quadriceps) inactive, Samuel was the top option for Marcus Mariota and hauled in a 24-yard TD in the fourth quarter as the Commanders tried to mount a late rally. McLaurin seems unlikely to make a quick return, but the Washington passing game could get a significant boost in Week 5 if Jayden Daniels (knee) is cleared to play. Samuel will take a 22-204-2 line on 27 targets into next week’s clash with the Chargers.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_4_2025_ARV_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_4_2025_ARV_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week4"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Big Titi Energy Week 4 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-4-BTE/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Big Titi Energy Week 4 Report"/><published>2025-10-01T15:05:16+00:00</published><updated>2025-10-01T15:05:16+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-4-BTE</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-4-BTE/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Big Titi Energy Lost against Americas Team 82.52-111.53<br/> Current Standing: #12<br/> Playoff Chances: 4.0%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 77.4%<br/> Best Performer: C.J.

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="dalton-kincaid-te">Dalton Kincaid (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Kincaid made his one catch count by streaking down the right sideline for a touchdown midway through the fourth quarter. The reception and receiving yardage totals were both low-water marks for the tight end over the first four weeks, but with three touchdowns already on his 2025 ledger, he’s still rewarded fantasy managers despite the relative week-to-week uncertainty inherent in the Bills’ air attack. Kincaid next sets his sights on the Patriots’ defense, which he’ll face in a Week 5 home matchup next Sunday night.</p> <h4 id="dj-moore-wr">DJ Moore (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The 28-year-old took a back seat to Rome Odunze (4-69-1) yet again, as a changing of the guard appears to have taken place in Chicago’s receiver room. Moore still possesses a consistent role in new head coach Ben Johnson’s offense, garnering five to six targets on a weekly basis, but expectations need to be tempered even if QB Caleb Williams takes a big step forward coming out of Chicago’s upcoming Week 5 bye.</p> <h4 id="tee-higgins-wr">Tee Higgins (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Higgins led the Bengals in receiving yards, but considering Jake Browning threw for just 125 yards, it was still a very quiet night for the talented receiver. Higgins has put together an underwhelming first four games overall, as he has a 10-136-1 line on 20 targets in his first four games, including a three-catch, 33-yard effort against the Browns in Week 1, the one full game he played with Joe Burrow (IR, toe). With Browning averaging just 5.1 yards per attempt in his first two starts and Brett Rypien the only other healthy option on the QB depth chart, Higgins’ fantasy outlook remains depressed heading into a Week 5 home matchup against the Lions.</p> <h4 id="jake-browning-qb">Jake Browning (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> About the only true positive for Browning in the lopsided loss was that he managed to avoid turning the ball over against a ferocious Broncos defense. Browning took three sacks and averaged only 5.0 yards per attempt, with no Bengals pass catcher managing to exceed 32 receiving yards. Browning has completed just 63.4 percent of his passes and posted a 1:2 TD:INT over his first two full games as a starter, so it remains to be seen if head coach Zac Taylor considers a change to fellow backup Brett Rypien for a Week 5 home matchup against the Lions.</p> <h4 id="jerome-ford-rb">Jerome Ford (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Ford was on the field for a season-low 18 snaps, as Cleveland’s backfield is now topped by Quinshon Judkins, who had 21 of the 23 carries allotted to running backs. Ford still contributes as a third-down back and has been targeted multiple times in three consecutive contests, and he appears to still be slightly ahead of Dylan Sampson in the pecking order for touches.</p> <h4 id="cj-stroud-qb">C.J. Stroud (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Warren gets into the weeds, outlining the pre-snap reads, adjustments and execution of the play, but the main point is that Stroud may have found his groove in the new offense. That offense, put in place by new offensive coordinator Nick Caley, involves Stroud taking more control. It may have taken three-and-a-half games to click in, as the quarterback completed 11 of 13 attempts (eight different targets) for 144 yards while directing touchdown drives on successive possessions from late in the third quarter and into the fourth. Following an ugly 0-3 start and head coach DeMeco Ryans’ defense of Caley, Stroud’s intuition and execution of the offense may extend forward to Week 5 on the road against the Ravens.</p> <h4 id="christian-kirk-wr">Christian Kirk (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Kirk was active for a second game after missing the first two weeks of the year with a hamstring injury. He’s totaled 12 targets, more than any Houston receiver who has appeared in all four games aside from Nico Collins (31). Kirk will remain the No. 2 wideout for now, but rookie Jayden Higgins, who caught his first NFL touchdown Sunday, could push for the role as the season progresses.</p> <h4 id="jj-mccarthy-qb">J.J. McCarthy (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Doubtful <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> doubtful</p> <h4 id="demario-douglas-wr">DeMario Douglas (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> In the process, the slot receiver didn’t record a target, with Reiss noting that Douglas’ dip in playing time corresponded with Stefon Diggs’ snap share increasing Sunday. Though there will be weeks where Douglas is more involved in the offense, be it via game plan or game flow, his 5-13-1 line on 13 targets through four games has him off the fantasy lineup radar for now.</p> <h4 id="juwan-johnson-te">Juwan Johnson (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Johnson logged fewer than eight targets for the first time this season, finishing fifth on the team in this category behind wideouts Chris Olave (six), Rashid Shaheed (five) and Brandin Cooks (four) as well as running back Alvin Kamara (five). The Saints also logged more rushing attempts (34) than passing attempts (28) for the first time in 2025, as for the first time this season the team didn’t have to chase points while keeping the game within one score until midway through the fourth quarter. Johnson has been one of the top PPR tight ends this season, averaging 5.5 catches on 8.0 targets per game. He’ll look to get back on track during a Week 5 matchup versus the Giants on Sunday, Oct. 5.</p> <h4 id="breece-hall-rb">Breece Hall (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Hall bounced back from a pair of ugly outings by cracking the century mark in total yards for the second time this season. Braelon Allen (4-26-0) was nearly splitting work with the starter before exiting the game in the first half after taking a shot to his knee. The injury forced offensive coordinator Tanner Engstrand to give Hall – the Jets’ obvious top rushing option – enough touches to actually generate positive fantasy results. The 24-year-old has yet to hit pay dirt through four starts, a trend Hall will aim to buck in a tasty matchup on paper against the Cowboys on Sunday.</p> <h4 id="dallas-goedert-te">Dallas Goedert (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Goedert tied for the team lead in receptions with Saquon Barkley while setting the pace in receiving yards, and he was also on the receiving end of both of Jalen Hurts’ scoring tosses. Each of the touchdown grabs was unconventional, with Goedert first crossing the goal line on a nifty two-yard underhand pass from Hurts in the first quarter and then finding paydirt again on a second-quarter shovel pass from five yards out. Goedert is on a bit of a scoring surge with three total touchdown catches in the last two games, and he could be busy again in Week 5 at home against a Broncos team that could force Hurts to get the ball out quickly.</p> <h4 id="zach-charbonnet-rb">Zach Charbonnet (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Making his return from a one-game absence due to a foot injury, Charbonnet missed an opportunity for a two-touchdown night when his seven-yard scoring run early in the fourth quarter was nullified by a Jaxon Smith-Njigba holding call. Charbonnet had found the end zone for the second time this season on a one-yard run late in the first half, but after logging more snaps than backfield Kenneth Walker in each of the first two games of the season, the latter recorded six more carries Thursday night. Consequently, Charbonnet may continue working in more of a complementary role during a Week 5 home matchup against the Buccaneers on Sunday, Oct. 5.</p> <h4 id="kenneth-walker-iii-rb">Kenneth Walker III (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Seahawks welcomed back Zach Charbonnet from a one-game absence due to a foot injury Thursday, but Walker still saw seven more carries than his teammate while equaling his target tally. Walker had a long run of just 21 yards, so he worked hard for his yardage throughout the night and also turned in a chunk gain on his one catch. Walker now has alternated two duds on the ground with a pair of above-average yardage totals, and he’s added at least one reception in each game as well. Thursday night’s usage seems to indicate Walker might be considered the lead back over Charbonnet heading into a Week 5 home matchup against the Buccaneers on Sunday, Oct. 5.</p> <h4 id="terry-mclaurin-wr">Terry McLaurin (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> McLaurin sat out Week 4 and has yet to practice in any capacity since a quad injury forced him off the field early Week 3 versus the Raiders, but it sounds like the veteran wideout has a fair chance to return to action Week 5 against the Chargers. Quarterback Jayden Daniels (knee), meanwhile, seems a likely candidate to retake the field Sunday on the road against the Chargers. It will bode well for McLaurin if he’s able to be listed as at least a limited participant on Wednesday’s first official practice report of the week.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_4_2025_BTE_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_4_2025_BTE_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week4"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Emma’s Excellent Team Week 4 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-4-EET/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Emma’s Excellent Team Week 4 Report"/><published>2025-10-01T15:05:16+00:00</published><updated>2025-10-01T15:05:16+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-4-EET</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-4-EET/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Emma’s Excellent Team Lost against Third Time’s the Charm? 106.06-156.86<br/> Current Standing: #11<br/> Playoff Chances: 7.0%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 81.5%<br/> Best Performer: Drake London (21.00 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="trey-benson-rb">Trey Benson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Benson operated as the unquestioned lead back in the Cardinals’ first game without James Conner (IR, foot), but he finished with two fewer carries than in Sunday’s Week 3 loss to the 49ers. Benson did record a season high in receptions and outpaced No. 2 back Emari Demercado by six carries, but game script conspired to afford him almost as much pass-catching work as rushing volume. Benson should have a better opportunity to handle a larger workload during a Week 5 home matchup against an ineffective Titans defense on Sunday, Oct. 5.</p> <h4 id="drake-london-wr">Drake London (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The fourth-year wideout didn’t reach 60 receiving yards or find the end zone in the first three weeks of the season, but London broke out in Week 4, highlighting his performance with a five-yard TD reception from Michael Penix in the first quarter. London led the Falcons in targets – no one else got more than five – as well as catches and receiving yards, and he remains the unquestioned top option in the team’s passing game headed into a Week 5 bye, ahead of a tough Week 6 battle against the Bills.</p> <h4 id="justice-hill-rb">Justice Hill (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Hill opened and closed the scoring Sunday. He punched in an 11-yard touchdown grab to cap off the Ravens’ first drive, then finished things off with a 71-yard touchdown run to bring the Ravens within 17 points with under two minutes to go. In between, Hill added a few short carries and receptions as the Ravens’ offense largely floundered. It was noteworthy that Hill out-snapped Derrick Henry 32 to 21, but the Ravens trailed from the second quarter onward. The Ravens host the Texans in Week 5.</p> <h4 id="joshua-palmer-wr">Joshua Palmer (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Palmer’s playing time has dwindled in recent weeks. After playing over 62 percent of the offensive snaps in Week 1 against the Ravens, Palmer’s workload has dipped in each game since, landing at just 25 percent against New Orleans. In a Buffalo offense that likes to cycle through its receivers and tight ends throughout the course of a game, Palmer holds minimal fantasy value unless injuries crop up ahead of him on the depth chart.</p> <h4 id="courtland-sutton-wr">Courtland Sutton (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Sutton stayed hot with his second trip to the end zone in as many weeks while pacing the Broncos in receiving yards on Monday Night Football. The one-catch dud in Week 2 is proving to be an anomaly after the veteran wideout posted WR1 numbers in his three other starts this year. Expect Sutton to continue operating as QB Bo Nix’s favorite target in a road matchup against the Eagles on Sunday.</p> <h4 id="trevor-lawrence-qb">Trevor Lawrence (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Lawrence played the role of game manager Sunday, protecting the football with safe, short throws en route to Jacksonville’s third win of the season. It was still a lackluster showing from a fantasy perspective after the fifth-year pro failed to score multiple touchdowns for the third time in four starts this year. Lawrence has the Jaguars atop the AFC South, but his play does not inspire much optimism in fantasy circles heading into a tough matchup against Kansas City next Monday.</p> <h4 id="hollywood-brown-wr">Hollywood Brown (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Brown maintained a key role in the Kansas City offense even with the return of Xavier Worthy, as he was one of four pass catchers with at least five targets. He made an 18-yard grab early in the second quarter to set up a field goal, and he added a 15-yard touchdown catch early in the fourth quarter. Since an explosive Week 1 performance, Brown has not reached 50 receiving yards in a game, though he has consistently earned at least five targets.</p> <h4 id="jakobi-meyers-wr">Jakobi Meyers (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Meyers wound up leading the Raiders in targets, but the end result was a season low in receiving yards. The veteran wideout’s yardage total has decreased on a weekly basis, but he was able to buck a similar trend in targets with Sunday’s seven looks from Geno Smith. Meyers should continue providing a solid fantasy floor as the Raiders prepare to face the Colts next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="rashid-shaheed-wr">Rashid Shaheed (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Shaheed caught exactly four passes for the third week in a row. He tied for second on the Saints in targets Sunday, and he’s now logged between five and six targets in each of the last three contests. The 26-year-old speedster has just one catch over 20 yards so far this season, but his consistent target share provides a solid floor for deeper leagues in PPR formats. Shaheed will look to maintain his WR2 role behind Chris Olave during New Orleans’ next game versus the Giants on Sunday, Oct. 5.</p> <h4 id="saquon-barkley-rb">Saquon Barkley (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Barkley continued to find tough sledding on the ground against a stout Buccaneers run defense, but he managed to salvage his fantasy day with a six-yard touchdown run late in the third quarter, his third visit to the end zone this season. The reigning Offensive Player of the Year also recorded four catches for the third time in the first four contests, finishing with one of his typically robust workloads. Barkley figures to have to continue grinding for every yard on the ground Week 5, as the Broncos will pay a visit to Philadelphia next Sunday afternoon.</p> <h4 id="brock-purdy-qb">Brock Purdy (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Earlier Tuesday, 49ers general manager John Lynch classified Purdy as questionable for Thursday’s game against the Rams after the quarterback experienced renewed soreness in his previously sprained toe, which kept him out of action for two games before he started this past Sunday’s 26-21 loss to Jacksonville. With Purdy having now gone down as a non-participant on the 49ers’ first two Week 5 practice reports, the signal-caller could struggle to gain clearance ahead of Thursday’s contest. Backup Mac Jones would be in line to make his third start of the season if Purdy isn’t able to make enough progress.</p> <h4 id="tony-pollard-rb">Tony Pollard (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Pollard had moments of effectiveness, recording his first rush of at least 20 yards with a gain of 21 early in the second quarter. He also had a decent chunk run of 11 yards one quarter later to reach at least 60 rushing yards for the third time in four games this season. While Pollard has played relatively well, the Tennessee offense is so ineffective that it’s hard for any skill-position player to maintain consistent fantasy value, and the eventual return of Tyjae Spears (ankle) will likely cut into Pollard’s touch volume.</p> <h4 id="zach-ertz-te">Zach Ertz (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The 34-year-old tied Luke McCaffrey for the second-most receiving yards on the Commanders in Week 4, trailing Deebo Samuel’s 72-yard performance. Although he ranked second on the team in yards, Ertz’s performance was a little underwhelming considering two of the team’s top three wideouts, Terry McLaurin (quadriceps) and Noah Brown (groin), were sidelined Sunday. Regardless, Ertz’s target volume will likely stabilize when Jayden Daniels (knee) returns from injury, which could come in the Week 5 matchup against the Chargers.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_4_2025_EET_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_4_2025_EET_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week4"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Game of Zones - House Hamlin Week 4 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-4-HMB/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Game of Zones - House Hamlin Week 4 Report"/><published>2025-10-01T15:05:16+00:00</published><updated>2025-10-01T15:05:16+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-4-HMB</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-4-HMB/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Game of Zones: House Hamlin Lost against Rookie Mistake 135.24-156.21<br/> Current Standing: #2<br/> Playoff Chances: 70.2%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 87.3%<br/> Best Performer: Jordan Love (35.78 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="zay-flowers-wr">Zay Flowers (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Flowers made some big plays early, tallying catches of 21 and 17 yards on Baltimore’s first two possessions. The entire offense struggled after Lamar Jackson (hamstring) left the game late in the third quarter, but the wideout was able to pad his stats in garbage time with Cooper Rush targeting him five times on a drive early in the final quarter, which Flowers turned into four catches for 21 yards. While the Ravens are typically known for their run game, the passing attack has been the key to their offensive success so far this season, so Jackson’s health ahead of a Week 5 clash with the Texans could have a big impact on Flowers’ floor and ceiling.</p> <h4 id="derrick-henry-rb">Derrick Henry (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Ravens attempted only 17 rushes as a team, with Lamar Jackson accounting for six of those before he exited with a hamstring injury. That left Henry with limited volume, with four rushes in each half. He performed efficiently enough by gaining double-digit yards on two carries and one reception, but the game script ultimately held him back. Henry has had a poor start to the season with three lost fumbles in high-profile situations, and he’s now been held to 50 or fewer rushing yards in three consecutive games for the first time since 2018.</p> <h4 id="josh-allen-qb">Josh Allen (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Bills got more than they bargained for from the visiting Saints, but Allen still finished with his lowest pass-attempt total of the campaign. The reigning NFL MVP did put those throws to good use, tossing multiple touchdowns for the third time in four games by connecting with Khalil Shakir and Dalton Kincaid for scoring passes of 43 and 28 yards, respectively. Allen also took it in himself from five yards out just after the halfway point of the third quarter, already his third rush TD of the season. Allen takes an impressive 70.2 percent completion rate and 7:1 TD:INT into a Week 5 divisional home clash against the Patriots next Sunday night.</p> <h4 id="sam-laporta-te">Sam LaPorta (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> LaPorta remained a top priority in the Detroit offense – he finished third on the team in targets behind only Amon-Ra St. Brown (seven) and Jameson Williams (eight) – but he turned in another underwhelming performance. Despite logging a reception of 27 yards just before halftime, he now has less than 40 receiving yards in three of four games this season. LaPorta has also yet to score, with St. Brown and Jahmyr Gibbs instead dominating touches near the end zone.</p> <h4 id="amon-ra-st-brown-wr">Amon-Ra St. Brown (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> St. Brown was the only Detroit pass catcher to post a notable line in Sunday’s blowout win, accounting for seven of Jared Goff’s 16 completions. He helped set up the team’s first touchdown of the day with a 25-yard catch before turning in a pair of his own scores from two and eight yards away. St. Brown now has six touchdowns across four games while recording at least 70 receiving yards in each of his last three contests.</p> <h4 id="tucker-kraft-te">Tucker Kraft (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Kraft was one of four Packers pass catchers to record at least 50 yards, and he finished third on the team in targets. His biggest impact came on Green Bay’s opening possession, when he recorded two receptions for 22 yards and was tackled just short of the goal line. Kraft has at least four targets in all four games this season and has at least 50 receiving yards or a touchdown in three of four contests.</p> <h4 id="jordan-love-qb">Jordan Love (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Love has been efficient all season, and that didn’t change Sunday night as he averaged 7.8 yards per attempt while completing four passes of more than 20 yards. The Packers were also pushed offensively by Dak Prescott and the Cowboys, with Love attempting at least 40 passes for only the sixth time in a regular-season contest in his career. Love targeted seven pass catchers at least three times, though he connected with Romeo Doubs for all three of his touchdowns and hit Matthew Golden for a 46-yard gain – his longest of the night. Love has had mediocre fantasy results to begin the season, but he has multiple touchdown passes in three of four contests while topping 250 passing yards twice.</p> <h4 id="juju-smith-schuster-wr">JuJu Smith-Schuster (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The veteran wideout’s workload is set to decline in a couple weeks when Rashee Rice returns from his six-game suspension, but Smith-Schuster continues to play a key role in the offense for KC in the meantime, as he led the wideout room with 57 offensive snaps (78 percent) in Week 4. Sunday’s effort marked the first time he’s reached double-digit PPR points this season, and he’ll likely remain a touchdown-dependent fantasy option while in a prominent role. That said, he has a decent matchup ahead versus the Jaguars in Week 5.</p> <h4 id="kareem-hunt-rb">Kareem Hunt (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Hunt had split the rushing workload almost exactly evenly with Isiah Pacheco through the first three games of the season, and while the veteran saw 14 touches compared to Pacheco’s nine Sunday, their snap count was nearly even (32 for Hunt to 27 for Pacheco). However, Hunt had a poor day by averaging only 2.6 yards per carry, with a long gain of seven yards. He appears to have the trust of the coaching staff, which could insulate his role, but he has yet to reach 35 rushing yards in a game this season.</p> <h4 id="keenan-allen-wr">Keenan Allen (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The veteran wideout failed to haul in at least 60 yards for the first time this season and saw his TD streak end at three games, but Allen still racked up at least five receptions for the fourth straight week to begin his reunion with the Chargers. He’ll take a 24-231-3 line on 35 targets into Week 5’s clash with a vulnerable Commanders secondary.</p> <h4 id="blake-corum-rb">Blake Corum (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Kyren Williams handled the bulk of backfield touches for Los Angeles as per usual, finishing with 94 yards from scrimmage on 16 touches. Corum still saw strong touch volume, but he failed to produce much with his opportunities. The nine carries marked a new high for the Michigan product through four games in 2025, but Corum doesn’t provide enough upside in his current backup role to warrant starting consideration against the 49ers on Thursday.</p> <h4 id="kenneth-gainwell-rb">Kenneth Gainwell (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Jaylen Warren (knee) was surprisingly inactive Sunday morning, leaving Gainwell to fill in as Pittsburgh’s lead back. He did so admirably, scoring touchdowns from one and four yards away while also ripping off long gains of 15 and 10 yards. Gainwell also remained active as a pass catcher, giving him a well-rounded fantasy line. The Steelers are headed into their bye week, meaning this may be Gainwell’s only chance to handle this type of workload for the time being, but he proved plenty capable of handling the lead-back role if needed.</p> <h4 id="sterling-shepard-wr">Sterling Shepard (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The veteran wideout continued to operate the No. 3 receiver, as Chris Godwin’s season debut was offset by Mike Evans’ absence due to a hamstring injury. Shepard saw a significant downturn from his season-high 80-yard output in Week 3, but given his chemistry with Baker Mayfield, he could be more productive in a Week 5 road matchup against the Seahawks.</p> <h4 id="cam-ward-qb">Cam Ward (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Ward continues to look overwhelmed during his rookie season, as he was unable to lead the Titans on a scoring drive while averaging an abysmal 4.2 yards per attempt in Sunday’s blowout loss. He did manage multiple completions of at least 20 yards for the third consecutive game, but Ward has only two touchdowns with four turnovers across his first four games as a pro. It’s too early to make any conclusions about Ward’s ability as a pro, but it has not been a good start to his career.</p> <h4 id="jacory-croskey-merritt-rb">Jacory Croskey-Merritt (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The rookie running back led the Commanders’ backfield in touches on the day with nine, but Chris Rodriguez paced the team in rushing yards, turning seven totes into 59 yards, while Deebo Samuel got three carries in addition to his receiving work and Jeremy McNichols also chipped in with three touches. The overall effectiveness of the arrangement – 6.7 yards per carry for Washington’s backfield as a whole – was impressive once again, but none of the team’s RBs will be reliable fantasy plays without a consistent path to more volume. Croskey-Merritt will try to make an impact with what touches he gets in Week 5 against the Chargers.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_4_2025_HMB_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_4_2025_HMB_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week4"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Mama Daughter Duo Week 4 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-4-JST/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mama Daughter Duo Week 4 Report"/><published>2025-10-01T15:05:16+00:00</published><updated>2025-10-01T15:05:16+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-4-JST</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-4-JST/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Mama Daughter Duo Lost against To Infinity and Bijan! 123.73-137.55<br/> Current Standing: #6<br/> Playoff Chances: 52.2%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 89.3%<br/> Best Performer: Christian McCaffrey (23.10 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="michael-penix-jr-qb">Michael Penix Jr. (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> After a rough Week 3 performance on the road in Carolina, Penix returned home in Week 4 and looked much more composed, topping his prior career high in yardage by one as he delivered his first multi-TD effort of 2025. The second-year QB hit Drake London for a five-yard score in the first quarter and Kyle Pitts for a seven-yard touchdown in the third, while both London and Bijan Robinson eclipsed the century mark in receiving yards, during a game in which Atlanta never trailed. Penix will get a week off for the Falcons’ bye before facing a tough test in Week 6 against the Bills.</p> <h4 id="jalen-coker-wr">Jalen Coker (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Injured Reserve <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> It sounds like Coker won’t be ready to return from injured reserve when first eligible in Week 5. He was expected to miss four-to-six games all along, with his return likely to come at some point in October. With the Panthers not getting much from their pass catchers so far, Coker should push for a starting job before mid-season.</p> <h4 id="dandre-swift-rb">D’Andre Swift (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Swift was limited during the practice week with a hip injury that had him listed as questionable leading up to Sunday’s kickoff. The veteran RB suited up and rewarded fantasy managers with his second trip to the end zone in four games this season. The Bears placed no restrictions on Swift, handing him 14 of its 18 running back carries in the win. He has been generating just enough value on a weekly basis to warrant flex consideration in most formats, but he won’t be available in Week 5 with the Bears on a bye, making Week 6 the next time Swift will be in action.</p> <h4 id="caleb-williams-qb">Caleb Williams (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Williams also put two balls on the ground, but he was fortunately able to recover both of his fumbles. The sophomore QB was coming off his best game of the season against the Cowboys, but he reverted to inconsistent form Sunday. We have seen flashes of brilliance from Williams in new head coach Ben Johnson’s scheme, but he still isn’t polished enough to be relied upon regularly. With the Bears entering their bye, Williams’ next action will come in Week 6 on Oct. 13 against the Commanders on Monday Night Football.</p> <h4 id="rome-odunze-wr">Rome Odunze (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Odunze’s scoring onslaught continued when he gutted the Raiders’ secondary for a 27-yard touchdown on Chicago’s first possession of the second half. The breakout fantasy star has generated five touchdowns during his impressive four-game scoring streak to kick off the season. Odunze’s eight targets Sunday were on par with his 8.8 average through four weeks, giving fantasy managers a reliable WR1 asset so far. The talented sophomore will attempt to extend his scoring streak when the Bears resume play against the Commanders in Week 6 on Oct. 13 following the team’s upcoming bye.</p> <h4 id="travis-kelce-te">Travis Kelce (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Patrick Mahomes spread the ball around relatively evenly in the Kansas City offense, with Kelce being one of three players earning either five or six targets. The veteran tight end finished second on the team in yardage, logging long receptions of 15 and 12 yards. Though Kelce is no longer an elite fantasy option, he still has at least four receptions in each of his last three games while also topping 45 yards in three of four contests this year.</p> <h4 id="hunter-henry-te">Hunter Henry (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The veteran tight end continued to flash encouraging chemistry with Drake Maye, getting into the end zone for the third time in the last two games on a 31-yard catch to cap off the first drive of the second half. Henry’s reception and target totals have fluctuated considerably week to week, but a Week 5 road battle against the Bills next Sunday night could well turn out to be one of his busier games considering New England figures to have to remain aggressive on offense.</p> <h4 id="chris-olave-wr">Chris Olave (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Olave logged his first touchdown of the season with a three-yard scoring grab in the third quarter. This was the silver lining, as he posted season lows in catches, targets and yards, while the Saints had more rushing attempts (34) than passing attempts (28) for the first time this season. Olave also threw an interception on his first career passing attempt. The fifth-year wideout tried to hit quarterback Spencer Rattler on a Philly Special-style trick play in the red zone, but the Bills sniffed out the play and picked it off to end the second quarter. Olave has shown good PPR value through four weeks, averaging 6.5 catches on 10.5 targets per game, but he’s yet to record over 57 receiving yards in any contest. He’ll look to record double-digit targets for the fourth time this season during New Orleans’ next game versus the Giants on Sunday, Oct. 5.</p> <h4 id="will-shipley-rb">Will Shipley (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> It was good to see Shipley back on the field, but his role was almost exclusively limited to special teams, where he featured as a kick returner. He played just three offensive snaps and did not receive a carry nor catch a pass, though he was targeted once.</p> <h4 id="devonta-smith-wr">DeVonta Smith (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Smith had the Eagles’ second-longest gain through the air of the afternoon with a 20-yard reception, but his production stalled during another very quiet day for the air attack. The 2021 first-round pick has multiple receptions in every game thus far, but after clearing the 50-yard threshold in the previous two contests, Smith mustered his second-lowest yardage total of the campaign Sunday. He could be hard-pressed to improve much on his relatively modest 17-158-1 line in Week 5, as a stingy Broncos secondary pays a visit to the defending champions.</p> <h4 id="jalen-hurts-qb">Jalen Hurts (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Eagles’ air attack was back to low-volume mode Sunday, despite the Buccaneers eventually making matters interesting in the second half. Hurts had his share of misfires against an aggressive Tampa Bay defense, but he connected on two nifty touchdown passes to Dallas Goedert at the shadow of the goal line and also mustered a team- and co-season-high rushing yardage total. After not throwing a touchdown pass in either of the first two games of the season, Hurts has bounced back to toss five in the last pair of contests, and he’s yet to throw an interception despite a couple of close calls Sunday. Hurts will take on the unenviable task of facing the Broncos defense when Denver pays a visit next Sunday afternoon for a Week 5 interconference showdown.</p> <h4 id="kaleb-johnson-rb">Kaleb Johnson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Jaylen Warren’s (knee) absence opened up a lot of opportunity in the Pittsburgh backfield. Kenneth Gainwell was the primary back and performed well, though Johnson did see the most significant opportunity of his rookie season. He was servicable in the role, picking up 14 yards on the ground on a drive early in the fourth quarter to help the Steelers to a field goal. Johnson isn’t likely to see much of a role when Pittsburgh returns to the field in Week 6, but it was a small step forward after a poor start to his rookie campaign.</p> <h4 id="dk-metcalf-wr">DK Metcalf (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Metcalf found the end zone in his third straight game while also tallying his first 100-yard receiving game as a Steeler. He did the majority of his damage on an 80-yard touchdown early in the second quarter, which came nearly entirely after the catch. Metcalf continues to be Aaron Rodgers’ favorite target among the downfield pass catchers, and he has at least 80 receiving yards in half of his four games in his nascent Steelers tenure.</p> <h4 id="christian-mccaffrey-rb">Christian McCaffrey (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> McCaffrey stuck to the script that has been unfolding for him through four weeks, with another monster receiving effort that helped mask inefficient rushing totals. The 29-year-old is averaging a career worst 3.3 yards per carry with no rushing touchdowns through four games. Nearly all of his production has come through the air (31-305-2 on a massive 43 targets), but the total package is still elite from a fantasy perspective. CMC is averaging 26.3 combined touches in four starts this season, giving him an extremely high floor heading into Thursday’s tilt against the Rams.</p> <h4 id="rachaad-white-rb">Rachaad White (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Game script dictated the Buccaneers take a pass-heavy approach for significant portions of the afternoon, but White still logged a typical complementary workload on the ground. The fact Tampa Bay was trailing throughout the contest also afforded him his fair share of work as a pass catcher, leading to season-high figures in receptions and receiving yards. The veteran back figures to profile in a similar fashion during a challenging Week 5 road matchup against the Seahawks on Sunday.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_4_2025_JST_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_4_2025_JST_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week4"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Mcconky Donkeys Week 4 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-4-KTT/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mcconky Donkeys Week 4 Report"/><published>2025-10-01T15:05:16+00:00</published><updated>2025-10-01T15:05:16+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-4-KTT</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-4-KTT/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Mcconky Donkeys Lost against 90s MonCon 86.76-115.91<br/> Current Standing: #9<br/> Playoff Chances: 34.1%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 86.2%<br/> Best Performer: Aaron Rodgers (19.80 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="tyler-allgeier-rb">Tyler Allgeier (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Bijan Robinson had a massive day with 21 touches, a career-high 181 scrimmage yards and a rushing TD of his own, but Allgeier still made an impact with a 15-yard score late in the third quarter. It was the fourth-year RB’s second touchdown of the season, and despite his backup role he’s been able to carve out some fantasy value behind Robinson, turning 41 carries through four weeks into 155 rushing yards. The Falcons will be on bye in Week 5, but Allgeier’s volume in Week 6 could depend on whether the team can keep things close against the Bills.</p> <h4 id="troy-franklin-wr">Troy Franklin (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Franklin rebounded from last week’s stinker (2-8-0) with his second-highest yardage total through four games. The 22-year-old’s eight targets paced Denver’s receiving corps, but drops were an issue after finishing with a 50 percent catch rate. Franklin has flashed upside with a 18-196-1 line as a second-year pro, but his Week 5 fantasy value should be limited to deeper formats against the Eagles on Sunday.</p> <h4 id="evan-engram-te">Evan Engram (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> A back issue prevented Engram from practicing and playing in Week 3, but following full practices both Thursday and Friday, the tight end is poised to return to action Monday night against the Bengals. With just four catches (on six targets) for 33 yards in his first two games with the Broncos, the early returns on Engram aren’t great, but assuming his back injury is no longer an issue, he’s a player capable of picking up the pace, as soon as Monday. With that in mind, Zac Stevens of TheDNVR.com relays that Engram indicated Friday that he feels “great” ahead of Week 4 action, while, for his part, offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi told Stevens that he believes Engram will “be getting going here real soon.”</p> <h4 id="joe-mixon-rb">Joe Mixon (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Out <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The veteran back can be activated as soon as Week 5, but Texans head coach DeMeco Ryans was asked twice during Monday’s session with reporters and declined to provide any kind of estimated return date for Mixon, per Jonathan M. Alexander of the Houston Chronicle. While there’s no official word, it doesn’t appear he is close to returning. In the meantime, Woody Marks, fresh off a breakout performance in Week 4, and Nick Chubb will continue to share the bulk of the backfield work.</p> <h4 id="brian-thomas-jr-wr">Brian Thomas Jr. (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Thomas finished as the Jaguars’ leading receiver in another low-volume passing day from Trevor Lawrence (21-for-31, 174 yards, one TD). The 22-year-old wideout gained seven yards on his second rushing attempt of the season, but he was unable to reproduce the trip to the end zone from his first attempt back in Week 1. The positive takeaway from this matchup was Thomas posting his first catch rate north of 50 percent (71.4) after suffering a bad case of the drops over his previous three contests. Thomas will attempt to carry over the confidence from this solid showing into next Monday’s primetime matchup against Kansas City.</p> <h4 id="isiah-pacheco-rb">Isiah Pacheco (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Kareem Hunt saw more volume in the game with 14 touches, though he averaged an abysmal 2.6 yards per attempt and played 32 snaps on offense to Pacheco’s 27. Pacheco was more efficient, logging a long run of 12 yards while also finding the end zone for the first time in 2025 with an eight-yard touchdown catch late in the second quarter. Pacheco will be difficult to trust so long as he’s splitting opportunities with Hunt, but he’s showcased improved efficiency and volume in the last two games.</p> <h4 id="ladd-mcconkey-wr">Ladd McConkey (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Justin Herbert had his worst game of the season to date, but Quentin Johnston (8-98-1 on 13 targets) still put together a strong performance while Keenan Allen (5-37-0 on seven targets) maintained a solid floor. McConkey, on the other hand, failed to catch multiple passes in a game for the first time in his career. The 2024 second-round pick showed too much chemistry with Herbert as a rookie to think he’s suddenly going to disappear from the Chargers’ game plan, but McConkey will be tough to have active in most fantasy formats until he begins to show the same kind of spark he did last year. He’ll look to begin a breakout Week 5 against the Commanders.</p> <h4 id="devon-achane-rb">De’Von Achane (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Achane rattled off several chunk gains against the Jets defense, particularly on a key fourth-quarter drive as the Dolphins looked to ice their first victory of the season. The speedy third-year back’s carry and yardage totals were both season-high figures, as the combination of Tyreek Hill’s early exit due to a gruesome knee injury and a game script favorable to the ground game helped Achane’s cause. With Hill presumably sidelined the rest of the season, Achane will be looked at to provide some of the explosive component lost by the wide receiver’s absence, especially since the former is also a very capable pass catcher. Achane draws a highly favorable matchup Week 5, as the Dolphins travel to Carolina to face the Panthers.</p> <h4 id="wandale-robinson-wr">Wan’Dale Robinson (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The five targets tied for the team lead with tight end Theo Johnson, but it was still disappointing volume for Robinson in Jaxson Dart’s first career NFL start under center, especially considering that Malik Nabers (knee) was knocked out of the game in the second quarter. Nabers could have a torn ACL which would sideline him for the remainder of 2025, a brutal blow to the Giants offense that would leave Robinson and Darius Slayton atop the depth chart at WR. Robinson will take an 18-237-1 line on 27 targets into a Week 5 clash with the Saints, but the bulk of that production came Week 2 with Russell Wilson at the helm of the offense.</p> <h4 id="darius-slayton-wr">Darius Slayton (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> While the volume and production were modest, Slayton wound up leading the Giants in receptions and receiving yards in Jaxson Dart’s first career start at QB, as Malik Nabers (knee) was knocked out of the game in the second quarter. Nabers’ injury is feared to be a torn ACL which would end his season, a development that would make Slayton the team’s top downfield option, albeit in arguably the weakest wide receiver group in the league. The veteran WR will take a 9-135-0 line on 13 targets into a Week 5 contest against the Saints.</p> <h4 id="aaron-rodgers-qb">Aaron Rodgers (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Steelers played from ahead for most of the game, so Rodgers attempted only eight passes in the second half. He managed to move the offense efficiently when asked, however, with the key to his day being an explosive 80-yard touchdown to DK Metcalf early in the second quarter. This was a return to form for Rodgers, as he had only a 3:3 TD:INT while combining to throw for 332 yards across his last two games. Pittsburgh is likely to continue to rely on its run game and short passes to move the offense, which will lead to inconsistent fantasy results for Rodgers.</p> <h4 id="mike-evans-wr">Mike Evans (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Out <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> out</p> <h4 id="baker-mayfield-qb">Baker Mayfield (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Mayfield got limited throwing work in practice this week due to a biceps issue, but he still mustered his best passing yardage total of 2025, thanks in large part to 77- and 72-yard touchdown passes to Emeka Egbuka and Bucky Irving, respectively. Considering he was playing without Mike Evans (hamstring) and that Chris Godwin was making his season debut, Mayfield’s numbers have to be considered encouraging. He’ll aim to get the Bucs right back into the win column during a tough Week 5 road matchup against the Seahawks next Sunday afternoon.</p> <h4 id="tyler-lockett-wr">Tyler Lockett (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> There were some positives to take away from the performance, as Lockett logged a season-high 74 percent of offensive snaps and drew four targets for the second consecutive game. However, he was unable to connect with Cam Ward, who has struggled in his first four starts as a pro. Like nearly every Titans’ pass catcher, Lockett is an unreliable fantasy option.</p> <h4 id="jayden-daniels-qb">Jayden Daniels (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_4_2025_KTT_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_4_2025_KTT_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week4"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Michael’s Managable Team Week 4 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-4-MMT/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Michael’s Managable Team Week 4 Report"/><published>2025-10-01T15:05:16+00:00</published><updated>2025-10-01T15:05:16+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-4-MMT</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-4-MMT/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Michael’s Managable Team Lost against Abbey’s TNT Team 136.89-157.57<br/> Current Standing: #3<br/> Playoff Chances: 79.5%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 83.2%<br/> Best Performer: Drake Maye (31.22 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="khalil-shakir-wr">Khalil Shakir (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Most of Shakir’s production came on a 43-yard touchdown in the first quarter, as he put his YAC ability on full display and broke multiple tackles on a reception initially made behind the line of scrimmage. He played a season-low 29 offensive snaps versus New Orleans, but game script may have been a factor in his reduced workload. Shakir has scored in back-to-back weeks and is one of the top targets for Josh Allen in a Bills offense that has piled up 30-plus points in all four regular-season games so far. He’ll look to keep up his momentum at home against the division-rival Patriots in Week 5 on Sunday, Oct. 5.</p> <h4 id="jake-ferguson-te">Jake Ferguson (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Ferguson’s perfect day at the office was highlighted by the tight end’s first receiving touchdown of the season. The 26-year-old failed to sniff the 13 targets he averaged over his last two starts, but the increase efficiency coupled with a trip to the end zone resulted in his best standard fantasy score to date. Ferguson should continue operating as the Cowboys’ No. 2 receiving option behind George Pickens for as long as CeeDee Lamb (ankle) remains sidelined – a scenario that could repeat itself in a Week 5 matchup against the Jets next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="george-pickens-wr">George Pickens (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Pickens had a breakout night as a member of the Cowboys, generating his first 100-yard and multi-touchdown performance with the club. The 24-year-old wideout led Dallas in targets, receptions and receiving production while taking over as Dak Prescott’s top downfield option in the absence of CeeDee Lamb (ankle). Expect Pickens to continue garnering the lion’s share of Prescott’s attention as the Cowboys prepare to face the Jets next Sunday, although Sauce Gardner may have something to say about his final line.</p> <h4 id="jahmyr-gibbs-rb">Jahmyr Gibbs (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Gibbs found the end zone early in the contest, ripping off an eight-yard score with three minutes remaining in the first quarter. He also chipped in two rushes of more than 20 yards in the second and third quarters to top 90 rushing yards for the second time in four games this season. With Detroit up by multiple scores for the entire second half, Gibbs saw limited opportunity as a receiver, the only downside to his box score Sunday. He now has four total touchdowns in as many games to begin the campaign, while also topping 90 yards from scrimmage in each of the last three games.</p> <h4 id="woody-marks-rb">Woody Marks (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> After touching the ball a combined 14 times across the Texans’ first three games of the season, Marks set season highs in offensive snap share (56 percent), touches (21) and total yards (119) against Tennessee. He also scored a pair of touchdowns in the second half to help salt the game away. Additionally, Marks held up well in pass protection. Marks is shaping up as the leader of the Houston backfield moving forward and should be a priority pickup in fantasy leagues where he’s available. Nick Chubb is averaging 4.0 yards per carry on his 47 rushing attempts this season and has done nothing to lose his job, but Marks is noticeably more explosive with the ball in his hands at this stage of his career.</p> <h4 id="michael-pittman-jr-wr">Michael Pittman Jr. (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Pittman saw a season high in targets, which also marked the first time a Colts’ pass catcher commanded double-digit targets on the campaign. He managed a modest yardage total, though he did record his third touchdown of the season on a two-yard catch early in the fourth quarter. Pittman isn’t likely to deliver many huge performances given the competition for looks from Daniel Jones, but he has a minimum of four catches and 40 yards in each of his first four contests with his new QB.</p> <h4 id="daniel-jones-qb">Daniel Jones (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Jones continued to operate the Colts’ offense efficiently, averaging 7.9 yards per attempt with three completions of more than 20 yards. He also appeared to have found Adonai Mitchell for a second touchdown on a 76-yard connection, but the wideout fumbled the ball through the end zone for a touchback. Jones made some mistakes of his own, throwing two interceptions on underthrown deep passes – the latter of which came late as the Colts were trying to tie the game. Jones has passed for at least 250 yards in three of four games this season, though he has only one score in consecutive contests.</p> <h4 id="bhayshul-tuten-rb">Bhayshul Tuten (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The 23-year-old rookie took a back seat to Travis Etienne, who cracked the century mark in rushing yards while cashing in a long touchdown. Tuten will find it hard to generate consistent production so long as he is limited to a handful of carries, as he has been early in the campaign. The 2025 fourth-round pick may need an Etienne injury to warrant fantasy consideration heading into a Week 5 matchup against Kansas City next Monday.</p> <h4 id="tre-harris-wr">Tre’ Harris (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Harris played just 12 offensive snaps as the lethargic Chargers offense relied on multiple tight ends to slow New York’s pass rush. The imminent loss of Joe Alt (ankle) could mean Harris sees even less time on the field for the foreseeable future with the team intent on keeping Justin Herbert upright.</p> <h4 id="justin-herbert-qb">Justin Herbert (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The 27-year-old quarterback committed multiple turnovers for the first time in 2025 while throwing for a season low in passing yards as the Chargers took their first loss, but Herbert did salvage his day to some extent with a 36-yard TD to Quentin Johnston late in the second quarter. Herbert still has a respectable 7:3 TD:INT through four games heading into a Week 5 tilt against a Commanders defense that just gave up career-best numbers to the Falcons’ Michael Penix.</p> <h4 id="davante-adams-wr">Davante Adams (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Adams got in a limited practice Friday and overcame a questionable tag from a hamstring injury in order to suit up for Sunday’s tilt, and the veteran superstar cashed in his third receiving touchdown in as many weeks in the waning moments of the first half. Puka Nacua (13-170-1) stole the show offensively, but Adams has been producing strong numbers operating as the No. 2 option for the Rams this season. The 32-year-old will carry a 17-269-3 receiving line into Thursday’s home matchup against the 49ers in Week 5.</p> <h4 id="tj-hockenson-te">T.J. Hockenson (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Hockenson wasn’t targeted until just before halftime and didn’t make his first catch until the Vikings’ first drive of the fourth quarter. However, he saw plenty of opportunity in short areas of the field in the final 10 minutes of the game as Minnesota attempted to rally from a two-score deficit. Though Hockenson ended up with a respectable line on five targets, Jordan Addison’s return predictably appears to have cut into his target volume.</p> <h4 id="drake-maye-qb">Drake Maye (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Maye’s ultra-efficient stat line underscored New England’s all-around dominance on the afternoon, and he didn’t need to do much as a passer in the second half after the Patriots took a 28-6 lead into halftime. The second-year signal-caller connected with seven different targets while hitting Hunter Henry and Mack Hollins for scores. Maye added his second rushing touchdown of the campaign on a five-yard run to open the second quarter, and he’ll look to extend his streak of games with multiple TD passes to four when New England visits Buffalo for a Week 5 road showdown next Sunday night.</p> <h4 id="alvin-kamara-rb">Alvin Kamara (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Kamara had his second-most productive rushing output of the season and averaged over 4.2 yards per carry for the second time this year. The 30-year-old had been shouldering the bulk of the rushing workload with 50 of the team’s 79 carries over the first three games, but RB2 Kendre Miller closed the gap with a season-high 11 rushing attempts for 65 yards Sunday. This may have been part of the Saints’ offensive gameplan, as the team logged more rushing attempts (34) than passing attempts (28) for the first time this season. Kamara will look to record his first 100-yard rushing performance of the season next week, facing a Giants defense that’s allowed a league-worst 6.1 yards per carry through four weeks.</p> <h4 id="ricky-pearsall-wr">Ricky Pearsall (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The second-year wideout is one of three 49ers receivers who won’t practice Tuesday, with Jauan Jennings (ankle/ribs) and Jordan Watkins (calf) also scheduled to sit out. Pearsall’s absence comes after general manager John Lynch suggested that he’s being viewed as questionable for Thursday’s game against the Rams. The 49ers will wait and see how Pearsall is feeling Wednesday before determining whether he’ll take a designation into Thursday’s contest, or if he’ll end up being ruled out a day in advance. Pearsall was limited to season lows in receiving yards (46) and snaps (37) in this past Sunday’s 26-21 loss to the Jaguars after exiting the game with what Shanahan described as a minor PCL injury.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_4_2025_MMT_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_4_2025_MMT_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week4"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Americas Team Week 4 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-4-RRT/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Americas Team Week 4 Report"/><published>2025-10-01T15:05:16+00:00</published><updated>2025-10-01T15:05:16+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-4-RRT</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-4-RRT/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Americas Team Won against Big Titi Energy 111.53-82.52<br/> Current Standing: #10<br/> Playoff Chances: 26.8%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 89.5%<br/> Best Performer: Matthew Stafford (35.90 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="trey-mcbride-te">Trey McBride (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> McBride led the Cardinals in receptions and targets while finishing second to Marvin Harrison in receiving yards. The star tight end has topped out at a relatively modest 78 receiving yards over the first four games, but he hasn’t recorded less than five catches or logged fewer than seven targets in any contest. McBride’s production has been arguably capped to an extent by Kyler Murray’s uneven play under center, yet the former could have a good opportunity for his first breakout game of 2025 when Arizona hosts the struggling Titans in a Week 5 interconference clash on Sunday, Oct. 5.</p> <h4 id="deandre-hopkins-wr">DeAndre Hopkins (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Hopkins was a complete non-factor Sunday, failing to record a single catch while playing just 18 of the Ravens’ 54 offensive snaps. The veteran wideout’s one target was his lowest mark of the season after seeing two targets in each of the first three games. Hopkins is not seeing enough consistent usage to be relied upon for fantasy purposes. The 33-year-old should not be trusted in lineups heading into a Week 5 matchup against the Texans.</p> <h4 id="chuba-hubbard-rb">Chuba Hubbard (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Hubbard’s rushing opportunities were unsurprisingly limited in the lopsided loss, but he made good use of them on his way to a team-high yardage total on the ground. The fifth-year pro’s carry total tied for his lowest of the season, and he’s now posted multiple receptions in all four contests to date in 2025. Hubbard should have a better chance at more rushing volume in a Week 5 home matchup against the Dolphins next Sunday afternoon, a game Miami’s suspect defense will play on a short week.</p> <h4 id="jamarr-chase-wr">Ja’Marr Chase (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Chase led the Bengals in receptions, but on a night when Jake Browning threw for only 125 yards, that slotting didn’t come close to leading to any meaningful fantasy production. Chase has recorded 10 receptions in his first two full games with Browning as his quarterback, but he’s averaging only 7.3 yards per reception in that span, with only one of those catches going for 20-plus yards. If Browning remains under center for a Week 5 home matchup against the Lions, Chase will be hard to trust against a talented Detroit defense irrespective of his upside.</p> <h4 id="david-montgomery-rb">David Montgomery (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The game script set up well for Montgomery, as the Lions led by multiple scores for nearly the entire second half. However, Jahmyr Gibbs out-touched him 17-9, and Montgomery was stymied even when he did get opportunities. His longest rush went for only four yards, and he failed to reach 20 rushing yards for only the third time in his 32 games with the Lions.</p> <h4 id="dalton-schultz-te">Dalton Schultz (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Schultz tied for the team lead in targets with Nico Collins, though he was used entirely in short areas of the field. The tight end’s longest reception went for only nine yards, and he has yet to record a 20-yard gain on any of his 16 catches this season. Schultz has also yet to reach 40 receiving yards in a game.</p> <h4 id="josh-downs-wr">Josh Downs (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Downs was third among receivers/tight ends for targets after Michael Pittman (10) and Tyler Warren (six). Warren has become a focus in the intermediate passing game, which may limit Downs’ upside.</p> <h4 id="travis-etienne-jr-rb">Travis Etienne Jr. (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Etienne produced his finest fantasy score of the season after gashing the 49ers’ defense for a 48-yard touchdown on the first play following a turnover at the start of the second quarter. The 26-year-old did not let up from there, taking 19 of the 23 carries the Jaguars allotted to running backs for his second 100-plus yard rushing game of the season. After falling out of favor in 2024, Etienne has reclaimed the Jaguars’ starting job under new head coach Liam Coen on efficiency (6.1 YPC) we haven’t seen since his impressive rookie campaign in 2021. Jacksonville faces a tough Kansas City defense on Monday Night Football in Week 5, but Etienne’s early success this season makes him a must-start asset.</p> <h4 id="matthew-stafford-qb">Matthew Stafford (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Stafford pulled a vintage performance out of his bag of tricks Sunday, producing a stat line we haven’t seen regularly since his prime years in Detroit. The Rams’ offense hit the skids in the second half, resulting in a five-drive stretch that produced four consecutive three-and-outs followed by a Kyren Williams’ fumble. That’s when Stafford took it upon himself to lead an 11-play, 90-yard touchdown drive, immediately following it up with an 88-yard huge play to Tutu Atwell on the ensuing possession to seal the win for Los Angeles. The 37-year-old is proving that he still has plenty left in the tank by throwing for 1,114 yards and eight touchdowns to two interceptions through four starts in 2025. Up next for Stafford is a home matchup on a short week against the 49ers on Thursday Night Football in Week 5.</p> <h4 id="rhamondre-stevenson-rb">Rhamondre Stevenson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Stevenson outpaced TreVeyon Henderson (seven) and Antonio Gibson (six) in carries despite his Week 3 fumbling nightmare, as head coach Mike Vrabel held true to his word about not dinging Stevenson’s workload. Sunday’s game script also allowed New England to take a ground-centric approach due to its large lead. Stevenson appears to still be the top option – albeit by a thin margin – in a three-man committee heading into a Week 5 road showdown against the Bills next Sunday night.</p> <h4 id="spencer-rattler-qb">Spencer Rattler (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Rattler attempted fewer than 34 passes and threw for under 200 yards for the first time this season. The second-year quarterback has been underwhelming despite averaging 39.7 passing attempts through the first three regular-season games. Sunday’s outing also marked the first time this season that the Saints have had more rushing attempts (34) than passing attempts (28). Rattler’s production may suffer again if the Saints lean into the running game during their Week 5 matchup against the Giants, whose defense has allowed a league-worst 6.1 yards per carry.</p> <h4 id="aj-brown-wr">A.J. Brown (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> After coming to life with a 6-109-1 line against the Rams in Week 3, Brown’s production slumped again. The veteran wideout’s yardage total was a new season low and his second single-digit yardage figure over the first four games of 2025. Jalen Hurts did try to get the ball in Brown’s hands however, and he has 27 targets in his last three contests. Brown could struggle once again to build momentum as the Broncos’ suffocating secondary comes to town next Sunday afternoon for a tough Week 5 matchup.</p> <h4 id="brian-robinson-jr-rb">Brian Robinson Jr. (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Robinson logged only two more snaps on offense (eight) than he did Week 3, but he finished with three more carries Sunday than the two he received against Arizona. Christian McCaffrey continued to dominate San Francisco’s backfield usage, taking 23 touches for 141 yards from scrimmage and a touchdown in the team’s first loss of the campaign. Robinson is the clear No. 2 behind McCaffrey, but there simply isn’t enough scraps left for another rusher to thrive in this offense. The 26-year-old Robinson is not a viable fantasy option for Week 5 when the 49ers face the Rams on Thursday Night Football.</p> <h4 id="cooper-kupp-wr">Cooper Kupp (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Kupp tied Jaxon Smith-Njigba for the team lead in receptions and targets on a night when Sam Darnold spread the ball around to eight different pass catchers overall. However, the veteran wideout averaged just 6.5 yards per catch, but the fact he remains a clear No. 2 option in what is a mostly concentrated air attack will continue to afford Kupp a degree of fantasy value, especially in PPR formats. The veteran wideout will now have some extra time to gear up for a Week 5 home matchup against the Buccaneers on Sunday, Oct. 5.</p> <h4 id="sam-darnold-qb">Sam Darnold (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Darnold extended the strong start to his Seahawks tenure with his second straight interception-less game and third consecutive with at least one touchdown pass. The scoring toss came early, as he connected with AJ Barner for a 16-yard strike late in the first quarter. Darnold didn’t start clicking with top target Jaxon Smith-Njigba until late in the third quarter, but he subsequently hit his No. 1 receiver for several key completions in the final period. The last of those came with 23 seconds remaining, a 22-yard connection that helped position Jason Myers for an eventual game-winning field goal. Darnold will head into a Week 5 home showdown against the Cardinals on Sunday, Oct. 5 with a 70.0 percent completion rate, a 5:2 TD:INT and 38 rushing yards on three attempts across his first four games.</p> <h4 id="jaxon-smith-njigba-wr">Jaxon Smith-Njigba (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Smith-Njigba shockingly didn’t make his first catch until 49 seconds remained in the third quarter, but he’d curiously logged three rush attempts by that point. The talented wideout’s moonlighting came to an end down the stretch, however, as he contributed key receptions of 11, 36 and 22 yards in the fourth quarter. The latter catch positioned the Seahawks at the Cardinals’ 40-yard line with 23 seconds remaining. Jason Myers would knock home a game-winning 52-yard field goal two plays later, and Smith-Njigba finished with a solid stat line after his night looked to be in danger of being a washout. Smith-Njigba has seen his reception and receiving yardage totals drop over that of the previous game in each of the last three contests, but he remains Sam Darnold’s unquestioned No. 1 target heading into a Week 5 home matchup against the Buccaneers on Sunday, Oct. 5.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_4_2025_RRT_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_4_2025_RRT_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week4"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry></feed>
