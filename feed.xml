</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="michael-carter-rb">Michael Carter (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Carter was expected to step into an expanded role with both James Conner (foot) and Trey Benson (knee) sidelined, though it was unclear exactly how touches would be distributed. Carter resoundingly served as the lead back for Arizona, accounting for 23 total touches, while Emari Demercado and Bam Knight combined for nine. He wasn’t particularly efficient with the touches, though he did manage to find the end zone on a one-yard plunge early in the first quarter. Carter’s involvement as a receiver was also particularly notable, as Demercado was projected to take over duties as the primary pass catcher out of the backfield. Carter looks to have reliable volume heading into a Week 6 matchup against the Colts, though this situation could remain fluid.</p> <h4 id="lamar-jackson-qb">Lamar Jackson (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Out <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Glazer’s dispatch essentially matches what Brian Wacker of The Baltimore Sun reported Tuesday, when he noted that the two-time league MVP would be facing an estimated 2-to-3-week recovery timeline from the hamstring injury he sustained in last Sunday’s loss to the Chiefs. Though the Ravens appear set to wait and see how Jackson progresses in his recovery over the next several days before deciding on his status for the matchup with the Rams, the team is on bye Week 7, which could incentivize Baltimore to hold him out until then to give him added time to heal up. Cooper Rush will step in for Jackson as the Ravens’ starting quarterback against the Texans.</p> <h4 id="dillon-gabriel-qb">Dillon Gabriel (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Gabriel drew his first NFL start in a tough situation, traveling overseas to London while facing one of the more intricate defenses in the league. He handled himself well, as he didn’t turn the ball over and was sacked only twice. While Gabriel primarily worked in the short areas of the field, he did manage a pair of completions of more than 20 yards and led two lengthy touchdown drives. There will still be plenty of chatter about the quarterback situation in Cleveland, but Gabriel made a positive first impression as the team’s starter.</p> <h4 id="quinshon-judkins-rb">Quinshon Judkins (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Judkins’ takeover of the Cleveland backfield continued, as he accounted for 23 of 29 rush attempts by running backs. Even with plenty of attention from the Minnesota defense, Judkins ripped off long runs of 32,14 and 14 yards on the ground to top 100 rushing yards in a game for the first time in his career. Jerome Ford and Dylan Sampson will take away some opportunities as a pass catcher, but Judkins has a reliable workload and has been very effective through four games as a pro.</p> <h4 id="jameson-williams-wr">Jameson Williams (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Williams was coming off an eight-target performance in Week 4, but he had very limited involvement in Sunday’s blowout victory. Both of his touches came on Detroit’s first two drives of the game. While Jared Goff only took to the air 23 times to limit opportunities across the board, Williams has five or fewer targets in all but one game so far this season.</p> <h4 id="nico-collins-wr">Nico Collins (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> It was a solid day for Collins, highlighted by long gains of 24 and 14 yards as well as a 10-yard touchdown. However, he finished third on the team in receiving yards and was out-targeted by Dalton Schultz. That was likely affected by game script – C.J. Stroud attempted only 10 passes in the second half and was benched for most of the fourth quarter – but Collins has now seen six or fewer targets and recorded under 55 receiving yards in three of five games this season. His three touchdowns have covered up some of that lack of volume, but Collins hasn’t put up the big reception or target totals expected entering the season.</p> <h4 id="jonathan-taylor-rb">Jonathan Taylor (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Taylor encountered plenty of resistance from the Raiders defense on many of his runs, but he found enough running room to record scoring rushes of three, one and six yards, as well as a game-long 16-yard scamper. It was Taylor’s second three-touchdown tally of the season, a two-game sample that accounts for all his end-zone trips to date. The sixth-year pro remains the component around which the Colts’ prolific offense revolves, and Taylor should be very busy once again in a Week 6 home interconference clash with the Cardinals next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="brock-bowers-te">Brock Bowers (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Out <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Bowers was unable to play through the PCL injury in Week 5 against the Colts, and it seems the Raiders are finally considering letting their star tight end recover and get close to 100 percent after he played through the injury the first four weeks of the season. Bowers is genuinely looking questionable for Sunday’s Week 6 bout with the Titans. If Bowers is unable to play, Michael Mayer (concussion) would likely handle starter-level snaps, as long as Mayer is able to clear the concussion protocol after missing the past two games.</p> <h4 id="tua-tagovailoa-qb">Tua Tagovailoa (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Tagovailoa managed well in his first game without Tyreek Hill (IR, knee), focusing a majority of his attention, as expected, on the trio of Jaylen Waddle, Darren Waller and De’Von Achane. The three pass catchers were responsible for Tagovailoa’s three TD tosses and 17 of his completions overall. The 2020 first-round pick has multiple touchdown passes in four straight games – and Sunday’s tally was a season high – but with Miami at 1-4, the overall long-term outlook for the Dolphins is bleak. A Week 6 home matchup against the Chargers could be an uphill battle for the short-handed offensive unit as well, even when factoring in Los Angeles’ struggles against the Commanders in Week 5.</p> <h4 id="jaylen-waddle-wr">Jaylen Waddle (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> In his first full game this season without Tyreek Hill (IR, knee) alongside him, Waddle stepped up as expected and led the Dolphins across the board in receptions, receiving yards and targets. The talented veteran had another couple of close calls downfield that could have resulted in an even bigger day, but as it was, Waddle posted new season highs in catches, receiving yards and targets. He also recorded his third touchdown of the season on a go-ahead 46-yard grab with just under five minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, making it a productive all-around day despite the disappointing team outcome. Waddle will aim to put together a successful encore performance in a tough Week 6 home matchup against the Chargers next Sunday afternoon.</p> <h4 id="jordan-addison-wr">Jordan Addison (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Kevin Seifert of ESPN.com reported Addison was subject to a first-quarter benching for undisclosed reasons, but the third-year wideout ultimately would make up for lost time in clutch fashion. Addison was efficient with his opportunities, and the bulk of those came at the tail end of the Vikings’ game-winning drive late in the fourth quarter. Addison was on the receiving end of each of Carson Wentz’s final three completions and totaled 21 yards on those catches, the last which was a go-ahead 12-yard touchdown grab. For his part, Addison conceded afterward that he wasn’t sure if he’d even be able to play in the game, per Seifert, but he made good on his vow to be ready if he did step on the field. Following the completion of his season-opening three-game suspension, Addison has immediately played a key part in Minnesota’s air attack with a 9-155-1 line on 14 targets over his first two contests. He’ll now prepare to play his first 2025 game stateside following the Week 6 bye when the Vikings host the Eagles on Sunday, Oct. 19 in a contest that could also provide Addison his first regular-season opportunity to work with J.J. McCarthy (ankle) as his quarterback.</p> <h4 id="jordan-mason-rb">Jordan Mason (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Mason’s rushing opportunities were limited, but he locked in a solid fantasy day with a three-yard touchdown run to cap off the first drive of the second half. The offseason addition generally found tough sledding on the ground outside of the short score and his game-long 14-yard run, but he continued to keep Minnesota’s ground attack viable in the ongoing absence of Aaron Jones (IR, hamstring). Mason should be in line to remain the lead back when the Vikings come out of the Week 6 bye with a Week 7 home matchup against the Eagles on Sunday, Oct. 19.</p> <h4 id="mason-taylor-te">Mason Taylor (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The rookie tight end led the Jets in catches and targets and was only four yards back of Garrett Wilson for the team lead in that category as well. Taylor is blossoming now that he’s put an early-season ankle issue behind him, and over the last three games he’s delivered an 18-150-0 line on 25 targets as he begins to establish himself as the team’s No. 2 pass-catching option behind Wilson. Taylor will look for his first career touchdown in Week 6 against the Broncos.</p> <h4 id="garrett-wilson-wr">Garrett Wilson (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Rookie tight end Mason Taylor actually led the Jets in targets with 12 and catches with nine, but Wilson once again paced the team in receiving yards and was on the other end of Justin Fields’ second TD toss of the afternoon on New York’s final possession. While he has yet to hit 100 yards in a game this season, Wilson will take an impressive 33-382-4 line on 48 targets into a Week 6 tilt with Patrick Surtain and the Broncos’ stingy secondary.</p> <h4 id="jaylen-warren-rb">Jaylen Warren (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Out <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Warren missed the Steelers’ Week 4 game against the Vikings in Ireland and had the Week 5 bye to recover. Pittsburgh isn’t required to release an official practice report until Wednesday this week, but Warren’s presence on the field Monday would indicate he’s closing in on being 100 percent and returning to game action ahead of Sunday’s date with the Browns.</p> <h4 id="jauan-jennings-wr">Jauan Jennings (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Out <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> out</p> <h4 id="tyjae-spears-rb">Tyjae Spears (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Spears was activated from injured reserve and able to suit up for the first time in 2025 after recovering from an ankle injury. He unsurprisingly worked as the clear backup to Tony Pollard, managing a pair of five-yard gains on his four carries. Spears could see his role expand as the season progresses.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_5_2025_90s_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_5_2025_90s_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week5"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Abbey’s TNT Team Week 5 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-5-ARV/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Abbey’s TNT Team Week 5 Report"/><published>2025-10-07T11:59:52+00:00</published><updated>2025-10-07T11:59:52+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-5-ARV</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-5-ARV/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Abbey’s TNT Team 🧨 Lost against Americas Team 145.70-178.27<br/> Current Standing: #5<br/> Playoff Chances: 66.6%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 93.0%<br/> Best Performer: Emeka Egbuka (27.80 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="bijan-robinson-rb">Bijan Robinson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The 181 scrimmage yards were a career high for Robinson, as he hit the century mark in receiving yards for the second time in four games to begin the season. The third-year RB scored on a 14-yard run in the second quarter, his first TD on the ground in 2025, and he’s topped 100 combined yards in every game so far. Robinson has amassed 314 rushing yards and 274 receiving yards through four weeks, earning a well-deserved rest during Atlanta’s Week 5 bye before facing the Bills in Week 6.</p> <h4 id="xavier-legette-wr">Xavier Legette (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Making his return from a two-game absence due to a hamstring injury, Legette made an impact with a seven-yard scoring grab late in the second quarter that ignited a comeback from a 17-0 deficit. Despite the score, the 2024 first-round pick continues to struggle to generate anything resembling useful fantasy production, as he now has a 6-39-1 line on 18 targets through his three games. Bryce Young’s struggles with consistency and accuracy are partly to blame, but Legette isn’t the most inspiring fantasy prospect despite a favorable Week 6 home matchup against the Cowboys next Sunday afternoon.</p> <h4 id="colston-loveland-te">Colston Loveland (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Out <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> out</p> <h4 id="dylan-sampson-rb">Dylan Sampson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Not much changed for Sampson with the switch from quarterback Joe Flacco to Dillon Gabriel. Sampson’s seven snaps Sunday was the third consecutive game with fewer than 10 for the rookie, whose role has diminished since Quinshon Judkins entered the picture Week 2.</p> <h4 id="jaydon-blue-rb">Jaydon Blue (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> With Miles Sanders (ankle) and KaVontae Turpin (foot) both sidelined, Blue drew into the game-day lineup for the first time but didn’t see much usage. It would likely take an injury to Cowboys lead back Javonte Williams for Blue to get onto the fantasy radar.</p> <h4 id="bo-nix-qb">Bo Nix (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Nix had his fair share of struggles against the Eagles’ talented defense, but he helped lead Denver back from a 17-3 second-half deficit. Nix led a trio of fourth-quarter scoring drives, capping one of them with an 11-yard touchdown pass to Evan Engram and following it up with a two-point conversion toss to Troy Franklin. Nix has at least one touchdown pass in every game thus far this season and has posted his two highest passing yardage totals of the campaign in the last pair of contests heading into a Week 6 trip across the pond to face the Jets in London.</p> <h4 id="kalif-raymond-wr">Kalif Raymond (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Raymond remained on the turf for some time after taking a hit on an 11-yard punt return in second quarter before walking off the field under his own power. His only contribution to Sunday’s box score was the aforementioned return, as he had no targets at the time of his exit.</p> <h4 id="geno-smith-qb">Geno Smith (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The left half of Smith’s stat line looked perfectly acceptable, but the two picks, four sacks and quarterback rating of 18.9 that comprise the rest of his numbers all underscore how difficult the afternoon was. The Raiders’ day actually started off in encouraging fashion via a marathon 16-play, 80-yard drive that consumed 9:50 of the first quarter, but that ultimately culminated in a field goal. The next five possessions would feature a blocked punt, both of Smith’s interceptions, a punt and a missed field goal, helping dig Las Vegas into a hole it couldn’t recover from. Smith has now thrown nine interceptions over his first five games at the helm of the Raiders’ offense, including three contests in which he’s tossed multiple picks. Nevertheless, Smith will continue under center, potentially without Brock Bowers (knee) once again, when the Raiders welcome in the Titans for a favorable Week 6 home clash.</p> <h4 id="kyren-williams-rb">Kyren Williams (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Williams averaged an impressive 4.6 yards per carry with a long gain of 20 yards, but it was via his work as a receiver that he made the biggest impact by far. His reception, receiving yardage and target totals were all season highs, and he added his second and third receiving touchdowns of the campaign on 14- and eight-yard grabs in the second and fourth quarters, respectively. However, the star running back’s night ended on quite the sour note, as he was stuffed on a fourth-and-1 play that ended the game. Williams notably logged 13 more carries than backfield mate Blake Corum in Thursday’s loss, a reminder that the former is still the clear leader of the ground attack heading into a Week 6 road matchup against the Ravens on Sunday, Oct. 12.</p> <h4 id="puka-nacua-wr">Puka Nacua (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Nacua was in the customary position of leading the Rams in receptions and targets while checking in second in receiving yards. The prolific pass catcher also brought in one of Matthew Stafford’s three touchdown passes, recording a one-yard scoring grab with just under four minutes remaining in the third quarter. Nacua now has three consecutive double-digit reception and target totals, and he’s posted both of his touchdowns this season in the last pair of contests. Nacua will remain Stafford’s most reliable target in a Week 6 road matchup against the Ravens on Sunday, Oct. 12.</p> <h4 id="tyreek-hill-wr">Tyreek Hill (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Injured Reserve <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Per Marcel Louis-Jacques of ESPN, Hill – who underwent a major procedure Tuesday to repair his dislocated left knee and multiple torn ligaments, including his ACL – won’t need additional surgery, with agent Drew Rosenhaus indicating afterward that the wideout will play next season, while noting that “the realistic goal is the start of the season.” In Hill’s absence for the rest of the 2025 campaign, Malik Washington and Nick Westbrook-Ikhine are in line to see expanded roles alongside top WR Jaylen Waddle, with Dee Eskridge, Cedrick Wilson and Tahj Washington available to mix in.</p> <h4 id="cade-otton-te">Cade Otton (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Otton set new season highs in targets, receptions and yardage. The veteran starter produced next to nothing over his previous four appearances, literally saddling managers with bagels in the box score for Weeks 1 and 3. The 26-year-old is averaging 4.5 targets in the two games Mike Evans (hamstring) has missed, highlighting a window of elevated usage for the tight end while the team’s star wideout is sidelined. Otton’s strong results immediately put him back on the map at a shallow fantasy position for next Sunday’s tilt against the 49ers.</p> <h4 id="emeka-egbuka-wr">Emeka Egbuka (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Egbuka was unconscious in Sunday’s thrilling victory, catching every ball thrown his way en route to a new career high in receiving yards (163). The standout rookie continued to step up in the absence of Mike Evans (hamstring), who missed his second game recovering from a Week 3 injury. Egbuka produced his second consecutive game with 100-plus yards and a trip to the end zone, proving that he can adequately fill his superstar teammate’s shoes as Tampa Bay’s No. 1 wideout. The Ohio State product is also proving that he can produce WR1 numbers for fantasy managers heading into a matchup against the 49ers next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="calvin-ridley-wr">Calvin Ridley (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Ridley entered Sunday’s game having recorded only 141 yards combined across his first four games of the season. He finally got on track against the Cardinals, accounting for the Titans’ three longest plays from scrimmage with receptions of 47, 38 and 25 yards. His longest two came at particularly opportune times, as he helped set up a touchdown early in the fourth quarter before getting Tennessee into field-goal range to attempt the game-winning kick as time expired. It will still be difficult to consistently trust Ridley given his start to the season, but it was encouraging to see him display some rapport with Cam Ward.</p> <h4 id="deebo-samuel-wr">Deebo Samuel (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Samuel overcame a heel injury during the practice week to lead a shorthanded Washington receiver room Sunday. The star acquisition led his new club in targets, receptions and receiving yards while catching QB Jayden Daniels’ only passing touchdown of the contest. The 29-year-old has turned back the clock in 2025, generating 346 yards of offense and four total touchdowns through five games. Even if No. 1 wideout Terry McLaurin (quadriceps) returns against the Bears next Monday, Samuel’s consistent production makes him a must-start asset in fantasy for Week 6.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_5_2025_ARV_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_5_2025_ARV_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week5"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Big Titi Energy Week 5 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-5-BTE/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Big Titi Energy Week 5 Report"/><published>2025-10-07T11:59:52+00:00</published><updated>2025-10-07T11:59:52+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-5-BTE</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-5-BTE/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Big Titi Energy Won against To Infinity and Bijan! 147.85-132.22<br/> Current Standing: #11<br/> Playoff Chances: 6.0%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 83.4%<br/> Best Performer: C.J.

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="cooper-rush-qb">Cooper Rush (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Rush led the Ravens on a decent first drive that resulted in a field goal, completing all five of his pass attempts for 59 yards. Things imploded from there, however, as the Ravens turned in consecutive three-and-outs to end the first half before Rush threw three picks in the final two quarters. The one positive is that Rush was able to complete a long pass to Zay Flowers, salvaging the star receiver’s fantasy day. Rush could be lined up for a Week 6 start against the Rams, pending Lamar Jackson’s (hamstring) recovery.</p> <h4 id="dalton-kincaid-te">Dalton Kincaid (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Buffalo’s offense looked out of sync for much of the game, but Kincaid was a bright spot. He recorded the first 100-yard receiving performance of his career in both regular-season and postseason contests, powered by a very efficient effort on six targets. Kincaid caught three passes of at least 20 yards, matching his total from the first four games of the season. Kincaid has also earned exactly six targets in three of his last four games, making him reliably involved in one of the most efficient offenses in the league.</p> <h4 id="dj-moore-wr">DJ Moore (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The 28-year-old took a back seat to Rome Odunze (4-69-1) yet again, as a changing of the guard appears to have taken place in Chicago’s receiver room. Moore still possesses a consistent role in new head coach Ben Johnson’s offense, garnering five to six targets on a weekly basis, but expectations need to be tempered even if QB Caleb Williams takes a big step forward coming out of Chicago’s upcoming Week 5 bye.</p> <h4 id="jake-browning-qb">Jake Browning (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> “We’ll see,” Taylor said when questioned about Browning starting at Green Bay. Taylor added that he’s evaluating everything. When coaches start to distance themselves from the quarterback, it tends to signal an upcoming change. Browning has been downright horrific under center in three starts since Joe Burrow’s toe injury. Browning completely bottomed out against the Lions on Sunday, throwing three more interceptions to push his season total to eight in just four appearances. He padded his stats late in garbage time. The Bengals haven’t even been competitive the last three weeks with Browning at quarterback. Other options currently in the organization are Brett Rypien, Mike White and Sean Clifford. It’s a dire situation.</p> <h4 id="tee-higgins-wr">Tee Higgins (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Higgins was unable to record a catch on his first three targets and had only seven yards for the first 55 minutes of game time. He saved his day with a 13-yard catch followed by a two-yard touchdown grab late in the fourth quarter, but it was another disastrous day for the Bengals’ offense led by Jake Browning. Despite his undeniable talent, Higgins is a risky fantasy start every week, but particularly heading into a Week 6 matchup against the Packers.</p> <h4 id="jerome-ford-rb">Jerome Ford (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Ford’s seven touches on offense, 38 yards from scrimmage and 116 combined yards were his most since Week 2, when he was still a factor before Quinshon Judkins became the lead running back. Cleveland’s switch to rookie quarterback Dillon Gabriel was the reason for Ford’s increased touches. To make life easier on Gabriel, the Browns deployed a run-heavy offense and had a 50/50 split between rushes and pass attempts. They also got right tackle Jack Conklin (elbow) back, which helped Cleveland amass a season-high 140 yards on the ground. Barring a Judkins injury, Ford’s days as the lead back are over, but Sunday’s game plan showed how the Browns offense can be competitive.</p> <h4 id="christian-kirk-wr">Christian Kirk (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Kirk had his best day as a Texan due primarily to a 47-yard catch to start the fourth quarter, narrowly missing a touchdown while being taken down at the three-yard line. Houston has spread its targets relatively evenly between several different pass catchers early this season, leaving Kirk with only four targets in consecutive games. That limited volume will hurt his fantasy outlook, though Sunday’s big play was encouraging.</p> <h4 id="cj-stroud-qb">C.J. Stroud (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Stroud faced a thinned version of the Baltimore defense that was missing Kyle Hamilton (groin), Marlon Humphrey (calf) and Chidobe Awuzie (hamstring) in its secondary alone. He took advantage of the good spot, throwing more than three touchdowns for only the second time in his career while completing three passes of at least 20 yards. Stroud was ultimately pulled early in the fourth quarter due to the game being a blowout, but it was a positive fantasy performance and also a good showing for the Houston offense overall.</p> <h4 id="jj-mccarthy-qb">J.J. McCarthy (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Out <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> out</p> <h4 id="demario-douglas-wr">DeMario Douglas (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Douglas, who was on the field for 17 of a possible 60 snaps on offense, per Mike Reiss of ESPN.com, was out-snapped in the contest by fellow WRs Kayshon Boutte (37), Mack Hollins (35) and Stefon Diggs (30). With just seven catches for 30 yards and a TD on 16 targets in five games, Douglas is off the lineup radar in all but the deepest of fantasy formats.</p> <h4 id="juwan-johnson-te">Juwan Johnson (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The tight end produced his worst numbers of 2025, and while the returns of Taysom Hill and Foster Moreau from knee injuries didn’t cut into Johnson’s workload at all – he was on the field for 56 offensive snaps (85 percent) – Spencer Rattler and the Saints’ offense did make an effort to attack downfield more than they had in the first month of the year. That change may have had more to do with the quality of the Giants’ secondary than it did any growth in Rattler’s game, but the window for Johnson to be a reliable fantasy option may be closing rapidly. He’ll try to bounce back in Week 6 against the Patriots.</p> <h4 id="breece-hall-rb">Breece Hall (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The running back briefly left the game in the first half after fumbling in the red zone late in the second quarter, but Hall returned in the second half and racked up some big yardage once again in a losing effort. The 113 rushing yards were a season high for the fourth-year RB, as were the 42 receiving yards, but he’s still looking for his first touchdown of 2025 – something he came agonizing close to in the fourth quarter, when he was tackled just short of the goal line on a 16-yard reception. Hall will look to get into the end zone in Week 6 against a Broncos defense that just gave up a 47-yard receiving TD to Saquon Barkley, but otherwise held him in check.</p> <h4 id="dallas-goedert-te">Dallas Goedert (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Goedert was surprisingly second on the Eagles in targets, but he had the third-fewest receiving yards during an inefficient afternoon against a tough Denver defense. Nevertheless, Goedert got into the end zone for the third time in the last two games on a two-yard catch just past the halfway point of the second quarter. Goedert has all four of his touchdowns this season in the last three games, and although he’s averaging only 8.9 yards per reception, he remains an intriguing option at his position for a favorable road Week 6 matchup against the Giants on Thursday night.</p> <h4 id="zach-charbonnet-rb">Zach Charbonnet (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Charbonnet finished with one less carry than Kenneth Walker (10-86-0) in the loss, but it was the former who punched in Seattle’s only rushing score of the contest. The 24-year-old Charbonnet received seven fewer carries than the starter in his return from a foot injury in Week 4, but Sunday’s near-even split in touches indicates a potential timeshare moving forward. If that trend holds true, then Charbonnet would see a slight bump in value at Walker’s expense heading into next Sunday’s tilt against the Jaguars.</p> <h4 id="kenneth-walker-iii-rb">Kenneth Walker III (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Walker led Seattle in both carries and rushing production in Week 5, but it was backfield mate Zach Charbonnet (9-36-1) who cashed in the team’s only rushing score in the loss. The touch distribution was far closer this time around compared to last week’s seven-carry difference in the latter’s return from injury, confirming the timeshare that exists when both runners are at full strength. Both players are worthy of flex spots in Week 6, even in a timeshare, with Walker being the preferred option for his early-down usage.</p> <h4 id="terry-mclaurin-wr">Terry McLaurin (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Out <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> McLaurin has missed the Commanders’ past two games and hasn’t even returned to practice yet, but Quinn’s optimism suggests the star wideout could be on the practice field at some point this week. With McLaurin and Noah Brown (groin/knee) missing the past two contests, Washington has leaned on Deebo Samuel as the unquestioned WR1 while cycling through Luke McCaffrey, Chris Moore, Jaylin Lane and Tay Martin behind Samuel.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_5_2025_BTE_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_5_2025_BTE_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week5"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Emma’s Excellent Team Week 5 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-5-EET/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Emma’s Excellent Team Week 5 Report"/><published>2025-10-07T11:59:52+00:00</published><updated>2025-10-07T11:59:52+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-5-EET</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-5-EET/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Emma’s Excellent Team Lost against Rookie Mistake 105.14-120.40<br/> Current Standing: #12<br/> Playoff Chances: 1.7%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 84.4%<br/> Best Performer: Trevor Lawrence (30.24 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="drake-london-wr">Drake London (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The fourth-year wideout didn’t reach 60 receiving yards or find the end zone in the first three weeks of the season, but London broke out in Week 4, highlighting his performance with a five-yard TD reception from Michael Penix in the first quarter. London led the Falcons in targets – no one else got more than five – as well as catches and receiving yards, and he remains the unquestioned top option in the team’s passing game headed into a Week 5 bye, ahead of a tough Week 6 battle against the Bills.</p> <h4 id="joshua-palmer-wr">Joshua Palmer (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Palmer was held to a 23-yard catch in the the second quarter for much of the game before hauling in a 13-yard grab on the last play of regulation. He was on the field for 35 of 68 offensive snaps (51.5 percent), which was third most among Bills wide receivers behind Khalil Shakir (43) and Keon Coleman (42). Palmer saw nine targets in his Bills debut Week 1 against the Ravens, but he has seen three looks or less from Josh Allen in each of the four games since. The lack of targets makes Palmer hard to count on from a fantasy perspective heading into Buffalo’s Week 6 road contest against Atlanta on Monday, Oct. 13.</p> <h4 id="courtland-sutton-wr">Courtland Sutton (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Sutton led the Broncos in receptions, receiving yards and targets on the afternoon, recording a team-high 34-yard catch along the way. The veteran wideout fell just short of what would have been his second 100-yard game of the campaign, but he’s now posted at least 81 receiving yards in three straight contests. Sutton figures to remain Bo Nix’s top target when the Broncos travel to London to face the Jets in a Week 6 clash next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="trevor-lawrence-qb">Trevor Lawrence (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Lawrence put the Jaguars on his shoulders for the majority of the night despite a critical early second-quarter fumble at Kansas City’s one-yard line, helping spearhead a comeback from an early 14-0 deficit with a three-yard touchdown pass to Parker Washington and the first of two rushing scores to knot the game back up just before the halfway point of the third quarter. Lawrence then saved his best for the most important part of the contest, leading a seven-play, 60-yard game-winning march that he capped off with an eventful one-yard touchdown run that began with him stumbling twice due to having his foot stepped on by an offensive lineman as he dropped back. Lawrence still is a work in progress in head coach Liam Coen’s offense, but he completed a season-best 72.0 percent of his passes Monday night ahead of a Week 6 home matchup against a Seahawks defense that allowed the Buccaneers’ Baker Mayfield to complete 29 of 33 passes for 379 yards and two TDs in Seattle’s Week 5 loss.</p> <h4 id="hollywood-brown-wr">Hollywood Brown (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Brown tied for second on the Chiefs in targets while checking in third in both receptions and receiving yards. The busy night for the veteran wideout was par for the course thus far this season, as Brown has no fewer than five targets in any of his first five contests. Brown also recorded his first catch of at least 20 yards since Week 1 on Monday night, and he’ll continue to profile as a key target for Patrick Mahomes in a Week 6 Sunday night showdown at home against the Lions.</p> <h4 id="jakobi-meyers-wr">Jakobi Meyers (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> With Brock Bowers (knee) unavailable, the expectation was that Meyers would be even busier than usual in his role as the Raiders’ No. 1 receiver. However, all of Tre Tucker, Ashton Jeanty and even practice squad call-up Albert Okwuegbunam outpaced Meyers in receptions, receiving yards or both. After opening the season in typically productive fashion with a 17-228-0 line on 26 targets over his first three games, Meyers has slumped to an 8-62-0 tally on 13 targets over the last pair of contests. The veteran will have a good opportunity to bounce back in Week 6, however, as a suspect Titans defense comes to Las Vegas next Sunday afternoon.</p> <h4 id="rashid-shaheed-wr">Rashid Shaheed (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Most of that production came on a single play – an 87-yard catch-and-run in the second quarter that Shaheed took to the house. The fourth-year wideout hadn’t exceeded 52 receiving yards in a game this year prior to Sunday, and second-year QB Spencer Rattler may not be able to find his deep threat so easily against more competent secondaries, but it was still an encouraging sign for Shaheed and the Saints’ aerial attack. He’ll look for another big play or two in Week 6 against the Patriots.</p> <h4 id="saquon-barkley-rb">Saquon Barkley (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Barkley was notably listed as a non-participant on Monday’s practice estimate, but Rapoport’s report suggests that the star back isn’t in danger of being sidelined Thursday. That said, Barkley’s status still is worth monitoring ahead of Week 6 action, with added context on that front slated to arrive via Tuesday’s practice report.</p> <h4 id="brock-purdy-qb">Brock Purdy (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Out <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> out</p> <h4 id="george-kittle-te">George Kittle (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Injured Reserve <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> After missing the requisite four games upon being placed on IR following Week 1 action, Kittle will be eligible for activation during the upcoming week, but he seemingly hasn’t made enough progress in his recovery from a hamstring injury to put himself in consideration for a return just yet. The 49ers could still elect to open Kittle’s 21-day practice window next week, though Shanahan hinted that the team may prefer to wait until Week 7 before having the 31-year-old get back on the field, per Matt Barrows of The Athletic. While Kittle has been out for the past four weeks, the 49ers have had Jake Tonges and Luke Farrell share snaps at tight end, with the former player proving to be the more formidable pass-catching threat.</p> <h4 id="tony-pollard-rb">Tony Pollard (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> It was an eventful day for Pollard with significant swings in performance. He picked up 26 yards on four carries on the Titans’ opening drive, but his next notable contribution to the game was losing a fumble that set up an Arizona touchdown. Pollard then redeemed himself with a one-yard score of his own early in the fourth quarter to kickstart a frantic Tennessee comeback that resulted in the team’s first win of the season. Also notable was that Pollard out-touched Tyjae Spears 17-4, though Spears is likely to become more involved in future matchups. Pollard has done an admirable job early in the campaign given the state of Tennessee’s offense, picking up at least 60 yards on the ground in four of five games.</p> <h4 id="zach-ertz-te">Zach Ertz (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Despite Jayden Daniels returning from a knee injury in Week 5, Ertz had his worst game of the season. He was targeted just once and didn’t appear to be a part of the Commanders’ offensive game plan. Ertz still logged 30 offensive snaps and operated as Washington’s No. 1 tight end, playing ahead of John Bates (28 snaps) and Ben Sinnott (17 snaps). With both Terry McLaurin (quadriceps) and Noah Brown (groin/knee) sidelined Sunday, Ertz was expected to serve as one of the Commanders’ primary receiving threats but failed to capitalize. He’s likely to operate as Washington’s top tight end again in the Week 6 matchup against the Bears.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_5_2025_EET_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_5_2025_EET_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week5"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Game of Zones - House Hamlin Week 5 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-5-HMB/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Game of Zones - House Hamlin Week 5 Report"/><published>2025-10-07T11:59:52+00:00</published><updated>2025-10-07T11:59:52+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-5-HMB</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-5-HMB/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Game of Zones: House Hamlin Won against Michael’s Managable Team 122.87-119.91<br/> Current Standing: #1<br/> Playoff Chances: 83.7%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 87.4%<br/> Best Performer: Jacory Croskey-Merritt (26.00 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="zay-flowers-wr">Zay Flowers (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Flowers was unsurprisingly Cooper Rush’s favorite target, and he came away with a decent fantasy stat line despite the blowout loss. He did most of his damage on a deep pass down the field that went for 56 yards, with Flowers being tackled at the four-yard line to narrowly miss out on his second score of the season. Though it was an unsustainable way to get the production, Flowers has now topped 70 receiving yards in four of five games this season and will hope to get Lamar Jackson (hamstring) back for a Week 6 matchup against the Rams.</p> <h4 id="derrick-henry-rb">Derrick Henry (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Henry predictably couldn’t find much rushing room with Cooper Rush under center, with his longest gain of the day going for seven yards. He managed to avoid complete disaster by scoring a one-yard touchdown late in the third quarter, but he’s now been held to 50 rushing yards or fewer in four of five games to begin the season. Henry’s outlook in Week 6 will be highly dependent on Lamar Jackson’s (hamstring) availability, but he has another tough matchup against the Rams.</p> <h4 id="josh-allen-qb">Josh Allen (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Allen had an up-and-down showing, with his biggest mistake coming on an interception late in the third quarter that allowed New England to build a 10-point lead. He still had plenty of excellent stretches in the game, including completing five passes of at least 20 yards while delivering touchdowns of six and two yards. As is typically the case, Allen chipped in extra production on the ground, with a 19-yard scramble helping him top 50 rushing yards for the second time on the campaign. While it wasn’t Allen’s most prolific showing, he continues to deliver a very safe fantasy floor.</p> <h4 id="sam-laporta-te">Sam LaPorta (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> LaPorta made a quick impact in Sunday’s blowout win, logging a 22-yard reception on the third play of the game before capping the drive with an athletic 10-yard catch and run that resulted in a touchdown. His longest gain of the day came early in the third quarter and went for 39 yards – nearly entirely after the catch. LaPorta entered Sunday’s contest having been held under 40 yards in three straight games, so his highest yardage total and first touchdown of the season came at a needed time.</p> <h4 id="amon-ra-st-brown-wr">Amon-Ra St. Brown (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> St. Brown continued his excellent start to the season, leading the Lions in all receiving stats. He saw the majority of his volume in the first half, but his longest catch of the day was a 26-yard grab early in the fourth quarter. The only shortcoming was that St. Brown failed to find the end zone for the first time since Week 1, but he balanced that out by recording his second 100-yard receiving game of the campaign.</p> <h4 id="tucker-kraft-te">Tucker Kraft (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Kraft was one of four Packers pass catchers to record at least 50 yards, and he finished third on the team in targets. His biggest impact came on Green Bay’s opening possession, when he recorded two receptions for 22 yards and was tackled just short of the goal line. Kraft has at least four targets in all four games this season and has at least 50 receiving yards or a touchdown in three of four contests.</p> <h4 id="jordan-love-qb">Jordan Love (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Love has been efficient all season, and that didn’t change Sunday night as he averaged 7.8 yards per attempt while completing four passes of more than 20 yards. The Packers were also pushed offensively by Dak Prescott and the Cowboys, with Love attempting at least 40 passes for only the sixth time in a regular-season contest in his career. Love targeted seven pass catchers at least three times, though he connected with Romeo Doubs for all three of his touchdowns and hit Matthew Golden for a 46-yard gain – his longest of the night. Love has had mediocre fantasy results to begin the season, but he has multiple touchdown passes in three of four contests while topping 250 passing yards twice.</p> <h4 id="kareem-hunt-rb">Kareem Hunt (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Three of Hunt’s seven carries came from five yards or closer to the opponent’s goal line, and he punched two of them in successfully to finish as the Chiefs’ top fantasy RB in Week 5. Co-starter Isiah Pacheco also received seven carries while seeing two more targets as a receiver, but the latter’s lack of use in the red zone proved to be the difference Monday. Hunt now is up to three touchdowns on the year, but he leaves much to be desired as a fantasy asset in games he is held out of the end zone. The 29-year-old checks in as a touchdown-dependent flex option against the Lions on Sunday Night Football in Week 6.</p> <h4 id="juju-smith-schuster-wr">JuJu Smith-Schuster (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The veteran wideout’s workload is set to decline in a couple weeks when Rashee Rice returns from his six-game suspension, but Smith-Schuster continues to play a key role in the offense for KC in the meantime, as he led the wideout room with 57 offensive snaps (78 percent) in Week 4. Sunday’s effort marked the first time he’s reached double-digit PPR points this season, and he’ll likely remain a touchdown-dependent fantasy option while in a prominent role. That said, he has a decent matchup ahead versus the Jaguars in Week 5.</p> <h4 id="keenan-allen-wr">Keenan Allen (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Allen finished as the Chargers’ leading receiver in an overall forgettable offensive performance, resulting in middling fantasy numbers for managers Sunday. The veteran starter failed to hit pay dirt for the second week in a row after kicking off the campaign with a three-game scoring streak. Allen is still providing a solid fantasy floor by averaging 8.8 targets/game in his return to the Chargers, making him a safe option for next Sunday’s tilt against Miami.</p> <h4 id="blake-corum-rb">Blake Corum (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Corum’s six snaps on offense represents the first time this season he’s failed to crack the double-digit marker. Kyren Williams returned to fully dominating the timeshare, playing 62 snaps and garnering a total of 22 touches. Williams did have a costly fumble late in the fourth quarter and was stuffed on fourth-and-1 to end the game in overtime, but the momentum clearly seems to be shifting towards him reclaiming his monstrous usage of last season. A soft Baltimore defense leading the league in points allowed is up next in Week 6, but Corum’s steep decline in usage this week will make him difficult to trust in fantasy leagues.</p> <h4 id="kenneth-gainwell-rb">Kenneth Gainwell (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Jaylen Warren (knee) was surprisingly inactive Sunday morning, leaving Gainwell to fill in as Pittsburgh’s lead back. He did so admirably, scoring touchdowns from one and four yards away while also ripping off long gains of 15 and 10 yards. Gainwell also remained active as a pass catcher, giving him a well-rounded fantasy line. The Steelers are headed into their bye week, meaning this may be Gainwell’s only chance to handle this type of workload for the time being, but he proved plenty capable of handling the lead-back role if needed.</p> <h4 id="sterling-shepard-wr">Sterling Shepard (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Shepard overcame a minor foot injury early in the practice week in order to suit up without restrictions in Sunday’s win. The 32-year-old continued serving as the Buccaneers’ No. 3 receiver, occupying the vacancy left by Mike Evans (hamstring) in Weeks 4 and 5 after filling in for Chris Godwin over the team’s first three contests. If Evans remains sidelined for next Sunday’s tilt against the 49ers, Shepard can continue providing value in Week 6 for those in deeper formats.</p> <h4 id="cam-ward-qb">Cam Ward (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Ward had an abysmal performance for nearly the entire game, as he went only 5-for-16 for 58 yards through two quarters. He also threw an interception late in the fourth quarter that seemingly put an end to any comeback attempt for the Titans, only to have Dadrion Taylor-Demerson fumble the ball into the end zone for a touchdown for Tennessee. It wasn’t all bad news for Ward, as he connected on deep passes of 47 and 38 yards with Calvin Ridley as key parts of the Titans’ rally – his longest completions as a pro. While it’s positive that Ward was able to earn his first win in the NFL, his performance still left plenty to be desired, and he has at least one turnover in all five of his career starts.</p> <h4 id="jacory-croskey-merritt-rb">Jacory Croskey-Merritt (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Croskey-Merritt finally broke out of the backfield committee that was holding him back in fantasy with a dominating two-touchdown performance against the Chargers. The seventh-round rookie commanded 14 of Washington’s 20 running-back carries Sunday, eclipsing a personal high of 10 set back in his initial breakout game in Week 1. One would assume that the 150-yard, multi-score showing should cement the starting job for the Arizona product moving forward. A preseason darling heading into drafts, Croskey-Merritt’s managers can officially fire up the hype train heading into a soft matchup against the Bears next Monday.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_5_2025_HMB_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_5_2025_HMB_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week5"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Mama Daughter Duo Week 5 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-5-JST/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mama Daughter Duo Week 5 Report"/><published>2025-10-07T11:59:52+00:00</published><updated>2025-10-07T11:59:52+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-5-JST</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-5-JST/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Mama Daughter Duo Lost against Mcconky Donkeys 120.25-129.80<br/> Current Standing: #9<br/> Playoff Chances: 48.7%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 91.1%<br/> Best Performer: Christian McCaffrey (23.90 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="emari-demercado-rb">Emari Demercado (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Demercado was expected to see an expanded role in the absence of Trey Benson (knee), but Michael Carter dominated opportunities out of the backfield. Demercado’s lack of involvement as a pass catcher was particularly surprising, as he was not targeted. He looked to have made the case for a more expanded role with a long 72-yard touchdown run early in the fourth quarter, but he fumbled on a premature celebration before crossing the goal line for a touchback. The Cardinals still gave him one additional touch before the end of the game, but the key error isn’t likely to help his role heading into a Week 6 matchup against the Colts.</p> <h4 id="michael-penix-jr-qb">Michael Penix Jr. (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> After a rough Week 3 performance on the road in Carolina, Penix returned home in Week 4 and looked much more composed, topping his prior career high in yardage by one as he delivered his first multi-TD effort of 2025. The second-year QB hit Drake London for a five-yard score in the first quarter and Kyle Pitts for a seven-yard touchdown in the third, while both London and Bijan Robinson eclipsed the century mark in receiving yards, during a game in which Atlanta never trailed. Penix will get a week off for the Falcons’ bye before facing a tough test in Week 6 against the Bills.</p> <h4 id="dandre-swift-rb">D’Andre Swift (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Swift was limited during the practice week with a hip injury that had him listed as questionable leading up to Sunday’s kickoff. The veteran RB suited up and rewarded fantasy managers with his second trip to the end zone in four games this season. The Bears placed no restrictions on Swift, handing him 14 of its 18 running back carries in the win. He has been generating just enough value on a weekly basis to warrant flex consideration in most formats, but he won’t be available in Week 5 with the Bears on a bye, making Week 6 the next time Swift will be in action.</p> <h4 id="caleb-williams-qb">Caleb Williams (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Williams also put two balls on the ground, but he was fortunately able to recover both of his fumbles. The sophomore QB was coming off his best game of the season against the Cowboys, but he reverted to inconsistent form Sunday. We have seen flashes of brilliance from Williams in new head coach Ben Johnson’s scheme, but he still isn’t polished enough to be relied upon regularly. With the Bears entering their bye, Williams’ next action will come in Week 6 on Oct. 13 against the Commanders on Monday Night Football.</p> <h4 id="rome-odunze-wr">Rome Odunze (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Odunze’s scoring onslaught continued when he gutted the Raiders’ secondary for a 27-yard touchdown on Chicago’s first possession of the second half. The breakout fantasy star has generated five touchdowns during his impressive four-game scoring streak to kick off the season. Odunze’s eight targets Sunday were on par with his 8.8 average through four weeks, giving fantasy managers a reliable WR1 asset so far. The talented sophomore will attempt to extend his scoring streak when the Bears resume play against the Commanders in Week 6 on Oct. 13 following the team’s upcoming bye.</p> <h4 id="travis-kelce-te">Travis Kelce (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Kelce finally put it all together for his managers Week 5, producing his best fantasy score through five starts. The 35-year-old finished with a season-high seven receptions while scoring his second touchdown of the campaign. Even with his slow start to the season, Kelce is providing enough of a floor for fantasy managers with a 22-243-2 receiving line in 2025. Up next for the Chiefs will be a home tilt against a hot Lions squad on Sunday Night Football in Week 6.</p> <h4 id="hunter-henry-te">Hunter Henry (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Henry ripped off a pair of 20-plus yard receptions in order to check in as the Patriots’ second-leading receiver despite finishing with just the two receptions Sunday. The veteran starter failed to extend his modest scoring streak to three games on a night when the passing offense accounted for zero touchdowns. Henry has been a pleasant surprise in fantasy crossing the quarter point of the regular season, producing a 17-250-3 receiving line heading into a Week 6 matchup against the Saints next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="chris-olave-wr">Chris Olave (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The catches and targets were both team highs, but Olave’s output was overshadowed by an 87-yard TD by Rashid Shaheed in the second quarter that sparked the Saints’ offense to life. Olave remains the the top option for QB Spencer Rattler, but his volume hasn’t resulted in any big performances yet in 2025 – despite seeing double-digit targets in four of five games and 53 looks in total, he sports just a 33-244-1 line, and Sunday’s 59 receiving yards were actually his season high. He’ll try to make a bigger impact in Week 6 against the Patriots.</p> <h4 id="devonta-smith-wr">DeVonta Smith (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Smith shook off a highly undesirable matchup on paper to produce team-best totals in receptions, receiving yards and targets on the afternoon, as well as a season-long 52-yard catch. The Eagles’ unusual pass-centric approach Sunday certainly helped Smith’s numbers, but even on lower-volume days for the air attack, Smith has been the more consistent producer between him and A.J. Brown by far through Philadelphia’s first five games. Smith will take a 25-272-1 receiving line on 30 targets into a favorable Week 6 road matchup against the Giants on Thursday night.</p> <h4 id="jalen-hurts-qb">Jalen Hurts (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Despite the Broncos’ standout secondary and the fact they held a lead for a significant portion of the game, the Eagles curiously took a pass-centric approach Sunday, affording Saquon Barkley a scant six carries. Hurts recorded season highs in completions, pass attempts and passing yards, while also recording multiple touchdown tosses for the third consecutive game by connecting with Dallas Goedert (two yards) and Barkley (47 yards) in the second and third quarters, respectively. However, Hurts also took a season-high six sacks, and he threw incomplete on back-to-back plays from the Broncos’ 29-yard line to finish the game. Hurts was also much less involved than usual as a runner, but he draws an excellent matchup on a short week when the Eagles visit the Giants on Thursday night to kick off Week 6.</p> <h4 id="kaleb-johnson-rb">Kaleb Johnson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Jaylen Warren’s (knee) absence opened up a lot of opportunity in the Pittsburgh backfield. Kenneth Gainwell was the primary back and performed well, though Johnson did see the most significant opportunity of his rookie season. He was servicable in the role, picking up 14 yards on the ground on a drive early in the fourth quarter to help the Steelers to a field goal. Johnson isn’t likely to see much of a role when Pittsburgh returns to the field in Week 6, but it was a small step forward after a poor start to his rookie campaign.</p> <h4 id="dk-metcalf-wr">DK Metcalf (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Metcalf found the end zone in his third straight game while also tallying his first 100-yard receiving game as a Steeler. He did the majority of his damage on an 80-yard touchdown early in the second quarter, which came nearly entirely after the catch. Metcalf continues to be Aaron Rodgers’ favorite target among the downfield pass catchers, and he has at least 80 receiving yards in half of his four games in his nascent Steelers tenure.</p> <h4 id="rachaad-white-rb">Rachaad White (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> White got the spot-start in place of injured starter Bucky Irving (foot/shoulder) on Sunday, commanding 14 of the 18 carries Tampa Bay gave to its running backs in the win. The 26-year-old White masked an inefficient day on the ground (2.9 YPC) with a pair of trips to the end zone in a strong overall fantasy performance. Initial reports hinted that Irving could also miss next Sunday’s tilt against the 49ers, a scenario that would unlock another week of fantasy utility for White in Week 6.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_5_2025_JST_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_5_2025_JST_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week5"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Mcconky Donkeys Week 5 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-5-KTT/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mcconky Donkeys Week 5 Report"/><published>2025-10-07T11:59:52+00:00</published><updated>2025-10-07T11:59:52+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-5-KTT</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-5-KTT/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Mcconky Donkeys Won against Mama Daughter Duo 129.80-120.25<br/> Current Standing: #7<br/> Playoff Chances: 48.9%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 88.3%<br/> Best Performer: Baker Mayfield (41.16 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="tyler-allgeier-rb">Tyler Allgeier (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Bijan Robinson had a massive day with 21 touches, a career-high 181 scrimmage yards and a rushing TD of his own, but Allgeier still made an impact with a 15-yard score late in the third quarter. It was the fourth-year RB’s second touchdown of the season, and despite his backup role he’s been able to carve out some fantasy value behind Robinson, turning 41 carries through four weeks into 155 rushing yards. The Falcons will be on bye in Week 5, but Allgeier’s volume in Week 6 could depend on whether the team can keep things close against the Bills.</p> <h4 id="david-njoku-te">David Njoku (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Njoku was Dillon Gabriel’s favorite pass catcher, as Njoku led the team in targets, receptions and yards. His biggest contribution was a nine-yard touchdown catch late in the third quarter – his first of the season – and he also chipped in an impressive leaping catch just before halftime that went for 17 yards. This was by far Njoku’s most productive performance of the season and was a positive first showing with Gabriel.</p> <h4 id="evan-engram-te">Evan Engram (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Engram finished second in receptions and targets on an afternoon when Bo Nix spread the ball around to nine different pass catchers overall. The veteran tight end also scored his first touchdown in a Broncos uniform on an 11-yard catch just before the halfway point of the fourth quarter, and his receiving yardage total was a new season high. Engram has played a more short-area role than may have initially been expected upon his signing with Denver this offseason, but his upside keeps him a viable consideration at what can be a difficult position for reliable fantasy production.</p> <h4 id="troy-franklin-wr">Troy Franklin (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Franklin was a distant second in receiving yards to Courtland Sutton on the afternoon, and he tied for third in targets while recording a two-point conversion following Evan Engram’s fourth-quarter touchdown grab. Franklin, Bo Nix’s former Oregon teammate, has no fewer than four and as many as nine targets over Denver’s first five games, but he’s posted 44 receiving yards or fewer in three of those contests. Franklin will likely remain a relatively middling fantasy option in a Week 6 matchup against the Jets in London.</p> <h4 id="brian-thomas-jr-wr">Brian Thomas Jr. (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Thomas finished as the Jaguars’ leader in receptions, receiving yards and targets, holding the top spot in the middle category for the second consecutive week. His final catch of the night was the most critical, as he recorded a 33-yard grab on Jacksonville’s game-winning drive and then drew a pass interference penalty that wiped out an interception four plays later. Thomas’ yardage tally was also a new season high for the second-year wideout, who’s yet to have his first true breakout effort in head coach Liam Coen’s offense but has put together his two best all-around performances this season in the last pair of contests. Thomas will take a 16-244-0 line into a Week 6 home matchup against a Seahawks squad that just conceded a 163-yard, one-touchdown day to the Buccaneers’ Emeka Egbuka on Sunday.</p> <h4 id="isiah-pacheco-rb">Isiah Pacheco (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Pacheco excelled on a per-carry basis (5.1 YPC) while garnering the most targets out of the backfield for Kansas City on Monday. That’s where the good news ends, as fellow RB Kareem Hunt found the end zone twice on his seven rushing attempts in the loss. Pacheco’s fantasy value continues to be doused by the presence of his veteran teammate in an even timeshare, a scenario that should continue repeating itself against the Lions on Sunday.</p> <h4 id="ladd-mcconkey-wr">Ladd McConkey (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> McConkey responded well coming off of his worst receiving line as a pro last week (1-11-0), grabbing five receptions and his first touchdown of the 2025 season in a losing effort. The 23-year-old finished behind only Keenan Allen (nine) in targets Sunday, maintaining the former’s healthy average of 6.8 targets per game through five weeks. McConkey will attempt to ride the momentum from Sunday’s strong fantasy performance into a road tilt against the Dolphins in Week 6.</p> <h4 id="devon-achane-rb">De’Von Achane (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Achane came into the interconference battle with elevated expectations, considering the struggles of the Panthers against the run and the fact Tyreek Hill’s (IR, knee) absence was expected to open up even more pass-catching opportunities for the versatile back. The latter partly did come to fruition, as Achane recorded his third-highest reception and target tallies of the season and salvaged his fantasy day with an impressive 10-yard touchdown catch on the first play of the second quarter. However, the speedy back was surprisingly stymied on the ground, leading to a season-low rushing yardage total. Achane’s chances of a rebound Week 6 are kind of bleak as well, considering he’ll face off with a talented Chargers defense in South Florida.</p> <h4 id="darius-slayton-wr">Darius Slayton (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Slayton pulled up lame in the fourth quarter of Sunday’s loss to the Saints, and now the Giants have a short week ahead of Thursday night’s game against the Eagles. If Slayton is unable to play Week 6, Jalin Hyatt and Beaux Collins figure to see every-down snaps alongside slot man Wan’Dale Robinson, though the Giants could use more two-tight end sets featuring Daniel Bellinger.</p> <h4 id="wandale-robinson-wr">Wan’Dale Robinson (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Jaxson Dart wasn’t able to stretch the field much in his first game working without Malik Nabers (knee), and while tight ends Theo Johnson (6-33-2 on seven targets) and Daniel Bellinger (4-52-0 on four targets) saw more volume than usual, Robinson was able to get his share of those short passes as well. The veteran slot receiver has caught multiple passes in four of five games so far in 2025, posting a 23-267-1 line on 34 targets, and he should continue to have a solid PPR floor given the team’s lack of other receiving options. However, Robinson may not have much of a ceiling in a Week 6 clash with the Eagles.</p> <h4 id="aaron-rodgers-qb">Aaron Rodgers (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Steelers played from ahead for most of the game, so Rodgers attempted only eight passes in the second half. He managed to move the offense efficiently when asked, however, with the key to his day being an explosive 80-yard touchdown to DK Metcalf early in the second quarter. This was a return to form for Rodgers, as he had only a 3:3 TD:INT while combining to throw for 332 yards across his last two games. Pittsburgh is likely to continue to rely on its run game and short passes to move the offense, which will lead to inconsistent fantasy results for Rodgers.</p> <h4 id="mike-evans-wr">Mike Evans (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Out <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> out</p> <h4 id="baker-mayfield-qb">Baker Mayfield (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Mayfield flirted with perfection in a masterful performance that saw him miss just four pass attempts while committing zero turnovers. The 30-year-old was especially sharp in the clutch when he led a pair of five-play drives that took up a little over one minute of game clock to give Tampa Bay the 10 points needed to secure victory. The loss of star WR Mike Evans (hamstring) hasn’t hampered Mayfield and the passing offense, as the signal-caller is averaging 334.0 passing yards with a pair of touchdowns in the two games sans Evans. Mayfield will look to build off of the momentum of his cleanest outing when the Buccaneers host the 49ers next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="tyler-lockett-wr">Tyler Lockett (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> There were some positives to take away from the performance, as Lockett logged a season-high 74 percent of offensive snaps and drew four targets for the second consecutive game. However, he was unable to connect with Cam Ward, who has struggled in his first four starts as a pro. Like nearly every Titans’ pass catcher, Lockett is an unreliable fantasy option.</p> <h4 id="jayden-daniels-qb">Jayden Daniels (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Daniels returned from a two-week absence due to a knee injury in order to lead his team to its third win of the season. The 24-year-old was sporting a brace on his left knee, but it did not appear to limit the quarterback’s mobility on any of his eight carries Sunday. Daniels is averaging 221.3 passing yards and 41.3 rushing yards with four touchdowns to no interceptions in three 2025 starts. The dual-threat sophomore could be primed for his finest fantasy outing under the bright lights of Monday Night Football in Week 6 when the Commanders host a Bears defense that is surrendering 389.0 yards of offense to opponents this season.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_5_2025_KTT_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_5_2025_KTT_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week5"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Michael’s Managable Team Week 5 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-5-MMT/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Michael’s Managable Team Week 5 Report"/><published>2025-10-07T11:59:52+00:00</published><updated>2025-10-07T11:59:52+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-5-MMT</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-5-MMT/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Michael’s Managable Team Lost against Game of Zones - House Hamlin 119.91-122.87<br/> Current Standing: #4<br/> Playoff Chances: 61.2%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 84.2%<br/> Best Performer: Jake Ferguson (22.15 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="khalil-shakir-wr">Khalil Shakir (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Shakir matched his season high of nine targets, though he wasn’t able to turn that into much production. Four of his six catches went for six or fewer yards, leading to his third performance with less than 50 receiving yards on the campaign. Shakir will continue to be a key part of the Buffalo offense, but he’s reliant primarily on yards after the catch or touchdowns for big fantasy performances, with the majority of his opportunity coming in the short areas of the field.</p> <h4 id="harold-fannin-jr-te">Harold Fannin Jr. (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Fannin had a mixed performance in Dillon Gabriel’s first game under center. He was overshadowed by David Njoku – who led the team with nine targets – but was a reliable short-area target for Gabriel. Fannin accounted for the Browns’ first touchdown of the day with a one-yard catch midway through the first quarter, also the first of his career. He hasn’t shown much upside, but Fannin could emerge as a favorite target of Gabriel in the quick-pass game.</p> <h4 id="jake-ferguson-te">Jake Ferguson (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Dak Prescott continues to lean heavily on the tight end while CeeDee Lamb (ankle) is sidelined. Ferguson was on the other end of two of the QB’s four TD passes on the afternoon, hitting paydirt on a 26-yard strike and a one-yard toss in the second quarter as the Cowboys built a 23-3 lead before halftime. Over three games since Lamb went down, Ferguson has compiled a 27-171-3 line on 30 targets, and his seven receptions Sunday were a team high. He’ll look to keep rolling in Week 6 against the Panthers.</p> <h4 id="george-pickens-wr">George Pickens (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The game was more lopsided than the final score might suggest – Dallas took a 30-6 lead into the fourth quarter – and Pickens wasn’t needed for much volume as a result. He made his few looks count, however, burning Sauce Gardner for a 43-yard TD in the third quarter. Since CeeDee Lamb (ankle) got hurt early in Week 3, Pickens has erupted for a 15-259-4 line on 24 targets as Dak Prescott’s most dangerous downfield threat. Whether he’s able to continue that hot streak in Week 6 against the Panthers may depend largely on Lamb’s health.</p> <h4 id="jahmyr-gibbs-rb">Jahmyr Gibbs (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Gibbs has showcased his versatility in the Lions’ offense in the last two games, primarily working as a rusher in Week 4 before being excellent as a pass catcher in Sunday’s win. His touchdown came on an impressive 20-yard yard catch and run on a quick screen, during which he weaved through traffic before barreling through several players to reach the end zone. David Montgomery saw the majority of work in the fourth quarter with Detroit in control of the game, but Gibbs has still found the end zone in four straight games while surpassing 85 scrimmage yards in each of those contests.</p> <h4 id="woody-marks-rb">Woody Marks (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Marks rotated within drives with Nick Chubb for most of the game, but he still ended up with four fewer carries. Neither back was able to get much going, and three of Marks’ seven carries went for one yard or less. While it was a disappointing follow-up to what appeared to be a breakout performance in Week 5, game script didn’t help as Houston pulled most of its offensive starters early in the fourth quarter.</p> <h4 id="michael-pittman-jr-wr">Michael Pittman Jr. (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The veteran receiver finished second on the Colts in receptions during the lopsided victory, and although he averaged only 7.8 yards per catch, he rounded out his production nicely with a four-yard scoring grab late in the first half. Pittman has at least five receptions in four of the first five contests of the season, and although he continues to be used primarily in a short-area role, he’s already recorded four touchdown catches, one more than he tallied across 16 regular-season games in 2024. Pittman will look to continue adding to that total in a Week 6 home matchup against the Cardinals.</p> <h4 id="daniel-jones-qb">Daniel Jones (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Jones’ solid, efficient stat line was a fitting microcosm of what’s come to define his body of work early in his Colts tenure, as the veteran signal-caller once again turned in a mistake-free effort that complemented the exploits of Jonathan Taylor and the defense perfectly. Jones worked with a tight circle of five targets overall, tossing his pair of touchdowns to Tyler Warren (11 yards) and Michael Pittman (four yards). Jones has completed a sharp 71.3 percent of his passes and posted a 6:2 TD:INT through his first five games at the helm of Indianapolis’ offense, and he’s added another three scores on the ground. Jones next takes aim at the Cardinals’ defense in a Week 6 home clash.</p> <h4 id="bhayshul-tuten-rb">Bhayshul Tuten (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Tuten has had his practice reps managed in each of the last three weeks of game prep, but he’s still been available to the Jaguars offense on game days. While Travis Etienne has been a workhorse out of the backfield this season, Tuten has received regular touches, turning 21 carries into 88 yards and one touchdown and three catches (on four targets) for 40 yards and another score through four contests.</p> <h4 id="tre-harris-wr">Tre’ Harris (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Harris actually saw a season high in terms of snap percentage, but the extra work didn’t get the rookie more opportunities. The Chargers could be in a few more favorable passing game scripts with the offensive line in tatters due to injuries, but it has yet to significantly unlock the 2025 second-round pick.</p> <h4 id="justin-herbert-qb">Justin Herbert (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Herbert did not look comfortable in the pocket without starting left tackle Joe Alt (ankle) on Sunday, finishing below 200 yards passing for the first time this season. The 27-year-old was sacked four times while throwing his fourth interception of the season, all of which have come during his current three-game skid. Things got so bad that head coach Jim Harbaugh turned to backup QB Trey Lance in garbage time of Sunday’s loss. Herbert did salvage his fantasy day a bit by providing managers with a season high of 60 yards on the ground. The talented signal-caller will attempt to get his season back on track against the fledgling Dolphins next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="davante-adams-wr">Davante Adams (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Adams edged Puka Nacua by three for the team lead in receiving yards, and he was one target behind his teammate for the top spot in that category as well. Adams’ yardage and target tallies were also his best since Week 2 and second highest of the campaign in both cases. Nacua remains the clear alpha option in the Rams’ air attack, but Adams’ role as the No. 2 receiver is just as clearly delineated heading into a Week 6 road matchup against the Ravens on Sunday, Oct. 12.</p> <h4 id="tj-hockenson-te">T.J. Hockenson (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The veteran tight end continued to play a short-area role and finished as the runner-up in receptions for the Vikings while also tying for second in targets. Hockenson provided some key contributions on the Vikings’ game-winning drive late in the fourth quarter, making two catches for 20 yards during the possession. He has between four and six receptions in his last three games, but he’s yet to top 49 receiving yards in any contest this season heading into the Week 6 bye.</p> <h4 id="drake-maye-qb">Drake Maye (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Maye continued his impressive development in Week 5 despite failing to score a touchdown for the first time this season. The sophomore signal-caller did the dirty work between the 20s, leading a pair of lengthy drives in the second half that RB Rhamondre Stevenson finished off with short rushing scores. Maye is completing an impressive 73.9 percent of his pass attempts through five starts, leading New England to a surprising 3-2 start to the campaign. The North Carolina product should continue offering starter-level production in fantasy in a road tilt against the Saints next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="alvin-kamara-rb">Alvin Kamara (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The 55 scrimmage yards were a season low for Kamara, and it’s the third time in five games to begin the season that he’s failed to reach 60. The veteran back is struggling to make an impact, as defenses haven’t had much reason to fear the Saints’ passing attack, but they could begin to loosen up for Kamara after QB Spencer Rattler hit Rashid Shaheed for an 87-yard TD in Sunday’s win. Kamara will try to rebound in Week 6 against the Patriots.</p> <h4 id="ricky-pearsall-wr">Ricky Pearsall (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Out <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> out</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_5_2025_MMT_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_5_2025_MMT_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week5"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Americas Team Week 5 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-5-RRT/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Americas Team Week 5 Report"/><published>2025-10-07T11:59:52+00:00</published><updated>2025-10-07T11:59:52+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-5-RRT</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-5-RRT/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Americas Team Won against Abbey’s TNT Team 178.27-145.70<br/> Current Standing: #8<br/> Playoff Chances: 39.3%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 91.4%<br/> Best Performer: Sam Darnold (43.64 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="trey-mcbride-te">Trey McBride (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Cardinals’ offense completely stalled in the second half, with Kyler Murray throwing for only 78 yards in the final two quarters. That led to a muted stat line for McBride, who still led the team in targets and was tied for the lead in receptions. However, his longest catch of the day went for only 12 yards, and he’s now been held below 55 yards in each of his last three games.</p> <h4 id="deandre-hopkins-wr">DeAndre Hopkins (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Hopkins was a complete non-factor Sunday, failing to record a single catch while playing just 18 of the Ravens’ 54 offensive snaps. The veteran wideout’s one target was his lowest total of the season after seeing two targets in each of the first three games. Despite his stature as a five-time Pro Bowl selection, Hopkins isn’t seeing consistent enough volume to be relied to be relied upon for fantasy purposes.</p> <h4 id="chuba-hubbard-rb">Chuba Hubbard (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Out <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> out</p> <h4 id="jamarr-chase-wr">Ja’Marr Chase (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Chase and the entire Bengals’ offense got off to a slow start, as he had only four catches on eight targets for 31 yards at halftime. That changed quickly in the final two quarters, as Chase took his two targets for 15- and 64-yard touchdowns. The latter was particularly impressive, as he beat Amik Robertson on a double move to get wide open behind the defense. Chase’s weekly outlook is hurt by the subpar play of Jake Browning, though Chase is talented enough to overcome the poor offensive environment and showcased that ability in Sunday’s loss.</p> <h4 id="david-montgomery-rb">David Montgomery (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Montgomery made his initial impact in the game as a passer, taking a direct snap and delivering a three-yard touchdown pass to Brock Wright early in the second quarter. He got going as a rusher in the second half, racking up 12 carries for 62 yards – highlighted by an eight-yard touchdown run midway through the third quarter. While it wasn’t his most efficient performance, Montgomery bounced back from a poor Week 4 showing while logging a season-high 18 carries.</p> <h4 id="dalton-schultz-te">Dalton Schultz (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Schultz was C.J. Stroud’s favorite target in the first half, recording four receptions on four targets for 53 yards. Schultz played a key role on multiple scoring drives for Houston, recording 11- and 12-yard receptions to keep a pair of possessions alive on third down before logging a 21-yard catch to set up a touchdown just before halftime. This was Schultz’s highest yardage total of the season, and he has five receptions in three consecutive contests.</p> <h4 id="josh-downs-wr">Josh Downs (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> On a day when Daniel Jones spread the ball around in customary fashion, Downs’ six receptions qualified as a team-high figure. The third-year wideout’s yardage tally was also a new season high, although as his 9.0 yards per reception corroborates, Downs continues to be utilized almost exclusively in a short-area role. While his upside remains capped as a result, Downs particularly holds appeal in PPR formats heading into a Week 6 home matchup against the Cardinals next Sunday afternoon.</p> <h4 id="travis-etienne-jr-rb">Travis Etienne Jr. (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Etienne logged his lowest carry total of the campaign, which also led to a new low-water mark in rushing yards. The talented back also failed to record a double-digit-yardage run for the first time in five contests, but he reemerged in the passing game to an extent after mustering just a single reception for one yard on four targets in the previous pair of contests. Etienne draws another challenging matchup when the Seahawks pay a visit for a Week 6 interconference matchup Sunday afternoon.</p> <h4 id="matthew-stafford-qb">Matthew Stafford (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Stafford averaged an impressive 8.3 yards per attempt and facilitated four tallies of over 65 receiving yards for his arsenal of pass catchers. The veteran signal-caller connected with Kyren Williams (14 and eight yards) and Puka Nacua (one yard) for his trio of scoring tosses, his second consecutive such tally and fourth straight of multiple TD passes. Stafford’s last two games have seen him put the ball up over 40 times apiece, which is a significant departure from his first three contests of the campaign when he averaged 31.6 pass attempts per contest. Stafford will next take aim at an injury-ravaged Ravens defense in a Week 6 road matchup on Sunday, Oct. 12.</p> <h4 id="rhamondre-stevenson-rb">Rhamondre Stevenson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Stevenson led New England’s three-headed backfield with his seven carries Sunday, rewarding fantasy managers with a pair of trips to the end zone. The bad news for the veteran rusher was that his ball security woes continued with his third lost fumble in as many games. Stevenson’s case of fumblitis didn’t cost his team a shot at victory like it did in Week 3 against the Steelers. That said, it wouldn’t be surprising if the Patriots lean more heavily on TreVeyon Henderson and Antonio Gibson going forward if Stevenson is unable to correct his turnover issues.</p> <h4 id="spencer-rattler-qb">Spencer Rattler (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The second-year QB led the Saints to their first win of the season with another relatively quiet, but turnover-free, performance. Rattler was able to pick his spots against a poor Giants secondary, connecting with Rashid Shaheed on an 87-yard catch-and-run TD in the second quarter. Rattler doesn’t appear to be in much danger of losing his starting job to rookie Tyler Shough despite the team’s 1-4 record, posting a 6:1 TD:INT and 67.2 percent completion rate, albeit with a poor 5.6 YPA. He’ll look to build on this performance in Week 6 against the Patriots.</p> <h4 id="aj-brown-wr">A.J. Brown (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Brown finished second in receptions and third in targets during a busy day for the Eagles’ passing attack, but he averaged just 8.6 yards per grab against Denver’s tough defense. Brown’s reception and receiving yardage tallies were his second highest of the season, but through five games, he has just a single touchdown catch and only one game of more than 43 receiving yards as well. Brown won’t have to wait long for his next opportunity to put an end to that unfavorable trend, as he draws a favorable Week 6 road matchup against the Giants on Thursday night.</p> <h4 id="brian-robinson-jr-rb">Brian Robinson Jr. (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Starter Christian McCaffrey gobbled up a season high 76 snaps on offense (88 percent) Thursday, leaving just scraps for Robinson, even with the 49ers missing several key offensive players on a short week. The veteran backup finished with his worst per-carry average (2.4 yards) since being traded to San Francisco this preseason. Robinson’s lack of involvement in the passing game (three targets) coupled with zero trips to the end zone through five appearances make him a poor fantasy option Week 6 against the Buccaneers.</p> <h4 id="cooper-kupp-wr">Cooper Kupp (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Kupp produced his second-best receiving line as a member of the Seahawks while finishing in a tie with Jaxon Smith-Njigba for the team lead in targets (nine) Sunday. The 32-year-old Kupp was held out of the end zone for the fifth time in as many games this season, resulting in a useful PPR score and not much else. The former Los Angeles Ram has carved out a decent role as the Seahawks’ No. 2 receiver, but he lacks the upside that once made him a must-start option in fantasy. Kupp’s upside is capped as a flex option for a Week 6 matchup against the Jaguars.</p> <h4 id="sam-darnold-qb">Sam Darnold (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Darnold’s untimely interception in the closing moments of Sunday’s narrow loss could not erase the gaudy passing numbers he provided fantasy managers Sunday. It was the 28-year-old’s first start this season eclipsing the 300-yard mark in passing, and the most comfortable he has looked running Seattle’s offense through five starts. Darnold will attempt to combine strong results with a Seahawks win in a road matchup against the Jaguars next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="jaxon-smith-njigba-wr">Jaxon Smith-Njigba (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Smith-Njigba put it all together with his first game of the season recording 100 or more yards while also nabbing a touchdown. The outpouring of fantasy production was a welcome sight after the star receiver experienced a gradual reduction in targets from the high-water mark of 13 he set back in Week 1. JSN bumped his receiving line up to 34-534-2 through five appearances as he settles in as QB Sam Darnold’s most-trusted option in the passing game. Managers can start Smith-Njigba with confidence heading into a Week 6 road matchup against the Jaguars next Sunday.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_5_2025_RRT_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_5_2025_RRT_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week5"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry></feed>
