</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="lamar-jackson-qb">Lamar Jackson (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Jackson was nearly flawless commanding the Ravens‚Äô offense on Sunday Night Football, but it wasn‚Äôt enough to lift his team over the Bills in an instant classic. The 28-year-old was able to help fantasy managers with his three combined touchdowns, a mark he reached an impressive nine times in 2024. Those who spent a premium pick on the dual-threat superstar have to be feeling good about their QB heading into the Ravens‚Äô home opener against the Browns next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="joe-flacco-qb">Joe Flacco (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Browns played at a methodical pace and prioritized passes to the short areas of the field early in the game, with Flacco attempting 15 passes for 87 yards by halftime. He opened things up in the second half, when he accounted for his longest completions of the game (25, 25 and 22 yards). Flacco‚Äôs lone touchdown of the game came on the opening drive of the third quarter, when he connected with Cedric Tillman from five yards away. Things turned quickly, however, as he threw an interception that set up the game-winning field goal for Cincinnati on the following drive.</p> <h4 id="quinshon-judkins-rb">Quinshon Judkins (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Out <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Judkins finally put pen to paper on his rookie contract with the Browns on Saturday, but because he missed all of training camp and preseason while he was unsigned following his July 12 arrest in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. on charges of domestic assault and battery, Cleveland was granted a two-game exemption in which the running back won‚Äôt count toward the 53-man roster. Though all charges against Judkins have since been dropped, the NFL is still investigating the alleged incident, and the 21-year-old is scheduled to meet with league officials during the upcoming week. While it‚Äôs still unclear if Judkins will be subject to any league discipline, the expectation is that he‚Äôll have the roster exemption lifted in advance of the Week 2 contest. Because of all the time he‚Äôs missed this summer, Judkins could handle a light role initially for Cleveland, though Cameron Wolfe of NFL Network relays that the Browns are hopeful that Judkins will eventually emerge as the team‚Äôs lead back. Dylan Sampson and Jerome Ford will take on the brunt of the snaps and touches out of the backfield for at least the Week 1 game, however.</p> <h4 id="marvin-mims-jr-wr">Marvin Mims Jr. (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Mims was able to suit up after practicing all week while recovering from a thigh injury. Managers may have hoped he sat this one out after a lost fumble resulted in a negative fantasy score in standard formats. Courtland Sutton (6-61-1) and Troy Franklin (4-44-0) finished with more targets and better production than Mims. The 23-year-old Mims will have to step it up, starting with next Sunday‚Äôs matchup against the Colts, or run the risk of falling down the receiver depth chart.</p> <h4 id="jameson-williams-wr">Jameson Williams (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Williams‚Äô primary appeal as a fantasy contributor is his ability to hit for explosive plays, but the Packers held him under wraps in Week 1. His longest reception went for just 11 yards, and he was held to his lowest yardage total in a regular-season game since Week 7 of the 2024 campaign. The entire Lions‚Äô offense was ineffective, so it‚Äôs not time to panic on Williams heading into a Week 2 matchup against the Bears.</p> <h4 id="nico-collins-wr">Nico Collins (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Houston‚Äôs entire aerial attack sputtered out of the gates, failing to produce any touchdowns or a receiver with more than 32 yards. Collins‚Äô receiving line marks the wideout‚Äôs worst fantasy output since Week 14 of the 2023 season. This was not the kind of start fantasy managers were hoping for from the unquestioned No. 1 receiving option for the Texans. Perhaps the eventual return of Christian Kirk (hamstring) will help open things up for C.J. Stroud and the rest of the passing game following an abysmal Week 1 performance. Collins is too talented to be held down on a regular basis, so make sure to stick with your studs heading into next Monday‚Äôs tilt against the Buccaneers.</p> <h4 id="brock-bowers-te">Brock Bowers (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Per Pelissero, Bowers indicated afterward that he‚Äôs fine, with the tight end noting that he took a little hit on his knee (which he got checked out ) and that there are no concerns moving forward. Meanwhile, Vincent Bonsignore of the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports that Bowers wanted to return to Sunday‚Äôs game, but the Raiders‚Äô training staff elected to hold him out. In any case, added context regarding Bowers‚Äô Week 2 status will arrive no later than Thursday, when Las Vegas takes the practice field ahead of next Monday‚Äôs contest against the Chargers.</p> <h4 id="jaylen-waddle-wr">Jaylen Waddle (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Waddle‚Äôs quiet final line represented the collateral damage caused by an ugly performance from Tua Tagovailoa, who turned the ball over three times while managed just 114 passing yards overall. Waddle finished tied with Tyreek Hill for the team lead in receptions and also drew even with Malik Washington for runner-up status in targets, but it was naturally a very underwhelming day overall for the star receiver. The entire Dolphins air attack will aim for a reset in a Week 2 home matchup against the Patriots on Sunday, Sept. 14.</p> <h4 id="tua-tagovailoa-qb">Tua Tagovailoa (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> In a harbinger of the type of game it would be for the Dolphins offense and Tagovailoa in particular, the 2020 first-round pick sailed a pass intended for Tyreek Hill very high on the opening drive, leading to an interception by Camryn Bynum. The veteran signal-caller then handed the ball to the Colts again on the next possession, losing a fumble recovered by former teammate Xavien Howard. Tagovailoa would go on to short-circuit another possession with a third-quarter interception in Indianapolis territory, and only his 11-yard touchdown pass to De‚ÄôVon Achane and subsequent two-point conversion pass to Julian Hill in the fourth quarter gave the signal-caller‚Äôs fantasy day any semblance of respectability. Tagovailoa‚Äôs first opportunity for atonement comes in a Week 2 home matchup next Sunday against a Patriots defense that allowed 362 yards to the Raiders‚Äô Geno Smith in Week 1 while playing without Christian Gonzalez (hamstring).</p> <h4 id="jordan-mason-rb">Jordan Mason (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Mason comfortably led the Vikings in rush attempts and rushing yards, outpacing the only other running back to log a carry, Aaron Jones, by seven carries and 45 yards. The Week 1 usage between the two players is eye-catching to say the least, considering Jones is the established incumbent of the ground attack under a returning coaching staff. Nevertheless, Mason is a proven commodity as an offseason addition, and head coach Kevin O‚ÄôConnell may be most comfortable affording the latter the bulk of early-down work on most weeks. The next opportunity to see how the pecking order shakes out comes in a Week 2 home matchup against the Falcons on Sunday night.</p> <h4 id="adam-thielen-wr">Adam Thielen (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Per Pelissero, Thielen volunteered to take less money in order to help the Vikings clear cap space and improve their chances of competing. It‚Äôs another indication that Thielen is thrilled to be back in Minnesota after two campaigns with Carolina. The Panthers dealt Thielen to the Vikings on Thursday, and the veteran wideout‚Äôs presence should help Minnesota absorb the early-season suspension of Jordan Addison, who won‚Äôt be available until Week 4.</p> <h4 id="garrett-wilson-wr">Garrett Wilson (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Wilson put the Jets in front with a 33-yard touchdown catch in the first quarter, and he came two yards from the end zone again on a 21-yard catch in the third, leading to a Justin Fields rushing score on the next play. He was the clear top option in the passing game, as Breece Hall was a distant second in both targets (four) and receiving yards (38), but Wilson will regret his inability to hold onto the ball on the Jets‚Äô final offensive play, as Jalen Ramsey dislodged the ball from his hands on fourth down, preventing what would have been a game-extending catch. With Wilson showing strong chemistry with Fields, the talented wide receiver should remain a strong fantasy option against the Bills in Week 2.</p> <h4 id="jaylen-warren-rb">Jaylen Warren (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Warren led the Steelers‚Äô backfield as expected, though he only out-carried Kenneth Gainwell 11-7. He had a disastrous first half, recording just four carries for nine yards, but he managed to make an impact in the second half with a long reception of 17 yards late in the third quarter, and he later capped the same drive with a five-yard touchdown catch. Warren managed a decent fantasy performance all told, but he may be reliant on big plays and touchdowns rather than volume, even as the lead back in Pittsburgh.</p> <h4 id="jauan-jennings-wr">Jauan Jennings (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Coach Kyle Shanahan noted Monday that Jennings‚Äô initial test looked okay, but there are still more results to come. The wideout‚Äôs status thus is worth monitoring in the days ahead, but at this stage Shanahan believes that Jennings has a chance to play Sunday against the Saints, Jennifer Lee Chan of NBC Sports Bay Area reports. With Brandon Aiyuk (knee) still on the reserve/PUP list, Jennings now banged-up and Jordan Watkins dealing with an ankle injury, Ricky Pearsall currently is the 49ers‚Äô top healthy WR, a context that could lead to some combo of Marquez Valdes-Scantling, Russell Gage, Kendrick Bourne and Skyy Moore seeing added opportunities Week 2.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_1_2025_90s_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_1_2025_90s_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week1"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Abbey‚Äôs TNT Team Week 1 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-1-ARV/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Abbey‚Äôs TNT Team Week 1 Report"/><published>2025-09-09T14:59:56+00:00</published><updated>2025-09-09T14:59:56+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-1-ARV</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-1-ARV/"><![CDATA[<pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="bijan-robinson-rb">Bijan Robinson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> As his final line indicates, Robinson was completely stonewalled on the ground by a typically stout Buccaneers run defense. However, the versatile running back made his mark through the air and wasted no time doing so, capping off the game‚Äôs opening possession with a weaving 50-yard touchdown reception. Robinson would go on to compile exactly that same amount of yardage on his subsequent five receptions, just getting to his second career 100-yard game as a receiver. Better days are naturally ahead for Robinson as a runner as well, and despite the lack of rushing production Sunday, his 18 total touches certainly represent a solid start to his season from a fantasy perspective. Robinson next takes aim at the Vikings defense on the road in a Sunday night Week 2 matchup.</p> <h4 id="xavier-legette-wr">Xavier Legette (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The second-year wideout saw a solid share of Bryce Young‚Äôs attention, but rookie Tetairoa McMillan was the Panthers‚Äô clear top option in the passing game, and Legette‚Äôs longest gain went for just nine yards. After an inconsistent rookie season in 2024, Carolina is hoping Legette can take a step forward as a sophomore, but this wasn‚Äôt an encouraging performance from the 32nd overall pick in last year‚Äôs draft. He‚Äôll look to deliver a more efficient effort on the road in Week 2 against the Cardinals.</p> <h4 id="dylan-sampson-rb">Dylan Sampson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Sampson was expected to serve as the change-of-pace back in Cleveland, but he took the first carry for the Browns and out-touched Jerome Ford 20-7. Sampson wasn‚Äôt particularly impressive on the ground, but he was still more efficient than Ford. He ultimately made his mark as a pass catcher, however, as he led the Browns in receptions (eight) and was second in yards (64). While it was an encouraging debut for Sampson, the backfield is likely to grow more crowded with the addition of Quinshon Judkins in Week 2 against Baltimore.</p> <h4 id="jaydon-blue-rb">Jaydon Blue (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong></p> <h4 id="bo-nix-qb">Bo Nix (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Nix entered 2025 with high expectations after closing the 2024 season with multiple passing touchdowns in seven of his last eight regular-season games. He couldn‚Äôt carry that momentum into a home matchup against a Titans‚Äô defense that is projected to be below-average, as he averaged only 4.4 yards per attempt while throwing a pair of picks on ill-advised throws. Nix did manage a 22-yard touchdown pass to Courtland Sutton just before halftime, but this wasn‚Äôt the start he hoped for to begin his sophomore campaign.</p> <h4 id="kalif-raymond-wr">Kalif Raymond (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Raymond was pretty much an afterthought on offense in Week 1, garnering just three looks from quarterback Jared Goff, which ranked sixth on the team. The wide receiver is firmly behind Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jameson Williams on the depth chart, while rookie Isaac TeSlaa figures to see a larger role as the season goes on. Raymond remains more of a special-teams asset than an offensive weapon as the 2025 campaign has gotten underway.</p> <h4 id="geno-smith-qb">Geno Smith (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The veteran signal-caller looked right at home in a Raiders uniform from the opening possession, which he capped off with perfect 26-yard scoring strike to Tre Tucker. While that would be Smith‚Äôs only touchdown toss of the game, he would pile up a fantasy-friendly yardage total by connecting with seven different pass catchers, including a trio of rookies in Dont‚Äôe Thornton, Jack Bech and Ashton Jeanty. Smith also displayed excellent chemistry with star tight end Brock Bowers, but the latter notably exited the game in the second half with a knee injury. Tom Pelissero of NFL Network reports Bowers downplayed the injury after the contest and stated he wanted to return to the game, so Smith appears to have a good chance of having access to his top target for a Week 2 AFC West home showdown against the Chargers on Monday night, Sept. 15.</p> <h4 id="kyren-williams-rb">Kyren Williams (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> It wasn‚Äôt the most efficient of games from Williams, but he rewarded fantasy managers with the only rushing score of the contest from either side. Another positive takeaway was the backfield touch distribution, with backup RB Blake Corum poaching just two touches from the starter all game. Williams entered this year‚Äôs drafts as a safe RB1 option, and Sunday‚Äôs results only confirm that status moving forward. Look for the Notre Dame product to continue dominating the backfield touches in a road matchup against the Titans next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="puka-nacua-wr">Puka Nacua (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Nacua took a hit to the helmet at the end of a nine-yard catch on the Rams‚Äô second possession that caused a notable cut on his forehead. He was deemed questionable to return as he underwent a concussion check, but before getting back on the field, he was seen with a bandage over the wound, per Greg Beacham of the Associated Press. Nacua will look to build upon the three catches (on four targets) for 23 yards that he put up prior to his earlier exit.</p> <h4 id="tyreek-hill-wr">Tyreek Hill (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Hill finished as the co-leader in receptions and set the pace in receiving yards, but on a day when Tua Tagovailoa threw for only 114 yards, tossed two interceptions and took three sacks, those team-leading numbers weren‚Äôt exactly noteworthy. The veteran speedster entered Week 1 with at least some mild questions surrounding his fantasy outlook; however, Hill appeared to maximize his opportunities in a negative game environment Sunday, and he could be in line for a boost in production in a Week 2 home matchup against a Patriots defense that gave up 362 passing yards to the Raiders‚Äô Geno Smith in Week 1.</p> <h4 id="tank-bigsby-rb">Tank Bigsby (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Bigsby took a back seat to Travis Etienne in Week 1, getting outsnapped 40-14 (out of 66 on offense) and outtouched 19-5. All of Bigsby‚Äôs touches were carries for a measly 12 yards, while Etienne ripped off 156 yards from scrimmage. With this move to Philadelphia, Bigsby may be able to join the RB mix right away after backup Will Shipley suffered a rib injury last Thursday against the Cowboys, but this is still Saquon Barkley‚Äôs backfield, and veteran AJ Dillon also is on hand. More than likely, Bigsby‚Äôs immediate impact will occur on kick returns.</p> <h4 id="cade-otton-te">Cade Otton (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> After managing to head into the weekend without an injury designation following weeks of dealing with leg and groin issues, Otton wasn‚Äôt able to get on the stat sheet for the first time since Week 2 of last season. Despite the blanking Sunday, Otton will naturally make a much bigger impact on the stat sheet in the majority of games this season, potentially beginning with a Week 2 road showdown against the Texans on Monday night, Sept. 15.</p> <h4 id="emeka-egbuka-wr">Emeka Egbuka (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The rookie first-round pick had been ascendant since he first stepped on a Buccaneers practice field this offseason, and Egbuka delivered handsomely in his first career regular-season contest. The Ohio State product first struck from 30-yards out just past the midway point of the second quarter, and he subsequently added what would turn out to be a game-winning 25-yard scoring grab with just under a minute remaining. The poise and polish that Egbuka has repeatedly been commended for was on display on his way to a team-leading yardage total, and he‚Äôll be in line to play another significant role during a Week 2 marquee interconference road matchup against the Texans on Monday night, Sept. 15.</p> <h4 id="calvin-ridley-wr">Calvin Ridley (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Ridley led the Titans in targets and receptions, but he was not efficient with his chances and was slightly out of sync with Cameron Ward. The duo connected for a 13-yard gain early in the fourth quarter, Ridley‚Äôs longest catch of the day. However, he had a few passes glance off his hands later in the contest as the Titans tried to mount a comeback, and Ridley had a particularly costly drop on the team‚Äôs final offensive possession. While it was a disappointing opening line, Ridley should be in for better performances moving forward thanks to his secure role in the Titans‚Äô offense.</p> <h4 id="deebo-samuel-wr">Deebo Samuel (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Samuel gave the Commanders some breathing room with a 19-yard rushing touchdown in the fourth quarter to extend Washington‚Äôs lead to 21-6. He also led the team in targets, catches and receiving yards, while no teammate had more than five targets, three catches or 34 receiving yards. Samuel‚Äôs set to be a key playmaker for the Commanders after coming over from San Francisco in an offseason trade. Up next for Samuel is a Week 2 trip to Green Bay on Thursday.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_1_2025_ARV_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_1_2025_ARV_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week1"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Big Titi Energy Week 1 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-1-BTE/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Big Titi Energy Week 1 Report"/><published>2025-09-09T14:59:56+00:00</published><updated>2025-09-09T14:59:56+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-1-BTE</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-1-BTE/"><![CDATA[<pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="dalton-kincaid-te">Dalton Kincaid (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Kincaid scored a 15-yard touchdown on the opening drive but was relatively quiet the rest of the way, especially considering Josh Allen ultimately threw for 394 yards. This was nonetheless an encouraging performance from Kincaid, who had only two regular-season touchdowns apiece in the 2023 and 2024 campaigns. Dawson Knox had two catches for 20 yards and rookie fifth-round pick Jackson Hawes also had a 29-yard catch, but Kincaid clearly looks like the top receiving option among Buffalo‚Äôs tight ends heading into Week 2 against the Jets.</p> <h4 id="dj-moore-wr">DJ Moore (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Moore stayed down after taking a big hit in the fourth quarter but eventually stayed in the game after talking to trainers, as evidenced by his fumble, which came as the Bears were attempting laterals on the game‚Äôs final play. He occasionally lined up in the backfield in addition to his customary role at wide receiver, so he may handle a few rushing attempts on a weekly basis moving forward. Moore led the Bears in receiving yards each of the past two seasons, so it‚Äôs no surprise that he topped that category for the team in Monday‚Äôs season opener. The 28-year-old wide receiver should remain heavily involved Week 2 against the Lions.</p> <h4 id="roschon-johnson-rb">Roschon Johnson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Johnson followed up Thursday‚Äôs listing of DNP on the Bears‚Äô practice estimate with no drills Friday before returning as a limited participant at Saturday‚Äôs session. A foot issue has been bothering him since at least Aug. 7, but the team gave him a chance to suit up in the season opener. With Johnson‚Äôs lack of availability confirmed for Week 1 action, rookie seventh-rounder Kyle Monangai will be the only active RB behind No. 1 option D‚ÄôAndre Swift.</p> <h4 id="tee-higgins-wr">Tee Higgins (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Cincinnati offense had a surprisingly poor opening performance against the Browns, leading to limited production for all of its skill-position players. Higgins led the team in receiving yards thanks to a 13-yard catch as well as a pair of 10-yard gains, but it was still a disappointing showing. He should remain a key part of Cincinnati‚Äôs offense and will have a chance to bounce back in Week 2 against the Jaguars.</p> <h4 id="jerome-ford-rb">Jerome Ford (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Ford was expected to serve as Cleveland‚Äôs lead back, but he was instead out-touched 20-7 by Dylan Sampson. Ford didn‚Äôt help himself with his opportunity, as he averaged only 1.3 yards per attempt, with his longest gain on the ground going for only two yards. Things aren‚Äôt likely to get better for Ford moving forward, as Quinshon Judkins is expected to join the backfield as soon as Week 2 against Baltimore.</p> <h4 id="christian-kirk-wr">Christian Kirk (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable</p> <h4 id="cj-stroud-qb">C.J. Stroud (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Stroud struggled to finish drives Sunday, leading three lengthy possessions that ended in field-goal attempts. A second-half interception cemented the signal-caller‚Äôs poor outing and a loss to begin the 2025 campaign. Stroud and his fantasy managers were hoping for a better start after the offense petered out down the stretch last season. Houston will have an extra day to figure things out offensively before hosting the Buccaneers on Monday Night Football in Week 2.</p> <h4 id="jj-mccarthy-qb">J.J. McCarthy (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Making his long-awaited regular-season debut, McCarthy mostly scuffled through the first three quarters before igniting a 21-point outburst in the final period. The 2024 first-round pick connected with Justin Jefferson and Aaron Jones for fourth-quarter touchdown passes of 13 and 27 yards, respectively, and he followed those scoring strikes with a 14-yard touchdown run to extend Minnesota‚Äôs 20-17 lead at the 2:53 mark of the fourth quarter. McCarthy also completed a two-point conversion to Adam Thielen, and he connected with seven different targets overall when factoring in that scoring toss. The second-year signal-caller now will prepare for his home regular-season debut, a Week 2 matchup against the Falcons on Sunday night.</p> <h4 id="demario-douglas-wr">DeMario Douglas (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Douglas‚Äô final receiving line was odd to say the least, considering he managed the unlikely feat of recording a touchdown yet finishing with negative yardage overall. The third-year pro saved his day from being a total washout with his two-yard scoring grab late in the first quarter, but the likes of Kayshon Boutte (6-103), Stefon Diggs (6-57) and Hunter Henry (4-66) were all much more involved. It remains to be seen if Week 1 usage will be indicative of a more concentrated Patriots air attack this season, with the next opportunity to see the matter play out coming in the form of a Week 2 road matchup against the Dolphins.</p> <h4 id="russell-wilson-qb">Russell Wilson (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Wilson struggled significantly in his New York debut versus the Commanders in Week 1, a 21-6 loss in which he completed 17 of 37 pass attempts for 168 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions. The veteran did salvage his fantasy performance to some extent, rushing for 44 yards on eight carries. While Daboll said the team doesn‚Äôt want to make any rash decisions at quarterback, Wilson will certainly need to turn in a better effort sooner rather than later in order to avoid pressure from rookie first-round pick Jaxson Dart or potentially even veteran backup Jameis Winston.</p> <h4 id="breece-hall-rb">Breece Hall (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Hall ripped off an 18-yard run on the game‚Äôs first play, setting the tone for a strong performance on the ground. He was also the team‚Äôs second-leading receiver behind Garrett Wilson. Braelon Allen had an eight-yard touchdown run but mustered only one yard on five other carries, so Hall‚Äôs the clear lead back for the Jets heading into a Week 2 home game against the Bills.</p> <h4 id="dallas-goedert-te">Dallas Goedert (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Goedert recorded a co-game-high reception total and was second on the Eagles in receiving yards on a night when Jalen Hurts threw for a modest 152 yards. The veteran tight end was peppered with a team-high target tally by Hurts as the Cowboys focused plenty of attention on A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith, leading to a productive start to the campaign for Goedert. He should be involved in a complementary capacity at minimum during a Week 2 road Super Bowl rematch with the Chiefs on Sunday, Sept. 14.</p> <h4 id="roman-wilson-wr">Roman Wilson (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Wilson had a minimal role for the Steelers when healthy in 2024, and he was utilized sparingly during Sunday‚Äôs regular-season opener, playing just 10 offensive snaps in the Steelers‚Äô victory. The 2024 third-round pick has yet to be targeted in the NFL, and he could have trouble carving out much fantasy production in 2025 as long as DK Metcalf and Calvin Austin remain healthy.</p> <h4 id="zach-charbonnet-rb">Zach Charbonnet (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Seahawks opened the 2025 season splitting backfield work between Kenneth Walker and Charbonnet. The latter wound up cashing in Seattle‚Äôs lone rushing touchdown and finishing with the superior fantasy line. Charbonnet already showed that he can handle an expanded role while filling in for Walker last season, so we could be witnessing the torch being passed to the younger option. Charbonnet provides more fantasy upside over Walker in a timeshare due to his durability and work in the passing game (52 targets in 2024).</p> <h4 id="kenneth-walker-iii-rb">Kenneth Walker III (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Walker was a limited participant in practice this week dealing with a minor foot injury, but he was left off the injury report ahead of Sunday‚Äôs kickoff. The veteran starter struggled to gain traction early, ceding 12 carries to Zach Charbonnet in a near-even split of touches. If a true timeshare has finally developed in Seattle, then Walker‚Äôs fantasy stock would take a hit after he commanded the lion‚Äôs share of carries when healthy in years past. Assuming this backfield deployment sticks, both tailbacks would generate flex appeal against the Steelers next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="terry-mclaurin-wr">Terry McLaurin (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Perhaps a lack of training camp reps due to an ankle injury and since-resolved contract dispute threw off McLaurin‚Äôs timing in the season opener, though he also got off to a slow start last season, with just 39 yards through Week 2. McLaurin will try to avoid the same fate Thursday when the Commanders travel to Green Bay. He had a boom-or-bust season in 2024, with four multi-touchdown performances in the regular season, as well as five games with fewer than 30 receiving yards.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_1_2025_BTE_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_1_2025_BTE_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week1"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Emma‚Äôs Excellent Team Week 1 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-1-EET/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Emma‚Äôs Excellent Team Week 1 Report"/><published>2025-09-09T14:59:56+00:00</published><updated>2025-09-09T14:59:56+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-1-EET</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-1-EET/"><![CDATA[<pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="trey-benson-rb">Trey Benson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The second-year back led Arizona in rushing thanks to a 52-yard scamper around right end on the team‚Äôs first drive of the second half. James Conner saw 12 carries but gained only 39 yards, with his longest run going for 12, and the split both of touches and of production bodes well for Benson as the season moves forward. He‚Äôll look to continue carving out a significant role in the offense at home Week 2 against the Panthers.</p> <h4 id="tyler-allgeier-rb">Tyler Allgeier (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The No. 2 back finished with just two fewer carries than star backfield mate Bijan Robinson, who was similarly stymied on the ground. However, Robinson also logged seven targets and finished with 100 receiving yards, while Allgeier did not see the ball come his way through the air. Robinson is expected to see an even bigger role in his third season, but Allgeier should still have at least an outside chance at double-digit carries in most games.</p> <h4 id="drake-london-wr">Drake London (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> As his final numbers corroborate, London had an exceedingly busy day in the season-opening division clash, but his absence on a drive that ended in a missed field goal by Younghoe Koo loomed large. London also was contained to plenty of short-area work when he was in the game, with the Buccaneers naturally having plenty of experience in defending him at this point in his career. London‚Äôs status for a Week 2 road matchup against the Vikings next Sunday night will remain clouded for now, but further clarity will be gleaned on his condition in the coming days.</p> <h4 id="justice-hill-rb">Justice Hill (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Hill had a healthy 45% snap share but his usage was minimal as he had just four combined opportunities in 23 snaps. He had a mishap on one of his carries that resulted in a fumble, and also had a target slip through his hands. Hill seems to be locked into a role as the passing down back who should see his share of targets as the season progresses ‚Äì he caught 42 passes in 2024 ‚Äì but rushing work will likely remain light. The Ravens host the Browns in Week 2.</p> <h4 id="dak-prescott-qb">Dak Prescott (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Prescott spearheaded the upset-minded Cowboys through a productive first two quarters that had Dallas up by a 14-7 margin at one point. The initial two drives culminated in Javonte Williams rushing touchdowns, and Prescott played mistake-free football while frequently focusing on top target CeeDee Lamb. However, Prescott and new addition George Pickens had some trouble connecting in their first game together ‚Äì albeit because of defensive pass interference in one instance ‚Äì and Lamb then failed to find the handle on a couple of the quarterback‚Äôs throws in the fourth quarter, including on a perfectly thrown fourth-down lob down the left side of the field that Lamb dove for but couldn‚Äôt secure. Prescott and Pickens will have some extra time to build chemistry ahead of the Cowboys‚Äô Week 2 game, which will be their home opener against the Giants on Sunday, Sept. 14.</p> <h4 id="courtland-sutton-wr">Courtland Sutton (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Sutton was unsurprisingly Bo Nix‚Äôs favorite target and led the Broncos in targets, receptions and yards. Sutton accounted for the majority of his production on a leaping, contested 22-yard touchdown catch just before halftime. He chipped in two additional receptions that went for double-digit gains to get his 2025 campaign off to a solid start.</p> <h4 id="hollywood-brown-wr">Hollywood Brown (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Brown led the Chiefs in receptions, receiving yards and targets, and Xavier Worthy‚Äôs exit from the game on the third play from scrimmage due to a shoulder injury certainly played a part in the former‚Äôs boost in opportunity. While Brown‚Äôs mostly short-area role left him just short of the 100-yard mark despite the significant catch volume, he did record a game-long 49-yard reception. Brown‚Äôs chemistry with Patrick Mahomes was certainly encouraging after the veteran wideout missed the majority of the 2024 regular season due to a sternoclavicular injury, and his hefty workload could come close to being replicated in a Super Bowl LIX home rematch with the Eagles on Sunday, Sept. 14 if Worthy is sidelined for that game.</p> <h4 id="jakobi-meyers-wr">Jakobi Meyers (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Facing his old squad, Meyers finished with team-leading reception and target totals while checking in just behind Brock Bowers (knee) in receiving yards. The veteran wideout displayed an encouraging rapport with new quarterback Geno Smith, and Meyers‚Äô final line was a signature one for a receiver that‚Äôs made his living in the league excelling in the short- and medium-range passing windows. Meyers should be very busy again during a Week 2 home divisional showdown with the Chargers on Monday night, Sept. 15.</p> <h4 id="darren-waller-te">Darren Waller (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable</p> <h4 id="rashid-shaheed-wr">Rashid Shaheed (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The fourth-year wideout saw strong volume in new coach Kellen Moore‚Äôs scheme, but Shaheed was actually the Saints‚Äô third-most productive pass catcher behind TE Juwan Johnson (8-76 on 11 targets) and WR Chris Olave (7-54 on 13 targets). With Spencer Rattler chucking up a career-high 46 pass attempts in a game that remained close throughout, the ceiling for the team‚Äôs aerial attack might be higher than expected despite the question marks at quarterback. Shaheed will look to turn his volume into a big gain or two at home in Week 2 against the 49ers.</p> <h4 id="tyrone-tracy-jr-rb">Tyrone Tracy Jr. (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Tracy failed to find any running room, though Devin Singletary and rookie fourth-round pick Cam Skattebo were even worse, with a combined six rushing yards on five carries. Poor offensive play could limit the Giants‚Äô offense all season, but Tracy at least looks like the team‚Äôs clear lead back to begin his second NFL season. Tracy will try to bounce back in Week 2 against the Cowboys.</p> <h4 id="brock-purdy-qb">Brock Purdy (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Coach Kyle Shanahan revealed Monday that Purdy suffered a pair of injuries during Sunday‚Äôs victory in Seattle. The toe issue is worse than the shoulder concern, per David Lombardi of SFStandard.com, which is to his non-throwing arm. Purdy was able to play all 76 offensive snaps and completed 26 of 35 passes for 277 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions and turned five carries into 17 yards. If Purdy needs to miss any time, Mac Jones is waiting in the wings for spot starts.</p> <h4 id="george-kittle-te">George Kittle (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Out <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Coach Kyle Shanahan relayed during Monday‚Äôs media session that Kittle was expected to miss a ‚Äúfew weeks,‚Äù according to David Lombardi of SFStandard.com. If the timeline that Rapoport put forth is more accurate, though, Kittle would be a candidate to be placed on injured reserve, which would require at least four games on the sideline. For as long as Kittle is out, Luke Farrell and Jake Tonges will serve as San Francisco‚Äôs tight ends.</p> <h4 id="tony-pollard-rb">Tony Pollard (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Pollard predictably dominated work out of the Tennessee backfield, accounting for 18 of the team‚Äôs 21 rushing attempts. He was unable to find much room to run, as he managed a long gain of only nine yards on the ground while averaging just 3.3 yards per attempt with a lost fumble. Pollard‚Äôs biggest impact of the game came on a 29-yard catch on Tennessee‚Äôs first possession that ultimately set up a field goal. While his stat line wasn‚Äôt particularly impressive, Pollard should have a very safe workload heading into a Week 2 matchup against the Rams.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_1_2025_EET_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_1_2025_EET_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week1"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Game of Zones - House Hamlin Week 1 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-1-HMB/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Game of Zones - House Hamlin Week 1 Report"/><published>2025-09-09T14:59:56+00:00</published><updated>2025-09-09T14:59:56+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-1-HMB</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-1-HMB/"><![CDATA[<pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="james-conner-rb">James Conner (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The veteran was bottled up at the line of scrimmage and watched second-year back Trey Benson break off a 52-yard gain to help him lead the Cardinals in rushing on the day, but Conner was able to make an impact with a four-yard TD catch on an underhand flip from Kyler Murray in the second quarter. Benson was expected to cut into Conner‚Äôs workload as the 2025 season progressed, but the split could tip even further in the youngster‚Äôs favor based on the duo‚Äôs Week 1 performances. Conner will look to reinforce his claim to the RB1 role at home Week 2 against the Panthers.</p> <h4 id="ray-ray-mccloud-iii-wr">Ray-Ray McCloud III (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Darnell Mooney (shoulder) was inactive, plus Drake London (shoulder) and Jamal Agnew (groin) both suffered injuries during the opener. London‚Äôs injury came during Atlanta‚Äôs final drive, while Agnew didn‚Äôt see any offensive snaps before exiting, so the in-game injuries didn‚Äôt boost McCloud‚Äôs role. Mooney‚Äôs absence may have funnelled a few more targets to McCloud, who finished fourth on the team in receiving yards behind Bijan Robinson (100), Kyle Pitts (59) and London (55). McCloud posted career highs in receptions (62), targets (87) and receiving yards (686) last season with Kirk Cousins at the helm until the final three games, and if Week 1 was any indication, the veteran wideout will also be a key part of the offense under Michael Penix, who threw 42 times against Tampa Bay and targeted McCloud on 12 occasions over the second-year signal-caller‚Äôs trio of starts to finish the 2024 campaign. McCloud will be the primary slot receiver when everyone is healthy, but he may have expanded responsibilities if London and Mooney miss extended time.</p> <h4 id="rashod-bateman-wr">Rashod Bateman (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> It was a disappointing outing for Bateman in such a high-scoring affair, but he did manage to finish second in targets among Baltimore receiving options. The 2021 first-round selection posted a career best 45-756-9 receiving line for the Ravens in 2024, so there is hope that the No. 2 wideout can produce better numbers than what we saw in Sunday‚Äôs loss. Bateman‚Äôs next opportunity to cash in that potential comes in a home matchup against the Browns next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="zay-flowers-wr">Zay Flowers (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Flowers overcame an undisclosed injury during the practice week in order to suit up for Baltimore‚Äôs season opener. Fantasy managers were elated to not only see the speedy receiver in the starting lineup, but also back producing true WR1 numbers after suffering a knee sprain in Week 18 last year. The 143 receiving yards set a new high-water mark for the third-year wideout, while his nine targets finished five ahead of the second-highest player (Rashod Bateman). Flowers is shaping up to be an elite fantasy option heading into next Sunday‚Äôs tilt against the Browns.</p> <h4 id="derrick-henry-rb">Derrick Henry (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Henry suffered the lowlight of Sunday‚Äôs contest when the normally sure-handed back coughed up a fumble on Baltimore‚Äôs second-to-last drive, allowing Buffalo to score a TD with just under two minutes remaining to close the gap to 40-38. Fantasy managers won‚Äôt lost any sleep over the rare fumble, as it came on the heels of a monstrous statistical performance from the 31-year-old. The perennial All-Pro lost just one fumble over his last two full seasons, so Sunday‚Äôs faux pas should be considered an anomaly. Henry is showing no signs of slowing down heading into a Week 2 matchup against the Browns.</p> <h4 id="josh-allen-qb">Josh Allen (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Allen opened the scoring with a 15-yard touchdown pass to Dalton Kincaid on the opening drive, but the Ravens responded with a 20-3 run. Allen and the offense kept Buffalo within striking distance in the second half, and the dual-threat quarterback scored a two-yard rushing touchdown early in the fourth quarter, two plays after connecting with James Cook for a 51-yard gain through the air. That rushing score was the 66th of Allen‚Äôs regular-season career, surpassing Thurman Thomas for the most in Bills history. Allen then tossed a 10-yard touchdown pass to Keon Coleman and added a one-yard rushing touchdown before guiding the offense in position for a game-winning field goal in the final seconds of a fourth quarter that featured 251 Allen passing yards, as the Bills played their best football down the stretch while the Ravens sputtered. With the other three AFC East teams all losing Sunday, the Bills already hold the division lead heading into a Week 2 road game against the Jets.</p> <h4 id="cedric-tillman-wr">Cedric Tillman (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Tillman snagged a five-yard pass on a crossing route in the back of the end zone for Cleveland‚Äôs lone touchdown. He also had one of three fourth-quarter drops by Browns receivers. His drop with 1:24 remaining was the dagger, as it bounded off his hands and into the arms of the Bengals‚Äô DJ Turner. Despite the drop, a lot went right in Week 1 for Tillman, who saw good target volume and had a 25-yard reception. After flashing in the middle of the 2024 season, a concussion ended his year after Week 12 and left his status for 2025 up in the air. Tillman enters the season as the No. 2 wideout opposite Jerry Jeudy, and nothing that transpired Sunday will change that.</p> <h4 id="sam-laporta-te">Sam LaPorta (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> LaPorta was the bright spot in an otherwise underwhelming offensive performance from Detroit, as he led the team in yards and finished second in targets. He also accounted for the team‚Äôs longest play from scrimmage on a 32-yard catch and run to begin the second half. LaPorta isn‚Äôt likely to consistently see nine targets as he shares looks with Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jameson Williams, but he will be a key part of Detroit‚Äôs offense ‚Äì particularly in the red zone.</p> <h4 id="amon-ra-st-brown-wr">Amon-Ra St. Brown (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Lions‚Äô offense struggled to get going for most of the game, with both St. Brown and Jameson Williams putting up muted stats as a result. St. Brown managed only one catch that went for more than nine yards, though he still finished second on the team in receiving yards. Detroit will return home for a Week 2 matchup against the Bears, and the offense should be in line for better results.</p> <h4 id="najee-harris-rb">Najee Harris (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Head coach Jim Harbaugh said in advance of Friday‚Äôs opener that Harris would play but that Omarion Hampton would draw the start, and the rookie ultimately handled a workhorse role. Hampton totaled 17 touches against the Chiefs‚Äô firm defensive front, rushing 15 times for 48 yards and securing both of his targets for 13 yards. Harris‚Äô backfield role could grow as he puts further distance between himself and the minor eye injury that forced him to sit out all of training camp and the preseason, but Hampton looks solidified as the starter in Los Angeles‚Äô backfield and projects to dominate touches again in Week 2 on the road against Las Vegas.</p> <h4 id="keenan-allen-wr">Keenan Allen (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Signed exactly one month ago, Allen hopped into the Chargers‚Äô starting lineup and balled like he never departed for Chicago last season. The 33-year-old wound up leading Los Angeles in targets (10) and receptions (seven) while securing his 60th touchdown as a member of the Chargers. Allen‚Äôs fantasy value in drafts matched his free-agent appeal up until Friday‚Äôs renaissance, but the veteran is definitely worth consideration against the Raiders next Monday.</p> <h4 id="cam-ward-qb">Cam Ward (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Ward drew a tough assignment in his pro debut in a difficult road environment against a defense that is projected to be one of the best in the league. His stat line reflects that, as he managed only 4.0 yards per attempt while also taking six sacks. Ward was slightly off target on a few passes to Calvin Ridley that could have changed the trajectory of his performance, but the duo should gain increased chemistry as the season progresses.</p> <h4 id="jacory-croskey-merritt-rb">Jacory Croskey-Merritt (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Croskey-Merritt got as many rushing attempts as Austin Ekeler and Jeremy McNichols combined. The highlights of the rookie seventh-round pick‚Äôs NFL debut were a six-yard touchdown run in the second quarter and a 42-yard run in the fourth. Croskey-Merritt looks like the team‚Äôs go-to option on early downs heading into Thursday‚Äôs Week 2 game at Green Bay, but his lack of pass-catching ability should allow Ekeler to stay involved in passing situations.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_1_2025_HMB_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_1_2025_HMB_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week1"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Mama Daughter Duo Week 1 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-1-JST/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mama Daughter Duo Week 1 Report"/><published>2025-09-09T14:59:56+00:00</published><updated>2025-09-09T14:59:56+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-1-JST</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-1-JST/"><![CDATA[<pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="michael-penix-jr-qb">Michael Penix Jr. (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Penix opened his first full season as a starter in fine fashion, looking poised and in command against a veteran, aggressive Buccaneers defense for most of the afternoon. The southpaw signal-caller leveraged Bijan Robinson‚Äôs elite yards-after-catch skills on the opening drive, hitting his star running back for a 50-yard catch-and-run touchdown. Penix would go on to cap off an 18-play, 91-yard marathon drive in the fourth quarter with a four-yard touchdown run, and he then drove the Falcons a total of 60 yards in eight plays to put them in position for a would-be game-tying field goal that Younghoe Koo couldn‚Äôt convert. Penix also lost Drake London to a shoulder injury for that final drive, and it remains to be seen if he‚Äôll have his top target available for a Week 2 road showdown with the Vikings next Sunday night.</p> <h4 id="rome-odunze-wr">Rome Odunze (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Odunze kept hope alive for the Bears with a one-yard touchdown catch just before the two-minute warning in the fourth quarter. His nine targets paced the team, though DJ Moore (68) and Olamide Zaccheaus (42) both had more receiving yards Monday. Odunze, a 2024 first-round pick, is set up for a more consistent role in his second NFL season after he had three-plus catches in only nine of 17 games as a rookie. Up next for the Bears is a Week 2 trip to Detroit.</p> <h4 id="dandre-swift-rb">D‚ÄôAndre Swift (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Swift finished five yards shy of Caleb Williams‚Äô team-high rushing total and was the only Bears running back to record a carry, though rookie Kyle Monangai had one catch out of the backfield. While Swift seems locked into a high touch floor again due to a lack of competition, efficiency remains a concern, as he averaged a career-low 3.8 yards per carry last season and dipped to just 3.1 in Monday‚Äôs small sample. Finding running room won‚Äôt be easy Week 2 against the Lions, who held Swift to 59 yards on 20 carries (3.0 YPC) in two 2024 meetings.</p> <h4 id="caleb-williams-qb">Caleb Williams (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Williams got the Ben Johnson era off to an efficient start, hitting his first 10 throws under Chicago‚Äôs new head coach and play caller. That strong stretch also included a nine-yard Williams rushing touchdown to cap the opening drive. His first miss was a costly one, though, as it came on fourth down well into Vikings territory. Chicago took a 17-6 lead into the fourth quarter, but the Vikings responded with 21 unanswered points before Williams finally stemmed the bleeding with a one-yard touchdown pass to Rome Odunze with 2:02 remaining. The Bears got the ball back in the final seconds but couldn‚Äôt muster a final push. Williams‚Äô rushing production was encouraging, but he struggled with accuracy after his hot start through the air. He‚Äôll try to put together a more complete performance against the Lions in Week 2.</p> <h4 id="jayden-reed-wr">Jayden Reed (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Reed likely will be operating under a maintenance program for as long as the Jones fracture in his left foot is bothering him, but he was able to suit up for Sunday‚Äôs win against the Lions, logging 18 of 48 offensive snaps (38 percent) in the process. He was effective with his limited workload, hauling in three of five targets for 45 yards and one touchdown and taking two punt returns for 21 yards. Reed will have two more chances to be deemed a practice participant this week ahead of Thursday‚Äôs matchup with the Commanders.</p> <h4 id="travis-kelce-te">Travis Kelce (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> It was shaping up as an utterly forgettable night for Kelce until his early fourth-quarter 37-yard touchdown grab, as he had just one catch for 10 yards until that point and had collided with teammate Xavier Worthy on the third play from scrimmage, causing a shoulder injury that forced the latter‚Äôs exit from the game. Kelce‚Äôs score therefore served as the only highlight of his night, and with Worthy out, both Hollywood Brown and JuJu Smith-Schuster outpaced the talented tight end in targets. Kelce could well see an increase in opportunity during a Week 2 home Super Bowl LIX rematch against the Eagles on Sunday, Sept. 14, especially if Worthy remains sidelined for that marquee contest.</p> <h4 id="hunter-henry-te">Hunter Henry (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Henry ‚Äì whose eight targets tied for the team lead ‚Äì was on the field for 66 of a possible 71 snaps on offense in the contest, per Mike Reiss of ESPN.com, while fellow tight end Austin Hooper logged 23 snaps and one catch for 10 yards. In the weeks ahead, Henry should continue to maintain enough of a workload and target volume to merit fantasy lineup consideration. Next up for the Patriots is a road game against a Miami team that lost to Indianapolis in Week 1 by a score of 33-8.</p> <h4 id="chris-olave-wr">Chris Olave (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The oft-injured wideout went to the sideline early in the game with what was reported to be a chest injury, but Olave quickly returned and wound up leading the Saints in targets. Meanwhile, tight end Juwan Johnson surpassed him in catches and yards. New Orleans‚Äô passing game under new coach Kellen Moore could be a boon to all the team‚Äôs top pass catchers, as Spencer Rattler attempted a career-high 46 passes despite the fact that the score remained fairly close the whole way. Olave will look to stay on the field and continue building chemistry with Rattler in a Week 2 home clash against the 49ers.</p> <h4 id="devonta-smith-wr">DeVonta Smith (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> As Smith‚Äôs line corroborates, it was a quiet night for the speedster to open the 2025 campaign. Smith finished behind both Saquon Barkley and Dallas Goedert in receptions on the night, while No. 3 receiver Jahan Dotson outgained him by 43 yards on the same number of catches. Nevertheless, there‚Äôs no question more productive days are ahead for Smith, and a Week 2 road rematch with a Chiefs team he recorded 69 yards and a touchdown against in Super Bowl LIX in February may provide just the platform for Smith‚Äôs first noteworthy performance of the new season.</p> <h4 id="kaleb-johnson-rb">Kaleb Johnson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Johnson clearly served as Pittsburgh‚Äôs third running back, with his only rushing attempt coming late in the third quarter. His primary contribution came as a kick returner, though he narrowly escaped disaster when a teammate recovered his fumble on a return late in the first quarter. Johnson had an uneven training camp due to his work as a pass blocker and receiver, so he‚Äôll likely continue to be brought along slowly behind Jaylen Warren and Kenneth Gainwell.</p> <h4 id="dk-metcalf-wr">DK Metcalf (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Metcalf led the Steelers in targets and yards in his debut with the team, with the majority of his production coming after the catch. He logged long gains of 31 and 23 yards on quick screens in the first quarter before working over the middle for an 18-yard gain late in the third quarter. Jonnu Smith and Calvin Austin were also heavily targeted in the offense, so Metcalf may have inconsistent results. However, he had a strong Week 1 performance with his new team.</p> <h4 id="christian-mccaffrey-rb">Christian McCaffrey (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> McCaffrey shook off any concerns from popping up on the injury report late in the practice week by handling 31 combined touches in a tight victory over a division foe to kick off the regular season. Newly-acquired backup Brian Robinson (9-33-0) was the only other back to receive a carry outside of McCaffrey. The 49ers didn‚Äôt have the luxury of taking a cautious approach with its star running back after TE George Kittle (hamstring) and WR Jauan Jennings (shoulder) both left Sunday‚Äôs contest due to injury. McCaffrey could continue to see extra work as a receiver if either of his banged-up teammates are forced to miss next Sunday‚Äôs road matchup against the Saints.</p> <h4 id="rachaad-white-rb">Rachaad White (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> White unsurprisingly played a clear second fiddle to Bucky Irving, logging 12 fewer carries than his teammate. White also was three targets behind Irving and trailed the latter in snaps by a 44-14 margin. While the division of labor between the two wasn‚Äôt typically as unbalanced down the stretch last season during Irving‚Äôs ascension within the offense, White‚Äôs fantasy outlook is bleak for the time being heading into a tough Week 2 road matchup against the Texans next Monday night.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_1_2025_JST_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_1_2025_JST_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week1"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Fantasy Guru Kayden Week 1 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-1-KTT/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Fantasy Guru Kayden Week 1 Report"/><published>2025-09-09T14:59:56+00:00</published><updated>2025-09-09T14:59:56+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-1-KTT</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-1-KTT/"><![CDATA[<pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="david-njoku-te">David Njoku (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Njoku was projected to be Joe Flacco‚Äôs second target behind Jerry Jeudy, but he was overshadowed by several Browns‚Äô pass catchers. The most notable was rookie tight end Harold Fannin, who drew rave reviews during the preseason and carried that into the regular season with nine targets. It‚Äôs likely that Njoku retakes a larger role in the offense moving forward, but Flacco‚Äôs distribution of targets in Week 1 was concerning.</p> <h4 id="evan-engram-te">Evan Engram (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Engram injured his calf in the fourth quarter of his Broncos debut. Prior to getting hurt, the veteran tight end had three catches for 21 yards on four targets. Adam Trautman and Lucas Krull are the two remaining healthy options dressed at the position, with Nate Adkins (ankle) inactive.</p> <h4 id="brian-thomas-jr-wr">Brian Thomas Jr. (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> It was a frustrating start to his second NFL season for Thomas, but he salvaged his day with a TD on an end-around in the second quarter. Better days will be ahead for the LSU product as the Jaguars adjust to new coach Liam Coen‚Äôs scheme, but the 1-11-0 line is already worse than Thomas had in any game as a rookie. He‚Äôll look for bigger volume and better production on the road Week 2 against the Bengals.</p> <h4 id="isiah-pacheco-rb">Isiah Pacheco (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Chiefs were down by a touchdown after one quarter and trailed throughout, which played a part in Pacheco seeing a modest workload. Additionally, backfield mate Kareem Hunt matched Pacheco‚Äôs carry total, while Patrick Mahomes paced the Chiefs with both his six rush attempts and 57 rushing yards. Despite Friday‚Äôs usage, Pacheco still profiles as Kansas City‚Äôs top running back heading into a Week 2 Super Bowl rematch with the Eagles at Arrowhead Stadium on Sunday, Sept. 14.</p> <h4 id="devon-achane-rb">De‚ÄôVon Achane (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Achane was certainly efficient on the ground, but his opportunities were capped by a surprising game script that saw the Colts already ahead by a 20-0 margin at halftime. The speedy back did offer underwhelmed fantasy managers some solace with his fourth-quarter 11-yard touchdown reception, and more opportunities on the ground should be available in a Week 2 home matchup against the Patriots.</p> <h4 id="kendre-miller-rb">Kendre Miller (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Miller operated as the No. 2 running back behind longtime starter Alvin Kamara, who paced the Saints‚Äô ground game with 11 carries for 45 yards and a touchdown. Meanwhile, third-string running back Devin Neal rounded out the ground game with two carries for nine yards. The overall lack of reliance on the rushing attack was a departure from the approach under last year‚Äôs offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak, as quarterback Spencer Rattler instead tossed a career-high 46 passing attempts. Both Miller and Neal also played under a dozen offensive snaps, with 11 and seven, respectively. The lack of playing time and the minimization of the rushing game don‚Äôt bode well for any running back playing behind Kamara this season. It will be worth monitoring if offensive-minded head coach Kellen Moore employs a similar approach during the Week 2 matchup versus San Francisco.</p> <h4 id="darius-slayton-wr">Darius Slayton (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Slayton was targeted by Russell Wilson just once on a day when the Giants‚Äô new quarterback heaved 37 total passes. Malik Nabers got a hefty amount of opportunities, as expected, with 12 targets, while Wan‚ÄôDale Robinson was pretty active with eight. Wilson completed just 17 of his 37 attempts for 168 yards, and if he continues to struggle the team may eventually turn to rookie Jaxson Dart, but head coach Brian Daboll confirmed Monday that Wilson will be the Week 2 starter Sunday in Dallas, per Adam Schefter of ESPN. With that in mind, Slayton doesn‚Äôt project to be an appealing fantasy target for that contest.</p> <h4 id="wandale-robinson-wr">Wan‚ÄôDale Robinson (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Robinson averaged 41.1 yards on 8.2 targets per game in 2024, so his Week 1 stat line wasn‚Äôt far from his customary production. Whether the Giants stick with veteran Russell Wilson in Week 2 against the Cowboys or turn to rookie first-round pick Jaxson Dart under center after Sunday‚Äôs ugly performance on offense, Robinson will continue to offer a high floor due to his significant involvement on short passes but have a limited ceiling due to his lack of downfield contributions.</p> <h4 id="aaron-rodgers-qb">Aaron Rodgers (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Steelers offense wasn‚Äôt as efficient as the point total suggests ‚Äì the unit averaged only 5.4 yards per play‚Äì but Rodgers averaged 8.1 yards per attempt and made up for an ineffective ground game. He often got the ball out of his hands quickly, with DK Metcalf and Calvin Austin excelling after the catch. Rodgers also did plenty on his own to take down his former team, delivering touchdowns from 22, 18, five and three yards away to four different receivers. It was an excellent debut with Pittsburgh for Rodgers, and he‚Äôll now lead the team into a Week 2 matchup against Seattle.</p> <h4 id="baker-mayfield-qb">Baker Mayfield (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Mayfield was considerably less efficient than usual while facing a feisty Falcons defense in a rowdy dome environment, but after some early struggles, the veteran signal-caller was able to awaken the Buccaneers offense with a 30-yard scoring strike to rookie Emeka Egbuka. Mayfield would subsequently connect with Bucky Irving from nine yards out in the third quarter, and he capped off what turned out to be a rewarding fantasy day with a critical 25-yard touchdown toss to Egbuka with just under one minute remaining to erase a 20-17 deficit. Mayfield also finished as Tampa Bay‚Äôs leading rusher, and his quick chemistry with Egbuka bodes well heading into a tough Week 2 road matchup against the Texans on Monday night, Sept. 15.</p> <h4 id="mike-evans-wr">Mike Evans (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Evans recorded team-high catch and target totals while finishing second in receiving yards to rookie position mate Emeka Egbuka. However, it was the latter and Bucky Irving who ended up on the receiving end of Baker Mayfield‚Äôs three touchdown passes, leaving Evans with a solid but relatively muted season-opening line. The perennial Pro Bowler could be due for an even bigger workload in a Week 2 road showdown against the Texans on Monday night, Sept. 15.</p> <h4 id="tyler-lockett-wr">Tyler Lockett (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Lockett was on the field for 33 offensive snaps (58 percent), less than rookie Elic Ayomanor. Lockett was also an afterthought in the offense, with his only target coming on the fourth play of the game. The Titans‚Äô passing offense should have more success in future weeks, but Lockett doesn‚Äôt look to be a priority target.</p> <h4 id="austin-ekeler-rb">Austin Ekeler (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Commanders held a walkthrough Monday on the heels of Sunday‚Äôs 21-6 win over the Giants. In that contest, Ekeler logged 33 of a possible 70 snaps on offense, while carrying six times for 26 yards and catching all three of his targets for 31 yards. Now that he‚Äôs managing a shoulder issue, however, Ekeler‚Äôs status should be tracked ahead of Thursday night‚Äôs game against the Packers. If he‚Äôs available, Ekeler would be in line to continue to share backfield work with Jacory Croskey-Merritt (10 carries for 82 yards and a touchdown Sunday) and Jeremy McNichols (four carries for 25 yards). Of the the trio, Ekeler was the only one to record a catch Week 1.</p> <h4 id="jayden-daniels-qb">Jayden Daniels (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Daniels gave the Commanders a 7-0 lead with a seven-yard touchdown pass to Zach Ertz in the first quarter, and Washington took a 14-3 lead into the locker room, but it could have been larger if not for an intentional grounding penalty on Daniels from the Giants‚Äô four-yard line that resulted in a half-ending 10-second runoff. Washington‚Äôs defense continued to stifle the Giants in the second half, so Daniels wasn‚Äôt asked to do too much, though he still topped the 60-yard rushing mark for the seventh time in 18 regular-season NFL starts. Daniels‚Äô ability to contribute with both his arm and legs makes the second-year pro an elite fantasy option heading into Thursday‚Äôs Week 2 trip to Green Bay.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_1_2025_KTT_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_1_2025_KTT_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week1"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Michael‚Äôs Managable Team Week 1 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-1-MMT/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Michael‚Äôs Managable Team Week 1 Report"/><published>2025-09-09T14:59:56+00:00</published><updated>2025-09-09T14:59:56+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-1-MMT</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-1-MMT/"><![CDATA[<pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="khalil-shakir-wr">Khalil Shakir (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Shakir showed no ill effects from the high-ankle sprain that sidelined him during training camp, as he finished second on the team in targets, catches and receiving yards behind Keon Coleman, who had 112 yards and a touchdown on 11 targets. Shakir led the Bills in all three categories last season, but the emergence of Coleman and addition of Joshua Palmer in the offseason gives Shakir more competition for attention from Josh Allen heading into a Week 2 road game against the Jets.</p> <h4 id="jake-ferguson-te">Jake Ferguson (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Ferguson finished second in receptions on the Cowboys to CeeDee Lamb and third in receiving yards, although the latter total was a reflection of a low-volume passing night for Dallas. Nevertheless, it was encouraging to see Ferguson as Dak Prescott‚Äôs second-favorite target on the night, as it was a reminder of the chemistry between the two that was nullified by Prescott‚Äôs season-ending hamstring avulsion in Week 9 of last season. Ferguson could remain similarly busy during the Cowboys‚Äô Week 2 home opener against the Giants on Sunday, Sept. 14.</p> <h4 id="george-pickens-wr">George Pickens (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The big-name offseason addition didn‚Äôt see Dak Prescott look his way anywhere near as much as CeeDee Lamb, but Pickens made some solid contributions in the narrow loss. The talented receiver made his first regular-season catch as a Cowboy on a six-yard grab during Dallas‚Äô opening drive, and he‚Äôd go on to draw a 34-yard pass interference penalty on Quinyon Mitchell before the quarter was over. Pickens also had a key 15-yard grab on third down with just under three minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, but he was guilty of an unnecessary roughness penalty deep in Eagles territory in the third quarter on a drive that culminated in a Miles Sanders fumble. Pickens is naturally expected to settle into the Cowboys‚Äô air attack the more he plays, and a Week 2 home matchup against the Giants on Sunday, Sept. 14 could represent an opportunity for his first breakout performance.</p> <h4 id="rj-harvey-rb">RJ Harvey (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Harvey alternated drives with J.K. Dobbins for most of the first half, though the Broncos relied heavily on Dobbins down the stretch to secure a victory in positive game script. The end result was that Harvey was out-touched 18-7 by Dobbins, but Harvey still managed to show off his explosiveness on a 50-yard run early in the fourth quarter, which ultimately set up a Dobbins score. While Harvey looks to be the second back in Denver for the time being, he still has a clear role in the offense and could see that expand if he continues to prove himself as a pro.</p> <h4 id="jahmyr-gibbs-rb">Jahmyr Gibbs (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> There was plenty of offseason speculation that Gibbs would take over the backfield from David Montgomery, though Montgomery had 11 carries to Gibbs‚Äô nine. Gibbs still managed to salvage his day with a team-leading 10 catches, but he also found running room hard to come by in that context. Week 1 was a disastrous game for the Detroit offense overall, so a Week 2 matchup with the Bears should allow Gibbs to bounce back while also potentially clarifying his role in a more typical game script.</p> <h4 id="woody-marks-rb">Woody Marks (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Marks, a 2025 fourth-round draft pick, entered the regular season as the fourth back on the depth chart, and nothing about Sunday‚Äôs usage changed that. He‚Äôs solidly behind Nick Chubb, Dameon Pierce and Dare Ogunbowale and will have to be patient and wait for his opportunities.</p> <h4 id="bhayshul-tuten-rb">Bhayshul Tuten (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The rookie fourth-round pick finished fourth among Jacksonville‚Äôs tailbacks with just four offensive snaps, though he still garnered three carries in the blowout. Both Tuten and rookie seventh rounder LeQuint Allen had minimal roles in the season opener, but the No. 2 job is wide open after the Jaguars traded Tank Bigsby to the Eagles on Monday. Travis Etienne is locked in as the starter after posting 156 yards from scrimmage Week 1, but Tuten and Allen are now positioned to compete for the backup job.</p> <h4 id="tre-harris-wr">Tre‚Äô Harris (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Harris, a 2025 second-round pick, played just five offensive snaps, while sixth-rounder KeAndre Lambert-Smith played 14. Quarterback Justin Herbert targeted each rookie just once, however, and Lambert-Smith finished Week 1 without a catch. Ladd McConkey, Keenan Allen and Quentin Johnston dominated opportunities in the passing game, combining for 26 targets, and the three appear solidified as a starting trio atop the Chargers‚Äô wide receiver depth chart. Harris thus looks destined to reprise a depth role in Week 2 against the Raiders on Monday night, and any path for him to see significantly increased opportunities in the near future could depend on one of McConkey, Allen or Johnston missing time.</p> <h4 id="davante-adams-wr">Davante Adams (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Adams finished second in targets, receptions and receiving yards in a successful debut for the Rams after inking a two-year, $46 million deal this past offseason. The 32-year-old‚Äôs poor catch rate (50 percent) could be attributed to lack of preseason reps with Matthew Stafford while the QB dealt with an ailing back. Adams‚Äô pursuit of a sixth straight 1,000-yard receiving season continues in a road tilt against the Titans next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="tj-hockenson-te">T.J. Hockenson (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Vikings‚Äô passing attack was mostly quiet the majority of the night as J.J. McCarthy made his NFL regular-season debut, helping lead to a modest showing for the veteran tight end. Hockenson entered the season with elevated expectations considering he‚Äôs now nearly two years removed from suffering multiple knee ligament tears Week 16 of the 2023 season, but his production will naturally be largely dependent on how quickly McCarthy gets his feet under him. Hockenson will next take aim at the Falcons defense in a Week 2 home matchup on Sunday night.</p> <h4 id="drake-maye-qb">Drake Maye (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Beginning what is to be his first full season as a starter, Maye fought an uphill battle for most of the afternoon in a game where the Patriots found themselves down 7-0 after the opening possession. He would ultimately help keep New England competitive with a two-yard touchdown toss to DeMario Douglas to knot the score at 7-7 later in the first quarter, and he would also lead a late 10-play drive that would culminate in a field goal and put New England within seven points. Maye did an excellent job spreading the ball around by recording completions to nine different pass catchers, and he‚Äôll head into a Week 2 divisional road battle against what was a generous Dolphins secondary in Week 1 with plenty of momentum.</p> <h4 id="alvin-kamara-rb">Alvin Kamara (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The veteran RB showed he had plenty of juice left in the tank on the Saints‚Äô only TD of the game, an 18-yard scamper early in the second quarter, but Kamara otherwise didn‚Äôt find much running room. Kellen Moore‚Äôs new offense leaned heavily on the passing game as Spencer Rattler attempted a career-high 46 passes, but that may not be a detriment to Kamara‚Äôs production given his proven ability as a receiver. He‚Äôll look to make an impact again at home Week 2 against the 49ers.</p> <h4 id="ricky-pearsall-wr">Ricky Pearsall (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Pearsall took on an expanded role after George Kittle (hamstring) and Jauan Jennings (shoulder) did not return from their respective injuries suffered in Sunday‚Äôs victory. The 24-year-old Pearsall was up to the task, ripping off multiple big-chunk plays en route to his first 100-yard game of 2025. The University of Florida product was already expected to have a breakout season entering his second year, but he could be asked to do even more if either Kittle or Jennings is forced to miss time. Pearsall will attempt to build off of this promising start when the 49ers take on the Saints next Sunday.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_1_2025_MMT_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_1_2025_MMT_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week1"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Americas Team Week 1 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-1-RRT/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Americas Team Week 1 Report"/><published>2025-09-09T14:59:56+00:00</published><updated>2025-09-09T14:59:56+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-1-RRT</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-1-RRT/"><![CDATA[<pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="trey-mcbride-te">Trey McBride (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> He led the Cardinals in receptions, but it was Marvin Harrison who produced a team-high 71 receiving yards. McBride is coming off a massive 2024 campaign in which he posted a 111-1,146-2 line on 147 targets, and while a breakout season from Harrison could cut into the tight end‚Äôs volume, Arizona‚Äôs target tree figures to be narrow. McBride will look to stay productive at home in Week 2 against the Panthers.</p> <h4 id="hunter-renfrow-wr">Hunter Renfrow (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The veteran wideout logged 42 offensive snaps during Sunday‚Äôs loss, ranking third amongst Carolina receivers behind Tetairoa McMillan (53) and Xavier Legette (50). Although Bryce Young was forced to throw 35 times due to Carolina‚Äôs 20-point fourth-quarter deficit, Renfrow still finished third on the team in targets, which could be a promising sign for his role in this offense. Renfrow is expected to continue serving as the Panthers‚Äô No. 3 wide receiver as the team travels to Arizona in Week 2.</p> <h4 id="chuba-hubbard-rb">Chuba Hubbard (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The 26-year-old RB scored the Panthers‚Äô only TD late in the fourth quarter, catching the ball in the flat and sprinting down the sideline for a 27-yard score. Hubbard is coming off a career-best 2024 campaign in which he amassed 1,366 yards from scrimmage and 11 total touchdowns, and the offseason addition of Rico Dowdle to the backfield doesn‚Äôt appear to have impacted his role or touch volume. Hubbard will look to stay productive on the road Week 2 against the Cardinals.</p> <h4 id="jamarr-chase-wr">Ja‚ÄôMarr Chase (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Bengals managed a surprisingly low 141 net yards, limiting the production of all their skill-position players. Chase tied for the team lead with five targets ‚Äì Joe Burrow attempted only 23 passes ‚Äì and also was responsible for the team‚Äôs longest play from scrimmage on a 20-yard catch midway through the second quarter. While it was a disappointing start to the season, Chase and the entire Cincinnati offense should produce better in Week 2 against Jacksonville.</p> <h4 id="david-montgomery-rb">David Montgomery (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Lions‚Äô offense struggled to get on track, which led to underwhelming performances for nearly all of their skill-position players. Montgomery wasn‚Äôt an exception, but he did manage 15 touches, nearly evenly matching Jahmyr Gibbs‚Äô 19. A more typical game script may change how the backs are deployed, but Montgomery still appears to have a significant role in Detroit‚Äôs backfield heading into a Week 2 matchup against the Bears.</p> <h4 id="dalton-schultz-te">Dalton Schultz (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Schultz led the Texans in targets on a low-volume passing day, but the end result was still lackluster from a fantasy perspective. The good news for the veteran tight end is that he remained the No. 1 tight end option for QB C.J. Stroud despite posting mediocre numbers in 2024. Schultz should be considered a low-ceiling fantasy option heading into next Monday‚Äôs tilt against Tampa Bay.</p> <h4 id="travis-etienne-jr-rb">Travis Etienne Jr. (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The fourth-year RB headed into Week 1 with big questions about his spot on the Jaguars‚Äô depth chart, and how much of the workload he might have to share with Tank Bigsby and rookie Bhayshul Tuten. Etienne answered those questions in emphatic fashion, with his longest gain going for 71 yards in the second quarter to set up a Brian Thomas touchdown. Meanwhile, Bigsby and Tuten combined for just 23 rushing yards on eight carries, and neither one caught a pass. New coach Liam Coen turned Bucky Irving into a star last season in Tampa Bay, and at least through one week, he appears to be working that same magic with Etienne. He‚Äôll look to keep rolling in a Week 2 road battle against the Bengals.</p> <h4 id="matthew-stafford-qb">Matthew Stafford (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Stafford missed the entire preseason dealing with a minor back injury, getting cleared just in time to start the regular-season opener. The veteran signal-caller showed no ill effects under center, producing a 109.1 passer rating with no turnovers in a tight victory. With Davante Adams (4-51-0) replacing Cooper Kupp across from star wideout Puka Nacua (10-130-0) this season, Stafford has one of the best WR duos at his disposal heading into next Sunday‚Äôs road game against the Titans.</p> <h4 id="rhamondre-stevenson-rb">Rhamondre Stevenson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Stevenson entered Week 1 as the presumptive lead back, although rookie second-round pick TreVeyon Henderson is already ticketed for a solid complementary role at minimum. However, Week 1 usage between the two players actually tilted toward Henderson due to his expansive pass-catching role (six receptions), although game script did play a part in that as well. Henderson is the more explosive of the two, but Stevenson could fill the role of the preferred early-down option in a Week 2 road matchup against the Dolphins if the game remains close.</p> <h4 id="spencer-rattler-qb">Spencer Rattler (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The second-year QB didn‚Äôt commit a turnover, but that was about the only silver lining to his Week 1 performance. Rattler attempted a career-high 46 passes in his first game in new coach Kellen Moore‚Äôs scheme despite the fact that the score was fairly close all the way through, but his 4.7 yards per attempt was poor. With Tyler Shough waiting in the wings, Rattler may need to improve his numbers quickly to keep his starting job, beginning with a Week 2 home tilt against the 49ers.</p> <h4 id="aj-brown-wr">A.J. Brown (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Brown‚Äôs near shutout was alarming considering his typical importance to the Eagles‚Äô air attack, but both passing games were relatively subdued in the opener. While Brown garnered plenty of defensive attention, Dallas Goedert and Jahan Dotson appeared to be the biggest beneficiaries, and Brown finally got on the board with a timely eight-yard grab with 1:51 remaining to set up a game-sealing Jalen Hurts four-yard scramble. Needless to say, stat lines like Thursday‚Äôs should be few and far between for Brown this season, and he‚Äôs a virtual lock to be exponentially more involved a Week 2 road Super Bowl rematch with the Chiefs on Sunday, Sept. 14.</p> <h4 id="brian-robinson-jr-rb">Brian Robinson Jr. (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Robinson had a smooth debut with San Francisco after being dealt from Washington just weeks before the start of the regular season. The 2022 third-round pick slotted directly behind starter Christian McCaffrey and handled 10 touches while playing 18 snaps on offense (24 percent). Robinson and his downhill running style should continue spelling CMC while receiving a handful of touches against the Saints next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="cooper-kupp-wr">Cooper Kupp (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Kupp struggled to establish himself in Seattle‚Äôs new-look offense, finishing a distant second behind Jaxon Smith-Njigba (9-124-0) in overall production. The 32-year-old Kupp may not be his former MVP self, but the fact he still finished second in targets bodes well for his prospects in games with higher passing volume than the 23 attempts Seattle amassed Sunday. For now, Kupp‚Äôs fantasy value may be limited to deeper formats for next week‚Äôs contest against the Steelers.</p> <h4 id="sam-darnold-qb">Sam Darnold (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Darnold failed to impress in his first game with the Seahawks after signing a lucrative deal this past offseason. The change of scenery couldn‚Äôt erase the veteran signal-caller‚Äôs propensity to come up short in the clutch. Darnold had Seattle deep in San Francisco‚Äôs territory on the team‚Äôs final drive when he lost grip of the ball on a windup that the 49ers recovered to effectively end the game. A bounce-back performance will have to come on the road against a T.J. Watt-led Steelers‚Äô defense next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="jaxon-smith-njigba-wr">Jaxon Smith-Njigba (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Smith-Njigba had his coming out party as the unquestioned No. 1 option in Seattle following the departure of DK Metcalf to Pittsburgh this past offseason. The 23-year-old Smith-Njigba received 10 more looks than the next receiver (Cooper Kupp), immediately becoming new starting quarterback Sam Darnold‚Äôs favorite target. JSN did suffer from a case of fumblitis when he put two balls on the ground (losing possession of one), something the wideout will surely work to clean up in practice. Smith-Njigba will look to build off a promising start to the campaign when the Seahawks take on the Steelers next Sunday.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_1_2025_RRT_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_1_2025_RRT_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week1"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry></feed>
