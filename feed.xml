</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="cooper-rush-qb">Cooper Rush (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Rush drew his second straight start in the absence of Lamar Jackson (hamstring). He ran a decent first possession that resulted in a field goal, completing both of his passes for 12 yards while also scrambling for seven. However, he was intercepted on Baltimore’s following drive and the team had several additional miscues before Rush was finally pulled after losing a fumble deep in Rams territory late in the third quarter. Jackson is expected back in Week 8 following Baltimore’s bye, and Rush could be in danger of being demoted to the third-string quarterback.</p> <h4 id="dj-moore-wr">DJ Moore (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The injury didn’t cost Moore any extensive playing time Monday, with the wideout finishing the contest with three catches for 42 yards on five targets to go with two carries for 10 yards. The 28-year-old was nonetheless admitted to a local hospital after the game due to the injury, though he was held overnight merely for precautionary purposes. Johnson said that the Bears will continue to monitor Moore’s status, but for now, the receiver still looks to have a chance at playing in Week 7 against the Saints.</p> <h4 id="roschon-johnson-rb">Roschon Johnson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Though Johnson has now suited up four games this season, Monday marked the first time that he’s touched the ball in 2025. His role is expected to be contained mostly to special teams while rookie Kyle Monangai serves as the Bears’ No. 2 running back behind D’Andre Swift.</p> <h4 id="tee-higgins-wr">Tee Higgins (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> This was far from a standout performance from Higgins, but it did represent his highest reception and yardage totals of the season. He narrowly missed out on a more impressive fantasy showing, as he was dragged down at Green Bay’s one-yard line on a 13-yard reception midway through the third quarter. Higgins was evaluated for a concussion due to the tackle on that same play but was cleared to return without missing a full possession. The Cincinnati offense is still likely to be inconsistent, but Joe Flacco prioritized getting the ball to Higgins and Ja’Marr Chase in his Bengals debut, which has improved the outlook for the star pass catchers.</p> <h4 id="joe-flacco-qb">Joe Flacco (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Flacco had a quick turnaround after being traded to Cincinnati on Tuesday. Given that and a tough road matchup, he performed relatively well. He led three scoring drives in the second half, highlighted by a two-yard touchdown pass to Tanner Hudson and a 19-yard scoring toss to Ja’Marr Chase. This marked Flacco’s first multi-touchdown performance across five starts in 2025, and he should be able to put up respectable numbers with the help of Chase and Tee Higgins.</p> <h4 id="jerome-ford-rb">Jerome Ford (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Ford was on the field for 33 offensive snaps – the most since Week 2 – and had seven touches for the second straight week. His playing time has increased the last two games, which is tied to the quarterback change from Joe Flacco to rookie Dillon Gabriel. Ford leads the running back room with 21 targets through six games and could see an uptick in usage as a runner going forward, as the organization seeks to protect the one hopeful thing it has on offense, rookie running back Quinshon Judkins.</p> <h4 id="christian-kirk-wr">Christian Kirk (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Kirk had his best day as a Texan due primarily to a 47-yard catch to start the fourth quarter, narrowly missing a touchdown while being taken down at the three-yard line. Houston has spread its targets relatively evenly between several different pass catchers early this season, leaving Kirk with only four targets in consecutive games. That limited volume will hurt his fantasy outlook, though Sunday’s big play was encouraging.</p> <h4 id="jj-mccarthy-qb">J.J. McCarthy (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> While head coach Kevin O’Connell has not named a starting quarterback for Sunday’s game against the Eagles, he previously said McCarthy would need a full week of practice in order to gain clearance to play. Meanwhile Carson Wentz was also able to practice Monday, despite nursing a sore non-throwing shoulder. If McCarthy is able to practice without major limitations all week, he could return to the starting job.</p> <h4 id="juwan-johnson-te">Juwan Johnson (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Johnson suited up after dealing with an ankle issue during practice for the second week in a row. The 29-year-old also logged exactly two catches for the second straight contest, as he recorded season lows in targets and receiving yards. The lowlight of Johnson’s performance came on his second catch when he coughed up a fumble in the fourth quarter. Johnson went from averaging 9.7 targets per game over the first three weeks to averaging 3.0 over the last three weeks. This downturn in opportunities has coincided with the overall decrease in passing attempts for the Saints across the last three games, so it appears his dropoff in production may continue so long as the New Orleans offense eases its reliance on Spencer Rattler’s arm. Johnson will look to grab more passes during the Week 7 contest versus Chicago on Sunday, Sept. 19.</p> <h4 id="breece-hall-rb">Breece Hall (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Hall’s workload was his largest of the season yet, as the Broncos and Jets engaged in a slugfest where pass protection was at a premium for Justin Fields, who was sacked nine times. Turning to Hall didn’t yield particularly encouraging dividends for New York, however, as Denver’s talented defense held the running back to a long run of eight yards. Hall had come in on an encouraging two-game stretch where he’d amassed 194 yards on 28 carries against the suspect defenses of the Dolphins and Cowboys, but the notable increase in the caliber of competition Sunday served to neutralize him. Hall and the Jets get an easier assignment in their return stateside, as the Panthers will pay a visit to MetLife Stadium next Sunday for a Week 7 interconference clash.</p> <h4 id="dallas-goedert-te">Dallas Goedert (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Goedert led the Eagles across the board in receptions, receiving yards and targets with those marks, and his game-best 36-yard catch also qualified as a season-high figure. The veteran tight end has scored all five of his touchdowns this season over the last four games, and that tally ties a career best for Goedert, who also recorded the same number of trips to the end zone in 2019. With 20 targets in his last two games alone, Goedert will remain a highly viable option in all formats during a Week 7 road matchup against the Vikings on Sunday, Oct. 19.</p> <h4 id="kendrick-bourne-wr">Kendrick Bourne (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Fresh off posting a career-best 142 receiving yards against the Rams in Week 5, Bourne likely made his managers double take at the box score after hitting that same mark in consecutive contests. The 29-year-old has shown great chemistry with old teammate Mac Jones, as the former Patriots continue to post video-game numbers filling in for injured 49ers starters in 2025. Bourne continued starting in place of Ricky Pearsall (knee) while Jauan Jennings (ribs) returned in a limited capacity but revealed that he was playing with five broken ribs after the contest. If Pearsall is forced to miss a third consecutive game in Week 7, then Bourne’s stock would remain elevated for next Sunday’s tilt against the Falcons.</p> <h4 id="zach-charbonnet-rb">Zach Charbonnet (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> As made clear by his rushing line, Charbonnet found virtually no running room against a talented Jaguars front seven, and he actually gained 10 fewer rushing yards on two more carries than backfield mate Kenneth Walker. Sunday marked Charbonnet’s fourth game with a sub-4.0-yards-per-carry figure this season, so outside of his occasional rushing touchdowns, the third-year back’s fantasy outlook remains stagnant heading into a tough Week 7 home matchup against the Texans on Monday night, Oct. 20.</p> <h4 id="kenneth-walker-iii-rb">Kenneth Walker III (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Walker logged two fewer carries than Zach Charbonnet, but he outgained his teammate by 10 rushing yards, as neither back was particularly efficient during the defense-centric battle. The fourth-year pro’s yardage total represented quite the downturn after he’d topped the 80-yard mark in each of the previous two games, and Charbonnet’s workload is somewhat of a concern for the moment for Walker’s fantasy managers. It remains to be seen if a similar timeshare will apply moving forward, but neither player has a particularly bright outlook for a Week 7 home matchup against a tough Texans defense on Monday night, Oct. 20.</p> <h4 id="terry-mclaurin-wr">Terry McLaurin (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_6_2025_BTE_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_6_2025_BTE_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <h2 id="projected-lineup-for-next-week">Projected Lineup for Next Week</h2> <p><strong>Total Projected Points:</strong> 80.10<br/></p> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_7_2025_BTE_projected.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> <th data-field="opponent" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="false">Opponent</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week6"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Week 6 League Recap</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-6_Recap/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Week 6 League Recap"/><published>2025-10-15T00:43:47+00:00</published><updated>2025-10-15T00:43:47+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-6_Recap</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-6_Recap/"><![CDATA[<h3 id="weekly-matchups">Weekly Matchups</h3> <h4 id="90s-moncon--emmas-excellent-team">90s MonCon @ Emma’s Excellent Team</h4> <p><strong>Final Score:</strong> 90s MonCon 67.71 - 89.62 Emma’s Excellent Team<br/> <strong>Best Performance:</strong> Drake London (Emma’s Excellent Team) - 26.80 pts<br/></p> <h4 id="rookie-mistake--michaels-managable-team">Rookie Mistake @ Michael’s Managable Team</h4> <p><strong>Final Score:</strong> Rookie Mistake 115.52 - 132.15 Michael’s Managable Team<br/> <strong>Best Performance:</strong> Drake Maye (Michael’s Managable Team) - 34.24 pts<br/></p> <h4 id="third-times-the-charm--mama-daughter-duo">Third Time’s the Charm?

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="drake-london-wr">Drake London (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> It was the Bijan Robinson and Drake London Show on Monday Night Football after the two budding superstars accounted for 396 of Atlanta’s 443 yards of offense. The 23-year-old London didn’t cool off over his team’s Week 5 bye, bookending the break with a pair of 100-plus yard games with a touchdown scored in each. He actually finished the contest as the only wide receiver to record a catch for Atlanta, highlighting his status as QB Michael Penix’s unquestioned No. 1 target. A red-hot London will set his sights on a battered 49ers defense Week 7.</p> <h4 id="justice-hill-rb">Justice Hill (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Ravens ran a run-heavy offense as long as possible, giving Hill a chance to mix in on possessions to relieve Derrick Henry. Hill saw a season-high six carries as a result, but he made a more significant impact as a pass catcher. His usage could change with the anticipated return of Lamar Jackson (hamstring) after the team’s bye, but Hill has at least three catches in four of six games on the campaign.</p> <h4 id="joshua-palmer-wr">Joshua Palmer (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable</p> <h4 id="courtland-sutton-wr">Courtland Sutton (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Sutton traveled overseas to London for Sunday’s international tilt, only to be greeted impolitely by Jets’ CB Sauce Gardner once the game kicked off. The shutdown corner won his individual matchup against Sutton, holding Denver’s No. 1 wideout to just one reception in the narrow victory. This was Sutton’s second one-catch performance through six starts this season, which would be concerning if he hadn’t posted WR1 numbers in his four other appearances. Sunday’s dud can be written off as a bad matchup coupled with an unfavorable game script. Look for Sutton to get back to his productive ways against the Giants next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="trevor-lawrence-qb">Trevor Lawrence (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Lawrence’s final passing line with more than adequate, but he also took seven sacks and finished with an ugly 46.6 QBR for the afternoon. The 2021 first overall pick did continue to cultivate his connection with No. 1 receiver Brian Thomas, who he hit on eight occasions for 90 yards, including a 21-yard touchdown late in the first quarter. Lawrence hit Tim Patrick from 26 yards out early in the fourth quarter for his other TD toss, the quarterback’s first multi-touchdown-pass tally since Week 2. Despite the solid numbers, the modest point total did Jacksonville in Sunday, a matter he’ll look to rectify in a London matchup against the high-powered Rams in Week 7.</p> <h4 id="hollywood-brown-wr">Hollywood Brown (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Brown delivered a standout performance under the bright lights of Sunday Night Football when he lifted his team with two trips to the end zone in the second half. The 28-year-old has done an admirable job starting for a thin Chiefs’ receiving corps, producing a 30-302-3 line through six weeks of action. The impending doom Brown’s managers are currently feeling is the looming return of Kansas City’s top WR Rashee Rice. The suspended wideout will return for next Sunday’s tilt against the Raiders, potentially eating into his replacement’s production in the process. Brown should remain rostered until the dust settles from Rice’s return, but expectations should be kept in check for Week 7.</p> <h4 id="jakobi-meyers-wr">Jakobi Meyers (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Meyers’ recent struggles continued, as he failed to eclipse 40 receiving yards for the third week running. At least the Raiders were able to pick up a win after losing their previous two contests during the wideout’s current slump. Las Vegas is still without the services of star TE Brock Bowers (knee), so Meyers needs to step up his play for both his team and frustrated fantasy managers. Perhaps Meyers can turn his disappointing campaign around if he can find the end zone for the first time in 2025 against the Chiefs next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="rashid-shaheed-wr">Rashid Shaheed (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The speedy wideout has caught exactly four passes in five straight games, but Sunday’s yardage total was his lowest of the season. Shaheed remains dependent on deep throws for significant fantasy value, but with Spencer Rattler getting more confident and comfortable in coach Kellen Moore’s offense, connections like last week’s 87-yard TD could become more frequent. Shaheed may have a better chance of making an impact in Week 7 against the Bears.</p> <h4 id="saquon-barkley-rb">Saquon Barkley (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Barkley was set up well on paper for a matchup against the Giants’ porous run defense, but game script would eventually cap his opportunities and lead to his second-lowest carry total of the campaign. He was efficient with his opportunities, averaging an encouraging 4.8 yards per carry after posting 5.0 yards per tote in the Week 5 loss to the Broncos. Barkley has still to crack the 90-yard mark on the ground through six games, however, and he’s still averaging just 3.4 yards per carry on the season thanks to a slow start to the season. Barkley will have a tough Week 7 challenge on his hands as well, considering the talented Vikings defense awaits in a Week 7 road matchup on Sunday, Oct. 19.</p> <h4 id="brock-purdy-qb">Brock Purdy (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable</p> <h4 id="george-kittle-te">George Kittle (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Injured Reserve <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> San Francisco has yet to designate Kittle to return from injured reserve, which will need to happen for the tight end to mix into drills. The team resumes practicing Wednesday in advance of next Sunday’s game against the Falcons, meaning the aforementioned transaction may transpire before then. In any case, Kittle appears poised to put the finishing touches on his recovery from the hamstring injury that has sidelined him since Week 1.</p> <h4 id="tony-pollard-rb">Tony Pollard (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Pollard finished with his worst fantasy score of the season in a seemingly promising matchup against the Raiders defense. The veteran starter still led Tennessee’s backfield with 10 carries, finishing five ahead of backup Tyjae Spears. Pollard’s reduced touches were rather the result of a poor game script as opposed to a changing of the guard in Tennessee’s backfield. Fantasy managers should continue treating Pollard as a potential flex option against the Patriots next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="zach-ertz-te">Zach Ertz (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Following a Week 5 blanking at the hands of the Chargers, Ertz enjoyed a noteworthy resurgence in Monday’s narrow loss. The veteran tight end led the Commanders in receptions and targets while checking in behind only Chris Moore in receiving yards. Ertz also posted his first touchdown since Week 2 on a six-yard scoring grab early in the fourth quarter, rounding out an encouraging night that also saw him tie a season high in receptions. He should have a good chance at carrying over his momentum into Week 7, as he’ll face the Cowboys’ vulnerable defense on the road.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_6_2025_EET_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_6_2025_EET_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <h2 id="projected-lineup-for-next-week">Projected Lineup for Next Week</h2> <p><strong>Total Projected Points:</strong> 96.39<br/></p> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_7_2025_EET_projected.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> <th data-field="opponent" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="false">Opponent</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week6"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Mama Daughter Duo Week 6 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-6-JST/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mama Daughter Duo Week 6 Report"/><published>2025-10-15T00:43:46+00:00</published><updated>2025-10-15T00:43:46+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-6-JST</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-6-JST/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Mama Daughter Duo Lost against Third Time’s the Charm? 152.00-165.67<br/> Current Standing: #9<br/> Playoff Chances: 42.7%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 92.4%<br/> Best Performer: Jalen Hurts (25.62 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="emari-demercado-rb">Emari Demercado (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Demercado went to the locker room with a slight limp while favoring his left ankle in the second quarter. He’s part of a backfield committee for the Cardinals along with Michael Carter and Bam Knight with James Conner (foot) and Trey Benson (knee) on injured reserve. Demercado had one carry for one yard and didn’t haul in his only target prior to his exit.</p> <h4 id="michael-penix-jr-qb">Michael Penix Jr. (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Penix outdueled Bills star QB Josh Allen (57.7 completion percentage for 180 yards) on the national stage en route to the Falcons’ third win of the campaign. Bijan Robinson stole the show on offense with 238 yards from scrimmage, but Atlanta’s signal-caller also deserves praise for the upset victory. Penix led an impressive 14-play drive midway through the fourth quarter that ate up most of the remaining clock while deflating Buffalo’s hopes of a comeback. The surging sophomore will look to build on a modest two-game win streak when the Falcons take on the 49ers in Week 7.</p> <h4 id="rome-odunze-wr">Rome Odunze (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Chicago’s Week 5 bye didn’t benefit Odunze, who saw the four-game scoring streak he started the season with end abruptly Monday. The 23-year-old finished fourth for the Bears in receiving as QB Caleb Williams spread the ball around evenly amongst his targets in the win. Odunze was providing WR1 production prior to Monday’s dud, so managers should continue starting the wideout with confidence against the Saints on Sunday.</p> <h4 id="travis-kelce-te">Travis Kelce (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Kelce kept the good times rolling with another positive fantasy result following last week’s 7-61-1 receiving line. The 35-year-old hasn’t posted eye-popping numbers in any particular week, but the consistent production at a shallow position certainly makes fantasy managers’ lives easier when constructing weekly lineups. Kelce will continue operating as one of Patrick Mahomes’ top and most-trusted targets against the Raiders next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="hunter-henry-te">Hunter Henry (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Through six games, Henry has maintained steady playing time while recording a 20-277-3 receiving line on 31 targets. Though his volume has tapered off over his last three outings, the tight end remains a viable red-zone option for QB Drake Maye and a candidate to see increased targets on any given week, when game script and/or game flow dictate.</p> <h4 id="chris-olave-wr">Chris Olave (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The fourth-year wideout nearly produced his first 100-yard performance since Week 8 of last season, but Olave instead had to settle for a season high in receiving yards. He’s been Spencer Rattler’s favorite downfield option by far, seeing double-digit targets in five of six games to begin the campaign en route to a 39-342-1 line on 63 targets overall. Olave will look to stay productive in Week 7 against the Bears.</p> <h4 id="will-shipley-rb">Will Shipley (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Shipley hasn’t been a significant part of the offense at any point this season for the Eagles, but Thursday represented his season-low snap count. He did not touch the ball on offense but did return one kick for 22 yards.</p> <h4 id="devonta-smith-wr">DeVonta Smith (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Smith was third across the board to Dallas Goedert and A.J. Brown in receptions, receiving yards and targets on the night, and his overall numbers represented a significant downturn from his season-best effort against the Broncos on Sunday. Smith recorded exactly half of the receptions and targets he had in that contest, while his yardage tally was a sharp decline from the 114 he managed versus Denver. His first opportunity to bounce back will come against the Vikings in a Week 7 road matchup on Sunday, Oct. 19.</p> <h4 id="jalen-hurts-qb">Jalen Hurts (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Hurts and the Eagles offense had a productive first quarter when they netted 10 points as a unit, and the reigning Super Bowl MVP connected with Dallas Goedert from three yards out late in the period for six of those. Hurts would add a one-yard touchdown run at just under the seven-minute mark of the second quarter, and that would surprisingly be the end of the scoring on the night for Philadelphia. Hurts exceeded 30 pass attempts for a second consecutive contest for the first time this season, and he averaged a season-best 8.6 yards per attempt Thursday while connecting with six different targets. The sixth-year pro’s one interception also was very costly, however, as it came at the Giants’ nine-yard line early in the fourth quarter with the Eagles down 10 and was returned all the way to Philadelphia’s 23-yard line to set up the New York’s game-clinching touchdown. Hurts has hit or exceeded 280 passing yards in each of the last two games heading into a Week 7 road showdown against the Vikings on Sunday, Oct. 19.</p> <h4 id="kaleb-johnson-rb">Kaleb Johnson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Johnson saw six carries during the Steelers’ Week 4 win over the Vikings, and he saw a similar workload following Pittsburgh’s Week 5 bye. Jaylen Warren continues to serve as the team’s clear lead back, but Johnson has seen slightly more opportunities over the past two games. The 22-year-old’s 11 offensive snaps still lagged behind Warren (31) and Kenneth Gainwell (20), and Johnson’s fantasy value will likely remain limited as long as those two remain healthy.</p> <h4 id="dk-metcalf-wr">DK Metcalf (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Metcalf remained Aaron Rodgers’ top target, leading the team in targets and yards. All four of his catches went for 20 yards or more, highlighted by a 25-yard score down the right sideline to kick off the fourth quarter. Even with an additional missed opportunity for a long touchdown due to an underthrow by Rodgers, Metcalf has found the end zone in each of his last four games and has topped 80 receiving yards in three of five contests to begin his tenure with the Steelers.</p> <h4 id="christian-mccaffrey-rb">Christian McCaffrey (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> McCaffrey scored his first regular-season touchdown since the 2023 campaign after being held out of the end zone as a runner over his previous five starts this year and all four healthy appearances in 2024. The dual-threat superstar has been in the doldrums as a pure rusher this season (3.1 YPC), but he has offset that with WR1 production as a receiver (46-444-3). In fact, CMC has finished with more receiving yards than rushing yards in five of his six starts this year, highlighting a peculiar start to his game logs. Fantasy managers could care less how their workhorse gets his numbers so long as the overall production is elite, as it has been all season. McCaffrey will likely be asked to continue shouldering the load for the 49ers’ offense against the Falcons on Sunday Night Football in Week 7.</p> <h4 id="rachaad-white-rb">Rachaad White (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> White got the nod in place of injured starter Bucky Irving (foot/shoulder) for the second consecutive week, rewarding fantasy managers with his third touchdown over that span. The 26-year-old White finished below four yards per carry in both spot-starts, but his nose for the goal line helped cement another strong fantasy score. No. 3 RB Sean Tucker (6-25-1) remained a distant second in carries behind White, but the former was able to vulture a touchdown from the fill-in starter this time around. The Buccaneers have an extra day off before hosting the Lions on Monday Night Football in Week 7, so White’s managers should monitor Irving’s availability leading up to that contest before deciding whether to deploy White in their lineups.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_6_2025_JST_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_6_2025_JST_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <h2 id="projected-lineup-for-next-week">Projected Lineup for Next Week</h2> <p><strong>Total Projected Points:</strong> 141.30<br/></p> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_7_2025_JST_projected.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> <th data-field="opponent" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="false">Opponent</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week6"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">To Infinity and Bijan!

Michael Penix was keyed in on Drake London (10-158-1) and Bijan Robinson (6-68-0) in the passing game, leaving scraps for Pitts and the rest of Atlanta’s auxiliary options. Pitts still carries a modest 23-223-1 receiving line into a Week 7 road tilt against the 49ers on Sunday.</p> <h4 id="mark-andrews-te">Mark Andrews (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The positive for Andrews was that he remained involved in the Baltimore offense, finishing tied for second on the team in targets. He was unable to convert that into much production while catching passes from the combination of Cooper Rush and Tyler Huntley, with his longest gain going for only nine yards. The outlook for all Ravens pass catchers should improve with the anticipated return of Lamar Jackson (hamstring) in Week 8 following the team’s bye, though Andrews could lose out on opportunity to more explosive options such as Rashod Bateman and Isaiah Likely.</p> <h4 id="keon-coleman-wr">Keon Coleman (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Coleman tied for the team lead in receptions and targets, but as his final line indicates, those opportunities were essentially for naught. The second-year wideout has endured an underwhelming season that’s included a Week 5 benching for that game’s opening series, and Coleman notably couldn’t make an impact Monday despite the Bills being without Dalton Kincaid (oblique) and Curtis Samuel (neck/ribs) to begin the game and then losing Joshua Palmer (ankle) during the contest. Coleman and quarterback Josh Allen will have a Week 7 bye to work on their chemistry before returning to action Oct. 26 on the road against the Panthers.</p> <h4 id="tetairoa-mcmillan-wr">Tetairoa McMillan (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> As his final line indicates, the rookie first-round pick made excellent use of his trio of catches, turning two of them into 19- and two-yard touchdown grabs for the first pair of end-zone trips of his career. Otherwise, McMillan’s reception, yardage and target totals all tied or served as new season lows, making it a mixed bag of a day to an extent from a fantasy perspective. Nevertheless, McMillan’s role as Carolina’s No. 1 receiver is as iron clad as it gets, but he’s likely to draw plenty of Sauce Gardner’s attention in a Week 7 visit to the Jets next Sunday afternoon.</p> <h4 id="javonte-williams-rb">Javonte Williams (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Cowboys were forced into a relatively pass-heavy game script as they kept pace with the Panthers. That limited Williams to a season-low 13 carries, but the primary issue was his lack of efficiency. Williams’ longest rush went for only six yards, and his longest reception was good for only nine yards. The positive takeaway is that Williams earned 18 touches and the next closest Dallas back (Jaydon Blue) had only three. Williams should have a strong chance to bounce back in Week 7 against Washington.</p> <h4 id="marvin-mims-jr-wr">Marvin Mims Jr. (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Mims played 21 of the Broncos’ 60 offensive snaps Sunday, behind fellow wide receivers Courtland Sutton (48), Pat Bryant (35) and Troy Franklin (35). The third-year wideout’s 35 percent snap share was his lowest mark of the season. Mims has flashed his play-making ability at times this season, but his inconsistent usage in Denver’s offense makes him extremely difficult to trust for fantasy purposes. The 23-year-old will have his next chance to take a step forward in a Week 7 matchup against the Giants, yet he’ll continue to face stiff competition for targets in a crowded receiving corps.</p> <h4 id="josh-jacobs-rb">Josh Jacobs (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Packers had an efficient offensive day, both on the ground and through the air. Jacobs unsurprisingly led the way as a rusher, ripping off long runs of 16 and 14 yards – the latter of which went for a touchdown to kick off the fourth quarter. He also turned in his third straight game with at least four catches. Despite not reaching 100 rushing yards in any game, Jacobs has found the end zone six times in five contests and remains one of the most reliable fantasy contributors at running back.</p> <h4 id="quentin-johnston-wr">Quentin Johnston (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable</p> <h4 id="carson-wentz-qb">Carson Wentz (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Wentz contended with soreness in his non-throwing shoulder during the Vikings’ Oct. 6 win over the Browns in London, but he was able to finish out the contest. He appears to have made some progress in his recovery over the Vikings’ Week 7 bye, though it won’t be clear until Wednesday whether he’s participating in practice as a full participant. J.J. McCarthy (ankle) also returned to practice Monday for the first time since Sept. 14, so even if his shoulder proves to be a non-issue, Wentz may move to the bench for Sunday’s game against the Eagles after starting in each of the previous three games. The Vikings will likely gauge the health of McCarthy and Wentz throughout the week of practice before announcing a starter for Sunday.</p> <h4 id="justin-jefferson-wr">Justin Jefferson (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Jefferson paced the Vikings in receptions, receiving yards and targets on the day, turning in his second consecutive 100-yard effort in the process. His final reception of the contest was especially critical, as he came down with a 21-yard grab to take the ball to the Browns’ 27 yard-line with under two minutes remaining on Minnesota’s game-winning drive. Jefferson has displayed excellent chemistry with fill-in signal-caller Carson Wentz over the last pair of contests, but J.J. McCarthy (ankle) may be set to return to action when the Vikings come out of a Week 6 bye to host the Eagles on Sunday, Oct. 19.</p> <h4 id="theo-johnson-te">Theo Johnson (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Johnson had flashed with a season-high six receptions and a pair of touchdowns in the Week 5 loss to the Saints on Sunday, but he was a lot quieter four days later despite the Giants’ successful night on offense. Nevertheless, he finished with at least four targets for the third straight game, and he appears to have a solid rapport with rookie signal-caller Jaxson Dart heading into a challenging Week 7 road matchup against the Broncos on Sunday, Oct. 19.</p> <h4 id="justin-fields-qb">Justin Fields (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Coach Aaron Glenn admitted Monday that Fields, who completed just nine of 17 pass attempts for 45 yards while absorbing nine sacks, “took a step back” in Sunday’s 13-11 loss to the Broncos in London, but the current plan is to stick with the 26-year-old under center. Behind Fields on the depth chart are 36-year-old Tyrod Taylor, who is a known commodity as a reliable veteran backup at this stage of his career, and undrafted rookie Brady Cook on the practice squad. Taylor isn’t a long-term answer, and Cook likely isn’t ready for regular-season NFL action. Things could change if Fields doesn’t rebound and show signs of improvement.</p> <h4 id="chris-godwin-jr-wr">Chris Godwin Jr. (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Doubtful <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> doubtful</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_6_2025_TIB_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_6_2025_TIB_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <h2 id="projected-lineup-for-next-week">Projected Lineup for Next Week</h2> <p><strong>Total Projected Points:</strong> 127.26<br/></p> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_7_2025_TIB_projected.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> <th data-field="opponent" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="false">Opponent</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week6"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">90s MonCon Week 6 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-6-90s/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="90s MonCon Week 6 Report"/><published>2025-10-15T00:43:45+00:00</published><updated>2025-10-15T00:43:45+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-6-90s</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-6-90s/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>90s MonCon Lost against Emma’s Excellent Team 67.71-89.62<br/> Current Standing: #7<br/> Playoff Chances: 57.7%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 89.2%<br/> Best Performer: Jonathan Taylor (21.70 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="michael-carter-rb">Michael Carter (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Prior to the game, it was announced that Bam Knight would serve in the lead-back role, theoretically relegating Carter to complementary duties. However, Carter ended up lagging just two carries behind Knight while equaling his teammate’s rushing yardage, and he provided a nice chunk play as a receiver with a 16-yard catch. Although Knight did score a short rushing touchdown, the gap between the two players doesn’t seem to be much heading into a Week 7 home matchup against the Packers next Sunday afternoon.</p> <h4 id="lamar-jackson-qb">Lamar Jackson (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Out <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Jackson has missed Baltimore’s last two games, but Harbaugh indicated Sunday that his hope and expectation is that the star QB will be available for the team’s Oct. 26 game against the Bears. The looming return of Jackson, among others, in Week 8 offers hope that a turnaround can be engineering by the Ravens, who head into their bye week with a 1-5 record. Either way, if Jackson is healthy, he belongs in fantasy lineups.</p> <h4 id="dillon-gabriel-qb">Dillon Gabriel (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Gabriel was constantly under pressure, taking six sacks while averaging only 4.25 yards per attempt. Positively, he did continue to show a connection with fellow rookie tight end Harold Fannin, as the duo connected for a 25-yard gain – the longest of the day for both Gabriel and the team. Gabriel should have the chance to put together a better performance in Week 7 when the Browns host the Dolphins.</p> <h4 id="quinshon-judkins-rb">Quinshon Judkins (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Browns fell behind early in the game and took to the air 52 times in a comeback effort. That limited Judkins’ opportunity, and he also lost out on touches to Jerome Ford as a pass catcher. Judkins also suffered from an efficiency perspective, with his longest gain of the day going for only six yards. The Browns should be in a more neutral game script in Week 7 against Miami, so Judkins is likely to be in for a bounce-back performance.</p> <h4 id="jameson-williams-wr">Jameson Williams (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Williams finally put together a strong showing, leading the Lions in receiving yards while finding the end zone for the first time since Week 2. His touchdown catch was his longest of the day, as he caught a pass deep across the middle of the field before crashing through several defenders for a 22-yard score. Williams also tallied a pair of 15-yard gains to help him surpass 50 receiving yards in a game for only the second time this season.</p> <h4 id="jonathan-taylor-rb">Jonathan Taylor (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Taylor put together another signature stat line, averaging 5.9 yards per carry on his way to his second-highest rushing yardage total of the season. He also scored his fourth touchdown of the last two games on a one-yard rush with under five minutes remaining to erase a 27-24 deficit and put the final points of the day up on the board. Taylor is already sitting on 603 rushing yards, seven rush TDs and an average of 5.3 yards per carry through six contests, and he’ll face the Chargers’ porous run defense in a Week 7 road showdown next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="brock-bowers-te">Brock Bowers (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable</p> <h4 id="tua-tagovailoa-qb">Tua Tagovailoa (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Tagovailoa’s turnover issues persisted in the narrow loss, although the last of his three interceptions came on a last-gasp play to close out the contest. The 2020 first-round pick’s first two INTs were much more ill-timed, as Tagovailoa short-circuited drives at the Chargers’ 39-yard line and his own 37, which led to 10 points for Los Angeles. Tagovailoa did lead Miami to two fourth-quarter touchdown drives and capped the second one off with a seven-yard scoring toss to Darren Waller with 46 seconds remaining, but he also undeniably played a direct part in the Dolphins falling to 1-5. Tagovailoa’s Week 7 matchup is far from ideal in terms of his quest to atone for the turnover-filled performance, as a road trip to Cleveland to face the Browns’ aggressive defense awaits.</p> <h4 id="jaylen-waddle-wr">Jaylen Waddle (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Waddle fell just short of his second consecutive 100-yard effort, but he still led the Dolphins in receptions, receiving yards and targets on the afternoon. The 2021 first-round pick has unsurprisingly seen an uptick in involvement during the first two full games Miami has played without Tyreek Hill (IR, knee), posting a combined 12-205-1 receiving line on 17 targets in that pair of contests. Waddle’s clear-cut No. 1 receiver role should persist in a Week 7 road matchup against a talented Browns defense.</p> <h4 id="jordan-addison-wr">Jordan Addison (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Kevin Seifert of ESPN.com reported Addison was subject to a first-quarter benching for undisclosed reasons, but the third-year wideout ultimately would make up for lost time in clutch fashion. Addison was efficient with his opportunities, and the bulk of those came at the tail end of the Vikings’ game-winning drive late in the fourth quarter. Addison was on the receiving end of each of Carson Wentz’s final three completions and totaled 21 yards on those catches, the last which was a go-ahead 12-yard touchdown grab. For his part, Addison conceded afterward that he wasn’t sure if he’d even be able to play in the game, per Seifert, but he made good on his vow to be ready if he did step on the field. Following the completion of his season-opening three-game suspension, Addison has immediately played a key part in Minnesota’s air attack with a 9-155-1 line on 14 targets over his first two contests. He’ll now prepare to play his first 2025 game stateside following the Week 6 bye when the Vikings host the Eagles on Sunday, Oct. 19 in a contest that could also provide Addison his first regular-season opportunity to work with J.J. McCarthy (ankle) as his quarterback.</p> <h4 id="jordan-mason-rb">Jordan Mason (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Mason’s rushing opportunities were limited, but he locked in a solid fantasy day with a three-yard touchdown run to cap off the first drive of the second half. The offseason addition generally found tough sledding on the ground outside of the short score and his game-long 14-yard run, but he continued to keep Minnesota’s ground attack viable in the ongoing absence of Aaron Jones (IR, hamstring). Mason should be in line to remain the lead back when the Vikings come out of the Week 6 bye with a Week 7 home matchup against the Eagles on Sunday, Oct. 19.</p> <h4 id="garrett-wilson-wr">Garrett Wilson (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Doubtful <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Confirmation from the team has yet to come, but at a minimum it looks like the Jets are in line to be without their top pass catcher this weekend against the Panthers. If that’s the case, Josh Reynolds, Arian Smith, Allen Lazard (personal) and Tyler Johnson would be candidates to see added WR reps in Wilson’s absence.</p> <h4 id="jaylen-warren-rb">Jaylen Warren (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Warren returned from a one-game absence caused by a knee injury with his role in question due to competition from Kenneth Gainwell. Warren comfortably led the team with 11 carries, though he gave up a considerable amount of work to Gainwell in the receiving game. He was efficient with his work, but Warren appears to be the leader of a committee in Pittsburgh rather than a true lead back for the time being.</p> <h4 id="jauan-jennings-wr">Jauan Jennings (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Jennings missed Week 5 against the Rams with the injury but returned to the lineup Sunday against Tampa Bay. However, he was almost nonexistent in the box score, finishing with just one catch for seven yards as an afterthought in the passing game. Jennings didn’t look anywhere near 100 percent health. Kendrick Bourne turned in another stellar performance, securing five of nine targets for 142 yards as Mac Jones’ preferred go-to option. Jennings will be hard to trust in fantasy lineups next Sunday against Atlanta.</p> <h4 id="aj-barner-te">AJ Barner (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Barner finished in the relatively unfamiliar position of second in receiving yardage and tied with Jaxon Smith-Njigba for the longest reception of the game. That catch covered a distance of 61 yards on the first play of Seattle’s game-clinching drive, with Barner getting loose down the middle of the field after making the reception and taking the ball down to the Jaguars’ 12-yard line. Barner has now set new single-game season highs in receiving yards in three consecutive contests, but he’s typically much more of a shorter-area target for Sam Darnold and will remain a complementary pass-catching option in a tough Week 7 home matchup against the Texans on Monday night, Oct. 20.</p> <h4 id="tyjae-spears-rb">Tyjae Spears (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Spears more than doubled his total touches in his second game back from an ankle injury. Tony Pollard (10-34-0) still spearheaded the Titans’ backfield, but the gap in touch distribution inched even closer Sunday. The speedy backup will continue vying for more snaps against the Patriots next Sunday.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_6_2025_90s_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_6_2025_90s_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <h2 id="projected-lineup-for-next-week">Projected Lineup for Next Week</h2> <p><strong>Total Projected Points:</strong> 138.03<br/></p> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_7_2025_90s_projected.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> <th data-field="opponent" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="false">Opponent</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week6"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Rookie Mistake Week 6 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-6-TOM/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Rookie Mistake Week 6 Report"/><published>2025-10-15T00:43:45+00:00</published><updated>2025-10-15T00:43:45+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-6-TOM</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-6-TOM/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Rookie Mistake Lost against Michael’s Managable Team 115.52-132.15<br/> Current Standing: #8<br/> Playoff Chances: 33.1%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 87.1%<br/> Best Performer: Jared Goff (26.32 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

However, he failed to draw a target for the first time this season after not hauling in the one pass thrown his way Week 5, a relatively rare slump for him as a pass catcher. Cook’s fantasy value remains significantly elevated in all formats, however, and he draws a favorable matchup on the road against the Panthers on Sunday, Oct. 26 following Buffalo’s Week 7 bye.</p> <h4 id="jk-dobbins-rb">J.K. Dobbins (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Denver’s entire backfield struggled to find running lanes Sunday, with no tailbacks finishing with a per-carry average higher than 3.0 yards in the win. Dobbins still comfortably led the Broncos with 14 rushing attempts, 12 more than rookie backup RJ Harvey. This was easily Dobbins’ worst fantasy score of the season after providing managers with five weeks of consistent RB2 production. The veteran starter has an excellent opportunity to get back on track in Week 7 against the Giants, who currently are surrendering 128.8 rushing yards per game thus far this season.</p> <h4 id="jared-goff-qb">Jared Goff (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Goff had an interesting start to the game, as he had a touchdown catch nullified by a penalty on Detroit’s opening possession. He was out-dueled by Patrick Mahomes from there, but he still turned in a decent performance, highlighted by three completions at least 20 yards – including a 22-yard touchdown connection with Jameson Williams. Goff now has multiple scores in each of his last three games.</p> <h4 id="romeo-doubs-wr">Romeo Doubs (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Doubs was Jordan Love’s top target in Sunday’s win, leading the team in targets. He converted that into his third performance of 50 or more receiving yards this season, thanks to long gains of 21 and 15 yards. Doubs isn’t likely to turn in huge fantasy performances often thanks to the emergence of Matthew Golden and Tucker Kraft, but it’s clear he has rapport and the trust of Love, which should be enough to keep Doubs involved in the offense.</p> <h4 id="matthew-golden-wr">Matthew Golden (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Golden continues to get more involved in the Green Bay offense, as he’s now earned at least five targets in each of his last three games. He was impressive with the opportunity, ripping off long gains of 35 and 31 yards, the latter of which all but clinched a win for the Packers. Golden topped 100 yards from scrimmage for the first time in his career while showcasing his ability to work deep down the field and also pick up yards after the catch. He appears to be earning trust from coaches and Jordan Love, which should lead to more consistent usage as the season progresses.</p> <h4 id="tyler-warren-te">Tyler Warren (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Warren tied Josh Downs for the team lead in receptions and led the way in both receiving yards and targets on an afternoon where he also recorded his second touchdown grab of the season. Warren found the end zone from eight yards out to cap off the opening possession of the game, and he tallied his fifth catch of 20-plus yards this season earlier in the drive with a 23-yard reception. The rookie tight end will continue to serve as a focal point of the offense during a Week 7 marquee road matchup against the Chargers.</p> <h4 id="travis-hunter-wr">Travis Hunter (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> After consecutive encouraging performances during which Hunter generated a combined 6-106-0 receiving line on eight targets, the rookie second overall pick was back to a very modest, low-upside role Sunday. All but one yard of Hunter’s tally came on one catch, underscoring how he didn’t have any sort of downfield profile. Although he developed a well-earned college reputation for being an explosive player who can offer plenty at deeper depths of target than what he’s been seeing, Hunter is surprisingly stuck in a limited role despite head coach Liam Coen’s typically creative offensive designs.</p> <h4 id="ashton-jeanty-rb">Ashton Jeanty (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Jeanty ground out a solid fantasy day by scoring his third rushing touchdown of the year on a season-high 23 carries. Veteran backup Raheem Mostert (five carries) was the only other rusher to record a touch in the win, highlighting Jeanty’s stranglehold on the every-down role out of Las Vegas’ backfield. The sixth overall pick from this year’s draft has generated 497 combined yards from scrimmage with five total touchdowns through six starts in 2025. Jeanty’s offensive involvement has increased with an average of 22.3 touches over the Raiders’ last three contests. Fantasy managers can start the Boise State product with confidence for next Sunday’s road tilt against the Chiefs.</p> <h4 id="omarion-hampton-rb">Omarion Hampton (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Injured Reserve <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Chargers head coach Jim Harbaugh didn’t provide many details about the injury Hampton sustained in the Week 5 loss to the Commanders, but the fact that the promising rookie is expected to need more than four weeks to make a full recovery points to him likely nursing a high-ankle sprain. A target date for Hampton’s return has yet to be established, but because the Chargers have a bye coming up in Week 12, the team could be motivated to hold him out through that period to give him ample time to heal. Garafolo notes that Hassan Haskins is likely to serve as the Chargers’ lead back Sunday in Miami while practice-squad signee Kimani Vidal also sees work, but Los Angeles is also expected to be in the market for a running back ahead of the Nov. 4 trade deadline to compensate for the long-term injuries to Hampton and Najee Harris (Achilles).</p> <h4 id="ollie-gordon-ii-rb">Ollie Gordon II (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Gordon once again struggled to display efficiency while operating as the Dolphins’ top reserve backfield option, while starter De’Von Achane gashed Los Angeles with 16 carries for 128 rushing yards (8.0 YPC) and two scores, adding four grabs for 22 yards in the receiving game (six targets). At this stage, Gordon retains fantasy value purely as a handcuff in deeper formats, as his availability has rendered Jaylen Wright a healthy scratch. The rookie sixth-round pick faces a rough matchup on the road against Cleveland in Week 7.</p> <h4 id="jaxson-dart-qb">Jaxson Dart (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Dart recorded the first signature win of his nascent career with a standout, mistake-free performance. The dynamic rookie got off to a blistering start by helping lead two first-quarter touchdown drives, possessions he capped off with a 20-yard scoring run and a 35-yard strike to Wan’Dale Robinson. Dart went on to lead three more scoring drives in the upset, and he navigated a brief third-quarter exit to be checked for a concussion to finish out the upset victory without incident. Dart has already shown considerable promise in his first three starts while recording a pair of victories in the process. but he’ll get quite the test in a Week 7 road matchup against the Broncos on Sunday, Oct. 19.</p> <h4 id="jake-tonges-te">Jake Tonges (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Tonges continued doing his best George Kittle (hamstring) impression in another effective spot-start Sunday. The 25-year-old Tonges has been a pleasant surprise in fantasy during his brief run as the starter, posting a 25-223-3 receiving line through six games. David Lombardi of SFStandard.com reported that Kittle could return from injured reserve in Week 7, which would effectively end Tonges’ run of utility. Managers should wait until Kittle is officially activated before making any rash decisions regarding Tonges in Week 7 and onward.</p> <h4 id="mac-jones-qb">Mac Jones (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Jones toughed out a pair of injuries and another week of limited practices in order to start for a shorthanded 49ers squad Sunday. The veteran backup was unable to earn his fourth win in as many appearances with San Francisco, but he did produce a season-high 347 passing yards for fantasy managers. The Alabama product is averaging a whopping 313.0 yards per game with a 2:1 TD:INT in place of starter Brock Purdy (toe/shoulder) this season. The latter’s status is currently unclear for Week 7, but Jones has certainly played well enough in Purdy’s stead to warrant fantasy consideration if he remains under center against the Falcons for Sunday Night Football.</p> <h4 id="chig-okonkwo-te">Chig Okonkwo (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Okonkwo’s six targets Sunday tied his previous season high, while the six grabs set a new high-water mark through six starts. Aside from a one-catch dud in Week 4, the veteran tight end has carved out a consistent role in the passing game. Okonkwo will carry a 23-218-0 receiving line into next Sunday’s tilt against the Patriots.</p> <h4 id="elic-ayomanor-wr">Elic Ayomanor (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Ayomanor produced his third underwhelming performance in a row as the Titans returned to their losing ways in 2025. The lack of production from the rookie is especially concerning considering that No. 1 wideout Calvin Ridley (hamstring) left the contest early and did not return. Van Jefferson (4-75-0) wound up taking advantage instead and finished as Tennessee’s leading receiver. That said, if Ridley is forced to miss next Sunday’s tilt against the Patriots, Ayomanor may have a prime opportunity to return to the form that made him a hot pickup early in the campaign.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_6_2025_TOM_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_6_2025_TOM_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <h2 id="projected-lineup-for-next-week">Projected Lineup for Next Week</h2> <p><strong>Total Projected Points:</strong> 93.93<br/></p> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_7_2025_TOM_projected.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> <th data-field="opponent" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="false">Opponent</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week6"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Abbey’s TNT Team Week 6 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-6-ARV/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Abbey’s TNT Team Week 6 Report"/><published>2025-10-15T00:43:44+00:00</published><updated>2025-10-15T00:43:44+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-6-ARV</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-6-ARV/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Abbey’s TNT Team 🧨 Won against To Infinity and Bijan! 97.27-65.20<br/> Current Standing: #4<br/> Playoff Chances: 68.0%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 93.7%<br/> Best Performer: Bijan Robinson (32.80 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

The majority of the fantasy star’s production came on the ground this time around, with Monday’s 170 rushing yards representing another career best. Robinson is providing a whopping 164.4 combined yards per game for his managers this season. To put that into perspective, the Texas product averaged 111.0 total yards per game over the course of his breakout fantasy campaign in 2024. Robinson’s domination of opposing defenses should continue Week 7 against a 49ers defense that will be without star players Fred Warner (ankle) and Nick Bosa (knee).</p> <h4 id="xavier-legette-wr">Xavier Legette (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Since returning from injury in Carolina’s Week 5 win over the Dolphins, Legette has been targeted just five times, catching four passes for 42 yards and a touchdown over the team’s last two games. He was outpaced by rookie wideouts Tetairoa McMillan (3-39-2) and Jimmy Horn (2-36-0), finishing sixth on the team in receiving yards during Sunday’s victory. Although the second-year pro continues to operate as the Panthers’ No. 2 wide receiver, his involvement has been limited, with most of the team’s offensive production coming from McMillan and Rico Dowdle. Legette draws another great matchup in Week 7 against a struggling Jets defense, but he’s still unlikely to make a meaningful fantasy impact.</p> <h4 id="colston-loveland-te">Colston Loveland (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Loveland has five receptions this season, and limited usage keeps him a watch-list tight end until his usage increases.</p> <h4 id="dylan-sampson-rb">Dylan Sampson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Sampson had his highest usage since Week 1, including a turn as the primary kickoff returner. Once Quinshon Judkins was established as the lead back, Sampson’s role evaporated. He had just four touches over the last three weeks, while getting single-digit snaps in all three contests.</p> <h4 id="jaydon-blue-rb">Jaydon Blue (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The rookie running back saw only five snaps (nine percent) on offense as Javonte Williams continues to dominate the workload in the Dallas backfield. Blue did gain 40 yards on two kickoff returns, but even that role will disappear once KaVontae Turpin (foot) gets healthy. Blue’s only fantasy value right is as insurance against a Williams injury.</p> <h4 id="bo-nix-qb">Bo Nix (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Nix played the role of game manager for Denver in a gritty defensive victory overseas in London. The 25-year-old did not complete a pass for the entirety of the third quarter, which helped contribute to his second-lowest yardage output as a passer this season. On the bright side, Nix was involved in the only touchdown scored for either side Sunday, delivering a 16-yard strike to TE Nate Adkins in the first quarter. With nine touchdowns thrown to four interceptions through six starts, Nix checks in as a middling fantasy option in Week 7 when the Broncos host the Giants next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="kalif-raymond-wr">Kalif Raymond (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Raymond was cleared to play after suffering a neck injury in Week 5, but he only logged two snaps on offense and one snap with the special-teams unit. The wide receiver will look to be more involved Week 7 versus the Buccaneers after having an additional week to return to form following his injury.</p> <h4 id="geno-smith-qb">Geno Smith (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Smith got the Raiders back in the win column after a recent poor string of play had critics calling for a quarterback change in Las Vegas. The veteran signal-caller appears to have staved off a potential QB controversy with improved play against a struggling Titans squad Sunday. The 34-year-old still couldn’t pitch a clean outing, throwing his 10th interception of campaign early in the fourth quarter. The late turnover didn’t cost his team a chance at victory, meaning Smith should remain under center for a tough road matchup against the Chiefs next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="puka-nacua-wr">Puka Nacua (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The star wideout suffered a left ankle sprain during Sunday’s 17-3 win at Baltimore, but Nacua being described in such a manner by McVay is a touch more optimistic than a report from Ian Rapoport of NFL Network that suggested he’s set to miss time. Nacua’s status appears uncertain at best for Los Angeles’ matchup against the Jaguars in London in Week 7, and a Week 8 bye could nudge the team in the direction of caution. McVay hasn’t ruled Nacua out yet for this coming Sunday’s game, Dragon confirms, so final clarity on his status likely won’t arrive until the Rams have had a chance to evaluate him at practice. Stu Jackson of the team’s official site reports that scans have indicated Nacua isn’t dealing with a long-term injury.</p> <h4 id="kyren-williams-rb">Kyren Williams (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Rams possessed the ball for only 22:05 of game time while averaging only 4.7 yards per play. That led to modest stat lines for the entire skills corps, though Williams was on the better end of things thanks to a three-yard touchdown run early in the third quarter. One play earlier, he made a falling 30-yard reception on fourth down that kept the drive alive. Overall, Williams delivered a well-rounded stat line and also kept the ball secure after losing a fumble in each of his last two games.</p> <h4 id="kendre-miller-rb">Kendre Miller (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> After back-to-back games with double-digit carries, Miller was stonewalled for his second-least efficient rushing performance of the season. The third-year running back has now averaged 7.6 carries per game this season. Over the last three games, he’s averaging 9.6 rushing attempts for 42.3 yards per contest while operating as the No. 2 running back behind Alvin Kamara. Miller will look to remain involved in his backup role during the Week 7 matchup versus the Bears on Sunday, Sept. 19.</p> <h4 id="tank-bigsby-rb">Tank Bigsby (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Bigsby hasn’t played a single offensive snap since being acquired by the Eagles after Week 1. He’s the fourth running back on the Eagles’ depth chart, so even an injury to Saquon Barkley likely wouldn’t be enough for him to move into a meaningful role.</p> <h4 id="emeka-egbuka-wr">Emeka Egbuka (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Egbuka secured two of four targets for 24 yards before being forced out Sunday, a contest in which the Buccaneers were missing Mike Evans (hamstring) and Chris Godwin (fibula), as well as top running back Bucky Irving (shoulder). It would be a significant blow for the offense if Egbuka is unable to return for a road Monday Night Football matchup against the Lions in Week 7, as the rookie phenom has racked up a 25-445-5 line on 38 targets. With Egbuka, Evans and Godwin all uncertain to play, Sterling Shepard, Tez Johnson, Kameron Johnson and tight end Cade Otton could be positioned as Baker Mayfield’s top receiving options versus Detroit.</p> <h4 id="cade-otton-te">Cade Otton (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Otton paced the Buccaneers in targets and receptions while finishing with his second-highest yardage total of the season. Part of the reason the tight end was featured so prominently Sunday was the early departure of star rookie Emeka Egbuka. Otton remained scoreless through six starts, but he is getting involved downfield more often as Tampa Bay deals with injuries at the wideout position. Otton will look to build a hot streak with another strong showing against the Lions next Monday.</p> <h4 id="calvin-ridley-wr">Calvin Ridley (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Ridley thus ends his day with one catch (on one target) for 18 yards, while Elic Ayomanor, Chimere Dike, Tyler Lockett and Van Jefferson will handle the Titans’ WR duties in his absence for the remainder of the contest. Ridley’s next chance to see game action will arrive Oct. 19 against the Patriots.</p> <h4 id="deebo-samuel-wr">Deebo Samuel (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Samuel wasn’t at 100 percent, and although Jayden Daniels kept him involved, the veteran receiver couldn’t do much with his opportunities. Samuel posted his second-lowest receiving yardage total of the season, but his injury seemed to play a role. The seven-year pro will look to get healthier ahead of a key Week 7 road matchup against the Cowboys on Sunday.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_6_2025_ARV_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_6_2025_ARV_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <h2 id="projected-lineup-for-next-week">Projected Lineup for Next Week</h2> <p><strong>Total Projected Points:</strong> 104.64<br/></p> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_7_2025_ARV_projected.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> <th data-field="opponent" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="false">Opponent</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week6"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Mcconky Donkeys Week 6 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-6-KTT/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mcconky Donkeys Week 6 Report"/><published>2025-10-15T00:43:44+00:00</published><updated>2025-10-15T00:43:44+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-6-KTT</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-6-KTT/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Mcconky Donkeys Won against Big Titi Energy 153.43-87.79<br/> Current Standing: #5<br/> Playoff Chances: 70.3%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 89.3%<br/> Best Performer: Jayden Daniels (30.14 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="tyler-allgeier-rb">Tyler Allgeier (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Allgeier got involved in the box score early with a 21-yard touchdown scamper on Atlanta’s opening possession. The talented backup then took a back seat to starter Bijan Robinson, who ripped apart Buffalo’s defense to the tune of 238 yards and a score of his own. Allgeier has generated some flex appeal after hitting pay dirt thrice over his last four appearances. There is a four-yard dud nestled in between, so fantasy managers should also be aware of Allgeier’s drastic floor ahead of Sunday’s tilt against San Francisco.</p> <h4 id="david-njoku-te">David Njoku (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Browns initially reported that Njoku was dealing with a thigh issue. Either way, the tight end’s status will need to be monitored ahead of next weekend’s game against the Dolphins. In the event that Njoku is sidelined further, Harold Fannin would be in line to see added TE targets, with Blake Whiteheart mixing in as well.</p> <h4 id="troy-franklin-wr">Troy Franklin (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Franklin’s day in London got off to a rubbish start when he coughed up the first fumble of his career on his first reception of the contest. The silver lining for fantasy managers was that the wideout remained involved offensively following the turnover, receiving three more touches in the narrow win. Franklin has shown flashes of upside early in his sophomore campaign, but Sunday’s dud is an example of the inconsistency he can exhibit. The 22-year-old’s value is likely limited to deeper formats in next Sunday’s tilt against the Giants.</p> <h4 id="evan-engram-te">Evan Engram (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Engram led Denver in targets, receptions and yardage in an odd victory that saw No. 1 WR Courtland Sutton finish with just one reception. The 30-year-old Engram also recorded his first rushing attempt of the season, something we haven’t seen consistently from the tight end since his early years as a member of the New York Giants. Sunday’s solid showing overseas comes on the heels of the veteran tight end’s first touchdown of the year against the Eagles last week. Managers in need of help at the tight-end position should take a serious look at the ascending Engram in Week 7 when the Broncos host the aforementioned Giants next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="joe-mixon-rb">Joe Mixon (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Out <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Caserio’s comments during his press conference mark the first time that a member of the Houston brass has addressed Mixon’s status since the start of the regular season. The veteran running back was placed on the non-football injury list ahead of training camp after getting hurt during an individual workout in the spring, and the Texans have been non-committal on a timeline for his return ever since. Given that the Texans aren’t yet hinting that Mixon will even resume practicing in the near future, the 29-year-old doesn’t look like he’s on track to be an option in the Houston backfield until late in the season, if at all. The Texans are likely to continue to lean on a timeshare of Nick Chubb and rookie Woody Marks at running back for the foreseeable future.</p> <h4 id="brian-thomas-jr-wr">Brian Thomas Jr. (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Thomas led the Jaguars’ pass catchers across the board in receptions, receiving yards and targets, one-upping the then season-best 80-yard effort he’d posted against the Chiefs on Monday night. The second-year wideout also scored his long-awaited first touchdown of the campaign via a 21-yard grab late in the first quarter that opened the scoring on the afternoon. Thomas has started to find some equilibrium in his production over the last three games, and he’ll aim to extend the momentum in a Week 7 matchup against the Rams in London.</p> <h4 id="rashee-rice-wr">Rashee Rice (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> While the Chiefs have been granted a roster exemption for Rice that expires Oct. 20 and thus will need to officially activate him by Saturday in order for him to play Week 7, at this time there’s no reason to believe that won’t occur. The looming return of Rice should provide a major boost to the offense of the 3-3 Chiefs, and assuming no issues at practice this week, the 2023 second-rounder should immediately step into a prominent role in a WR corps that also includes Xavier Worthy, Hollywood Brown, JuJu Smith-Schuster and Tyquan Thornton.</p> <h4 id="isiah-pacheco-rb">Isiah Pacheco (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Pacheco finished Sunday’s win as the Chiefs’ leading rusher, garnering six more touches than veteran backup Kareem Hunt (6-23-0). The 26-year-old Pacheco had been mired in an even timeshare for most of the season, so Sunday’s disparity in touches could be something to monitor moving forward. Pacheco would need that hypothetical increase in usage in order to develop into a reliable starting option in fantasy. Until then, treat the physical runner as nothing more than a flex option against the Raiders next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="ladd-mcconkey-wr">Ladd McConkey (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> McConkey’s 42-yard reception on the final possession with under a minute to go was the catalyst for the game-winning field goal just three plays later, but the second-year wideout benefitted significantly in the absence of Quentin Johnston (hamstring) by leading the team in receiving yards, targets and receptions for the first time this season. This kind of workload could be the status quo for the foreseeable future as Los Angeles struggles to deal with a litany of injuries, whether to rookie running back Omarion Hampton (ankle), Johnston or a bevy of injured offensive lineman.</p> <h4 id="devon-achane-rb">De’Von Achane (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Achane had been uncharacteristically bottled up by the Panthers in Week 5, but the electric back set an early tone Sunday with a 49-yard breakaway touchdown run with just over four minutes remaining in the first quarter. He’d go on to add a four-yard scoring scamper with just under eight minutes left in the contest, a score that narrowed a 26-13 deficit. Achane eclipsed the century mark for the first time this season with Sunday’s production, and his carry total was his second highest through the first six contests. The third-year back should play a key role again during a Week 7 road clash against the tough Browns defense.</p> <h4 id="darius-slayton-wr">Darius Slayton (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable</p> <h4 id="wandale-robinson-wr">Wan’Dale Robinson (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Robinson’s catch and yardage totals were both team highs for the Giants on the night, and his target tally was second only to that of Lil’Jordan Humphrey. The highlight of Robinson’s night was his 35-yard touchdown reception in the first quarter, his second score of the campaign. Robinson now has seen seven targets apiece in his first two full games without Malik Nabers (IR, knee), and his involvement should remain elevated during a tough Week 7 road matchup against the Broncos on Sunday, Oct. 19.</p> <h4 id="aaron-rodgers-qb">Aaron Rodgers (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Rodgers had one of his better showings of the season, completing five passes of at least 20 yards. Four of those went to DK Metcalf, including a 25-yard touchdown down the right sideline to begin the fourth quarter. Rodgers has had a mixed start to his tenure with the Steelers, though he’s averaged over 7.5 yards per attempt in three of five games this season, with Sunday also marking his third multi-touchdown performance of the campaign.</p> <h4 id="mike-evans-wr">Mike Evans (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable</p> <h4 id="baker-mayfield-qb">Baker Mayfield (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Mayfield produced a sterling 139.0 passer rating against a 49ers defense that was helpless after losing LB Fred Warner (ankle) early in the contest. The Buccaneers also suffered a key loss early on when WR Emeka Egbuka (hamstring) exited the game after recording just two receptions. This meant that Mayfield had to finish off the win sans his three top weapons, with Mike Evans (hamstring) and Chris Godwin (fibula) in street clothes Sunday. The 30-year-old Mayfield overcame expectations and produced his fifth multi-score game through six starts. With the Buccaneers visiting the Lions on Monday Night Football in Week 7, it will be important for fantasy managers to note which receivers Mayfield will have at his disposal before making roster decisions.</p> <h4 id="tyler-lockett-wr">Tyler Lockett (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Lockett’s snap rate remained depressed for the second straight game, as he was on the field for only 32 percent of offensive snaps. He was still targeted three times, though his lone catch went for no gain. Lockett has posted at least 10 receiving yards in a game only once this season.</p> <h4 id="jayden-daniels-qb">Jayden Daniels (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> As his collection of numbers indicates, it was a mixed bag of a night for Daniels in his second game back from a knee sprain that cost him a pair of contests. The second-year signal-caller threw a season-high three touchdown passes, connecting with Chris Moore (22 yards), Luke McCaffrey (33 yards) and Zach Ertz (six yards) to erase 13-0 and 16-10 deficits. However, Daniels’ first-quarter interception, his first of the season, led to a Bears field goal, and his fumble at Chicago’s 45-yard line on an attempted handoff to Jacory Croskey-Merritt with 3:10 remaining and Washington clinging to a two-point lead would eventually result in a game-winning field goal by opposing kicker Jake Moody. Daniels also took three sacks, and this was his first multi-turnover tally of the season. The star quarterback and his teammates don’t have time to dwell on the last-second defeat, however, as a road date with the arch-rival Cowboys awaits Sunday afternoon.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_6_2025_KTT_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_6_2025_KTT_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <h2 id="projected-lineup-for-next-week">Projected Lineup for Next Week</h2> <p><strong>Total Projected Points:</strong> 137.37<br/></p> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_7_2025_KTT_projected.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> <th data-field="opponent" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="false">Opponent</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week6"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry></feed>
