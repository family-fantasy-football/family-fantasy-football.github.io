</code></pre> <hr/> <h2 id="-player-report">🏥 Player Report</h2> <h3 id="-jacoby-brissett-qb">🟢 Jacoby Brissett (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Making his second straight start in place of Kyler Murray (foot), Brissett had another productive performance as he connected with Trey McBride for a 15-yard score in the second quarter and a 12-yard strike in the third. The veteran QB has thrown for 599 yards in place of Murray -- the best two-game stretch of his career -- with a 4:1 TD:INT, but with Arizona on bye in Week 8, Brissett may be returning to the bench for a Week 9 tilt against the Cowboys' porous defense. </div> <h3 id="-roschon-johnson-rb">🟢 Roschon Johnson (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Johnson has two rushing attempts while seeing offensive snaps in just two games this season. His lack of involvement leaves him with minimal fantasy value. </div> <h3 id="-dj-moore-wr">🟢 DJ Moore (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Moore went from still being in a DC-area hospital Tuesday morning following the Bears' Week 6 win over the Commanders to pacing Chicago in receiving yards and sharing the team lead in receptions Sunday. Moore didn't look any worse for wear after suffering a groin injury versus Washington, and he's now cleared 40 receiving yards in consecutive games for the second time this season. The Bears' passing attack remains a relatively low-volume one most weeks, but Moore will remain an important target for Caleb Williams in a Week 8 road matchup against the Ravens next Sunday afternoon. </div> <h3 id="-tee-higgins-wr">🟢 Tee Higgins (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Higgins was outshined by fellow wideout Ja'Marr Chase, who finished with a surreal 16-161-1 line on 23 targets. However, under normal circumstances, Higgins' night would be considered a rousing success, as the veteran receiver put together season highs in all three components of his stat line. Higgins has encouragingly logged a combined 18 targets over his first two games working with Joe Flacco, and the duo will now have some extra practice time to continue building chemistry ahead of a Week 8 home matchup against the Jets on Sunday, Oct. 26. </div> <h3 id="-joe-flacco-qb">🟢 Joe Flacco (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Flacco had an abbreviated practice schedule for the second time in as many weeks since joining the Bengals, but the truncated preparation time clearly didn't affect the veteran signal-caller. As his final line implies, Flacco was crisp throughout the night and displayed elite chemistry with Ja'Marr Chase, who he smartly trained the bulk of his attention on. The duo combined for 16 completions, 161 yards and a touchdown, and Flacco also connected with Tee Higgins (29 yards) and Noah Fant (five yards) for his other pair of scores. Flacco now has a 5:0 TD:INT through his first pair of games in a Cincinnati uniform, and he'll finally have some extra time to settle in with the playbook ahead of a Week 8 home clash against the Jets on Sunday, Oct. 26. </div> <h3 id="-jerome-ford-rb">🟢 Jerome Ford (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Ford was given his fewest snaps (13) and second-fewest touches of the season, seeing less touch volume than Dylan Sampson (nine snaps, four touches), who also returned two kickoffs while Ford did not. That usage on special teams may be telling. It's a change that began in Week 6, when Sampson returned five kickoffs to Ford's one as the rookie takes over the top backup job behind starter Quinshon Judkins. With two more weeks before the trade deadline, Ford could be on the move before Nov. 4. </div> <h3 id="-christian-kirk-wr">🟡 Christian Kirk (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable </div> <h3 id="-cj-stroud-qb">🟢 C.J. Stroud (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Fresh off of a season-high, four-touchdown performance against the Ravens, Stroud reverted to inconsistent pocket play in a deflating loss to the Seahawks. The 23-year-old failed to complete 50 percent of his passes while finishing as many touchdown drives as the dominant defense playing behind him. Stroud didn't get much help from his ground game, actually finishing Monday's loss as the Texans' leading rusher ahead of Woody Marks (10-15-0) and Nick Chubb (5-16-0). He also lost top wideout Nico Collins early in the fourth quarter to a concussion, a situation worth monitoring ahead of next Sunday's tilt against the 49ers. Stroud's stock would suffer further in Week 8 if Collins is unable to clear the league's concussion protocol. </div> <h3 id="-jj-mccarthy-qb">🔴 J.J. McCarthy (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable </div> <h3 id="-juwan-johnson-te">🟢 Juwan Johnson (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The veteran tight end tied Chris Olave for the team lead in receptions while checking in as the runner-up to him in receiving yards. Johnson's yardage total was a new season high and his best since Week 18 of last season, while his target tally was just two fewer than the combined number of looks he'd seen in the previous three games. Sunday's level of involvement was particularly encouraging considering the availability of both Taysom Hill and Foster Moreau, and Johnson should continue to be a focal point of the offense in a Week 8 home matchup against a Buccaneers defense that's notoriously generous to tight ends. </div> <h3 id="-breece-hall-rb">🟢 Breece Hall (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Jets had an abysmal offensive showing, mustering only 220 net yards on 60 plays. Hall was a part of that, though he had very little running room as the offense offered minimal threat through the passing game. His longest gain from scrimmage was only eight yards, and Hall has now been held below 60 total yards in four of seven games this season. Given that he's also yet to find the end zone, his fantasy output has been very volatile. </div> <h3 id="-dallas-goedert-te">🟢 Dallas Goedert (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Goedert was a distant third in receiving yards and saw only half the targets of the runner-up in that category, A.J. Brown. The veteran tight end has taken a more prominent role in the offense on certain weeks so far this season -- especially Week 6 against the Giants (9-110-1) -- but Goedert still is a clear third cog behind DeVonta Smith and Brown and has 37 receiving yards or fewer in four of the last five games. Goedert gets another crack at the G-Men in a Week 8 home matchup next Sunday afternoon. </div> <h3 id="-kendrick-bourne-wr">🟢 Kendrick Bourne (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Bourne failed to extend his unlikely streak of recording exactly 142 yards to three games in Sunday's win. The drop-off was drastic for the veteran wideout after finishing with a season-low two targets. The victory was led by San Francisco's defense and rushing attack, resulting in poor receiving lines for every position player outside of RB Christian McCaffrey (7-72-0). Bourne's role could reduce further in Week 8 if Ricky Pearsall (knee) is able to return from injury. For now, consider Bourne a deep-league option against the Texans next Sunday. </div> <h3 id="-zach-charbonnet-rb">🟢 Zach Charbonnet (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Charbonnet was the money-maker out of Seattle's talented backfield duo Monday, cashing in both of his team's rushing touchdowns on the evening. Kenneth Walker (17-66-0) received five more carries and was the game's leading rusher, but it is obvious which stat line fantasy GMs prefer in Week 7. Charbonnet's nose for the end zone (five touchdowns in six active games) has helped mask a career-worst mark of 2.8 YPC. The skilled backup should continue generating flex value when the Seahawks come out of a Week 8 bye to face the Commanders on Nov. 2. </div> <h3 id="-kenneth-walker-iii-rb">🟢 Kenneth Walker III (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Walked finished as the Seahawks' leading rusher with a team-high 17 carries on Monday Night Football. The veteran starter's fantasy managers will still feel jealous of teammate Zach Charbonnet's 12-49-2 rushing line after the latter cashed in a pair of goal-line carries. Walker is still providing more volume out of Seattle's backfield through seven weeks, generating 430 rushing yards off of a career-best 4.7 YPC with three trips to the end zone himself. Both talented rushers will be worth starting in fantasy when the Seahawks return from the upcoming bye week to face the Commanders on Nov. 2. </div> <h3 id="-terry-mclaurin-wr">🟡 Terry McLaurin (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable </div> <h3 id="-chris-moore-wr">🟢 Chris Moore (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Moore continued filling in for injured starters after popping up with a 3-46-1 receiving line against the Bears in Week 6. Jaylin Lane (3-60-0) finished as Washington's leading receiver in an otherwise forgettable overall performance against a division rival. Moore could be find himself in another elevated role against the Chiefs if Terry McLaurin (quadriceps) and Deebo Samuel (knee) remain sidelined next Monday. </div> <hr/> <h2 id="-lineup-analysis">📝 Lineup Analysis</h2> <h3 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h3> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_7_2025_BTE_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <h3 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h3> <p><small><em>What you should have started for maximum points</em></small></p> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_7_2025_BTE_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <hr/> <h2 id="-week-8-optimal-projected-lineup">🔮 Week 8 Optimal Projected Lineup</h2> <div style="padding: 15px;

</code></pre> <hr/> <h2 id="-player-report">🏥 Player Report</h2> <h3 id="-drake-london-wr">🟢 Drake London (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> London logged double-digit targets for the fourth time in six games this season, so lack of opportunity wasn't the reason for his poor line. However, he struggled to connect with Michael Penix both deep and in short areas of the field, leading to his inefficient day and his lowest yardage total of the campaign. The Falcons' passing game appeared to be getting on track in Weeks 5 and 6, making this a particularly disappointing step back. </div> <h3 id="-justice-hill-rb">🟢 Justice Hill (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Ravens ran a run-heavy offense as long as possible, giving Hill a chance to mix in on possessions to relieve Derrick Henry. Hill saw a season-high six carries as a result, but he made a more significant impact as a pass catcher. His usage could change with the anticipated return of Lamar Jackson (hamstring) after the team's bye, but Hill has at least three catches in four of six games on the campaign. </div> <h3 id="-joshua-palmer-wr">🟡 Joshua Palmer (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Palmer was forced out of the first half of Monday's 24-14 loss to the Falcons with an ankle injury, finishing the night with two receptions for 60 yards. Though Palmer may have been hard-pressed to make it back to the field if the Bills played on Sunday this week, he'll benefit from Buffalo being on bye for Week 7. The wideout will still need to resume practicing in some fashion during Week 8 to have a chance at playing in the Bills' next game Oct. 26 versus the Panthers. </div> <h3 id="-courtland-sutton-wr">🟢 Courtland Sutton (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Sutton got back on track after being held to just 17 receiving yards against the Jets in London last week. The 29-year-old helped play the role of hero when he corralled a 22-yard pass from QB Bo Nix on the penultimate play before a game-winning field goal from kicker Wil Lutz. Sutton has been providing WR2 production for fantasy managers with a 33-469-3 receiving line through seven weeks. Consider the physical wideout a plus play for next Sunday's tilt against a porous Dallas pass defense. </div> <h3 id="-trevor-lawrence-qb">🟢 Trevor Lawrence (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Jaguars were staring at a 21-0 deficit at halftime, so Lawrence was forced to put the ball in the air most of the second half. The volume led to a season high in passing yards for the fifth-year QB, as well as Travis Hunter's first career TD reception, but it also led to Lawrence being sacked seven times. He'll take a mediocre 9:5 TD:INT through seven games into Jacksonville's Week 8 bye. </div> <h3 id="-hollywood-brown-wr">🟢 Hollywood Brown (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Brown made an early impact in the game, hauling in an eight-yard touchdown to put the Chiefs up 14-0. He was a non-factor after that, mixing in for similar target volume with all of the Chiefs' pass catchers except Rashee Rice. Brown could pop up for decent performances throughout the rest of the season, but the return of Rice will make it difficult for Brown to retain the consistent involvement in the offense he enjoyed in the early part of the campaign. </div> <h3 id="-jakobi-meyers-wr">🟢 Jakobi Meyers (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Out<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Meyers missed his first game of the season during Las Vegas' blowout 31-0 loss to the Chiefs in Week 7 while Bowers hasn't played since Week 4, but the Raiders anticipate having both pass catchers back in the lineup versus Jacksonville on Sunday, Nov. 2 in Week 9. Trade rumors have also surrounded Meyers in recent weeks, and back in late August he in fact requested to be dealt elsewhere by Las Vegas. The team's midseason respite could provide a space for the Raiders to explore options on that front prior to the NFL's trade deadline on Tuesday, Nov. 4, but as long as he remains on the roster, Meyers projects to resume handling his usual starting role moving forward. </div> <h3 id="-rashid-shaheed-wr">🟢 Rashid Shaheed (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Shaheed was the surprise leader in targets on the afternoon for New Orleans while curiously posting four catches for the sixth consecutive game. The speedy fourth-year pro has just two catches of more than 20 yards this season after compiling five in just six 2024 games before his campaign was cut short. The way Spencer Rattler is being asked to manage the offense certainly has something to do with that downturn, but Shaheed should remain a steady contributor in a Week 8 home matchup against the Buccaneers next Sunday afternoon. </div> <h3 id="-saquon-barkley-rb">🟢 Saquon Barkley (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> In addition to being stymied on the ground yet again, Barkley also suffered an injury scare when he exited the game briefly in the second half to be evaluated for a concussion. Barkley eventually returned to the contest, but he finished with under 60 rushing yards for the fifth straight game. Barkley had a long run of just nine yards as well, and the inefficient afternoon was especially disappointing considering he quickly netted 16 yards on his first three carries during the Eagles' opening drive. The 2018 first-round pick will look for a resurgent outing at the expense of his former Giants squad in a Week 8 divisional clash next Sunday afternoon. </div> <h3 id="-brock-purdy-qb">🟡 Brock Purdy (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable </div> <h3 id="-george-kittle-te">🔴 George Kittle (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> It was a Christian McCaffrey focused gameplan out of the gates Sunday, resulting in no San Francisco receiver topping 31 yards in the win. Kittle's managers were hoping for more after he spent the last five-plus weeks tending to his injured hamstring on IR. The star tight end didn't appear limited while running routes, which is the only silver lining from Sunday's bagel in the box score. Kittle will look to get more involved offensively against the Texans next Sunday for a 49ers squad that is still banged-up at the receiver position. </div> <h3 id="-tony-pollard-rb">🟢 Tony Pollard (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Pollard slipped into an even workload with Tyjae Spears on the ground, though the Titans attempted only 12 rushes as a team. Instead, Pollard earned most of his fantasy value as a pass catcher, with six catches marking his highest total since Week 14 of the 2023 campaign. While it was a positive for Week 7, the likelihood of Pollard repeating this performance in the passing game consistently moving forward is slim. Given the state of the Titans' offense and the split in workload, Pollard has lost much of his fantasy appeal since Spears has returned. </div> <h3 id="-zach-ertz-te">🟢 Zach Ertz (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Ertz was one of the few bright spots on either side of the ball for the Commanders in the blowout loss. The veteran starter cashed in his second touchdown in as many weeks, bringing his season receiving line up to 23-229-4 in seven appearances. Ertz showed no limitations from the shoulder injury that plagued him during the practice week, setting him up for another start against the Chiefs on Monday Night Football in Week 8. </div> <hr/> <h2 id="-lineup-analysis">📝 Lineup Analysis</h2> <h3 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h3> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_7_2025_EET_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <h3 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h3> <p><small><em>What you should have started for maximum points</em></small></p> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_7_2025_EET_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <hr/> <h2 id="-week-8-optimal-projected-lineup">🔮 Week 8 Optimal Projected Lineup</h2> <div style="padding: 15px; background-color: #e7f3ff; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;"> <strong>Next Opponent:</strong> Mama Daughter Duo<br/> <strong>Total Projected Points:</strong> 95.57<br/> </div> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_8_2025_EET_projected.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> <th data-field="opponent" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="false">Opponent</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <hr/> <h2 id="-remaining-schedule-analysis">📅 Remaining Schedule Analysis</h2> <div style="padding: 15px; background-color: #fff3cd; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;"> <strong>⚠️ Average Opponent Strength:</strong> 115.54 PPG </div> <table class="table table-sm table-hover"> <thead><tr> <th>Opponent</th><th>Record</th><th>Avg Points</th> </tr></thead> <tbody> <tr><td><strong>Mama Daughter Duo</strong></td><td>3-4</td><td>135.33</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>Americas Team</strong></td><td>4-3</td><td>137.28</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>Big Titi Energy</strong></td><td>1-6</td><td>92.29</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>To Infinity and Bijan!</strong></td><td>3-4</td><td>107.78</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>Abbey's TNT Team</strong></td><td>5-2</td><td>121.63</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>Mcconky Donkeys</strong></td><td>4-3</td><td>106.65</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>To Infinity and Bijan!</strong></td><td>3-4</td><td>107.78</td></tr> </tbody></table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week7"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Week 7 League Recap</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-7_Recap/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Week 7 League Recap"/><published>2025-10-21T13:03:07+00:00</published><updated>2025-10-21T13:03:07+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-7_Recap</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-7_Recap/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="-week-at-a-glance">📊 Week at a Glance</h2> <h3 id="matchup-results">Matchup Results</h3> <p><strong>Michael’s Managable Team</strong> 187.93 -

While Murray has missed the last two contests due to a mid-foot sprain, Jacoby Brissett has directed the offense during that stretch, completing 52 of 80 passes for 599 yards, four touchdowns and one interception, rushing nine times for 45 yards and losing his only fumble. Murray himself hasn't surpassed 220 passing yards in any of his five starts and has combined for a 6:3 TD:INT so far this season. </div> <h3 id="-darnell-mooney-wr">🟢 Darnell Mooney (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Mooney managed to suit up for the first time since Week 4 and was third in priority for targets behind Drake London and Kyle Pitts. He was used primarily as a deep target, and he delivered a 38-yard catch just before halftime to push the Falcons into field-goal range. Mooney is likely to see inconsistent targets and serves in a boom-or-bust role, both of which make him a risky fantasy contributor moving forward. </div> <h3 id="-kyle-pitts-sr-te">🟢 Kyle Pitts Sr. (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Pitts commanded double-digit targets for the third time in his career and for the first time since Week 5 of the 2023 season. Several of his targets came in the short areas of the field, leading to a modest yardage total, though he did manage long gains of 19 and 17 yards while also having a 27-yard catch nullified by a holding call early in the first quarter. While the volume of targets suggests this could have been a bigger game, Pitts has at least five catches in half of his six games this season and has topped 60 receiving yards in two of the last three contests. </div> <h3 id="-mark-andrews-te">🟢 Mark Andrews (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The positive for Andrews was that he remained involved in the Baltimore offense, finishing tied for second on the team in targets. He was unable to convert that into much production while catching passes from the combination of Cooper Rush and Tyler Huntley, with his longest gain going for only nine yards. The outlook for all Ravens pass catchers should improve with the anticipated return of Lamar Jackson (hamstring) in Week 8 following the team's bye, though Andrews could lose out on opportunity to more explosive options such as Rashod Bateman and Isaiah Likely. </div> <h3 id="-keon-coleman-wr">🟢 Keon Coleman (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Coleman tied for the team lead in receptions and targets, but as his final line indicates, those opportunities were essentially for naught. The second-year wideout has endured an underwhelming season that's included a Week 5 benching for that game's opening series, and Coleman notably couldn't make an impact Monday despite the Bills being without Dalton Kincaid (oblique) and Curtis Samuel (neck/ribs) to begin the game and then losing Joshua Palmer (ankle) during the contest. Coleman and quarterback Josh Allen will have a Week 7 bye to work on their chemistry before returning to action Oct. 26 on the road against the Panthers. </div> <h3 id="-tetairoa-mcmillan-wr">🟢 Tetairoa McMillan (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> McMillan got the attention of Sauce Gardner (concussion) for most of the game, which led to limited opportunity and production. Ultimately, he was held to five targets and three receptions for the second consecutive game, combining to record only 62 yards in that span. Things could open a bit for McMillan in Week 8 against Buffalo, as the Panthers will almost certainly have to have an effective passing attack to have hope of keeping pace in the contest. </div> <h3 id="-javonte-williams-rb">🟢 Javonte Williams (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Williams got back on track following last week's dud against Carolina (13-29-0) with his second 100-plus yard rushing game of the year. The 25-year-old kicked off the scoring with a short touchdown scamper on the Cowboys' opening drive, then proceeded to eat chunks of yardage throughout the contest. Williams is experiencing a true breakout fantasy campaign with a stellar 111-592-6 rushing line off of a career-best 5.3 YPC through seven starts in 2025. The 2021 second-round pick will get a chance to flex his newfound success against the team that drafted him when the Cowboys visit the Broncos next Sunday. </div> <h3 id="-marvin-mims-jr-wr">🟢 Marvin Mims Jr. (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Mims checked in as the Broncos' second-leading receiver in Sunday's comeback victory, finishing only behind Courtland Sutton's 6-87-0 receiving line. The 23-year-old Mims added 13 yards on his fourth rushing attempt of the season to finish as Denver's highest yardage producer. That said, Mims finished with two or fewer receptions in four out of his last five appearances, highlighting the playmaker's weekly volatility. Fantasy managers are hoping for one of Mims' "boom" games in a soft matchup against the Cowboys next Sunday. </div> <h3 id="-josh-jacobs-rb">🟢 Josh Jacobs (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Both TDs came in the second half as the Packers rallied from a 13-6 halftime deficit, with Jacobs hitting paydirt from seven yards out in the third quarter and from the one-yard line in the fourth for the game-winning score. It's the veteran back's third straight game with multiple touchdowns, and while he has yet to reach 100 rushing yards in a game in 2025, Jacobs' eight TDs on the ground and 593 scrimmage yards through six contests have given him plenty of fantasy value. He'll look to keep rolling in Week 8 against the Steelers. </div> <h3 id="-nick-chubb-rb">🟢 Nick Chubb (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Head coach DeMeco Ryans proclaimed that he wanted to establish the run against the Seahawks, but he proceeded to give his veteran starter five carries in a game that was never quite out of reach. Chubb didn't do himself any favors, averaging a season-worst 3.2 yards per carry in the loss. Rookie Woody Marks (10-15-0) didn't fare much better on the ground, but he did catch C.J. Stroud's lone touchdown pass of the evening. Chubb had been providing a high floor for those in deeper formats prior to Sunday's dud, so it could be worth giving him another shot against San Francisco's injury-riddled defense Sunday. </div> <h3 id="-quentin-johnston-wr">🟢 Quentin Johnston (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Making his return from a one-game absence due to a hamstring strain, Johnston struggled with drops and didn't see a lot of volume, but he was still able to make an impact with a seven-yard TD reception from Justin Herbert in the third quarter. Johnston will take a 28-407-5 line on 46 targets through six contests into a Week 8 meeting with the Vikings, who just surrendered a combined 13-304-3 line to A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith. </div> <h3 id="-carson-wentz-qb">🟡 Carson Wentz (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Wentz initially injured his left non-throwing shoulder Week 5 against the Browns in London but was able to suit up Sunday against the Eagles following a Week 6 bye. Overall, he completed 26 of 42 passes for 313 yards, no touchdowns and two interceptions, tallied four carries for 28 yards and didn't lose his only fumble. Wentz is averaging 268 passing yards per game and has a 5:4 TD:INT in his four-game starting stint in place of second-year signal-caller J.J. McCarthy, who remains in recovery mode from the high right-ankle sprain that he suffered Week 2. McCarthy also was listed as limited Monday, but Wentz appears poised to lead Minnesota's offense again Thursday at the Chargers, something that likely will be announced in advance of that contest. </div> <h3 id="-justin-jefferson-wr">🟢 Justin Jefferson (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Jefferson posted a team-high 40-yard reception during the close contest, but he ultimately played second fiddle to Jordan Addison, who finished with a 9-128-0 line on 12 targets, all team-high figures. Nevertheless, Jefferson's day wasn't a total washout by any stretch, and he extended his streak of 75-plus-yard tallies to five games while also getting to at least five receptions for the fourth consecutive contest. Jefferson hasn't found the end zone since Week 1 against the Bears, however, a matter he'll look to rectify Thursday night when the Vikings and Chargers open the Week 8 slate in Los Angeles. </div> <h3 id="-theo-johnson-te">🟢 Theo Johnson (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Johnson was the beneficiary of good fortune when he caught a tipped pass that was not intended for him for a 41-yard touchdown. It was the 24-year-old's fourth touchdown reception in as many weeks, providing a hot stretch of play for fantasy managers over that span. Johnson continues showing great rapport with rookie QB Jaxson Dart as the team prepares to face Philadelphia for the second time this season. </div> <h3 id="-justin-fields-qb">🟢 Justin Fields (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Fields has turned in back-to-back disastrous performances under center for New York, culminating in his being benched at halftime during the team's 12-6 loss to the Panthers in Week 6. Prior to being replaced by Taylor, Fields completed six of 12 passes for just 46 yards, with no touchdowns or interceptions, adding 22 yards on four carries. While part of Fields' struggles versus Carolina can be attributed to Garrett Wilson (knee) being inactive, he had been even worse Week 6 versus Denver in London, a loss in which he completed just nine of 17 pass attempts for 45 yards with zero touchdowns or interceptions while getting sacked an incredible nine times. The Jets will continue to evaluate the quarterback position before announcing a Week 8 starter, but at this stage, even with his rushing upside, Fields will be difficult to trust for fantasy purposes if he remains in the lineup. </div> <h3 id="-chris-godwin-jr-wr">🔴 Chris Godwin Jr. (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable </div> <h3 id="-jaylin-lane-wr">🟢 Jaylin Lane (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Lane finished as the Commanders' leading receiver in a game that Washington's top three receivers were forced to miss. The fourth-round rookie responded well by recording his best receiving line through seven pro appearances. With an extra day of rest between before next Monday's tilt against Kansas City, Lane could see his role reduced based on how many starters (if any) are able to return in Week 8. </div> <hr/> <h2 id="-lineup-analysis">📝 Lineup Analysis</h2> <h3 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h3> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_7_2025_TIB_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <h3 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h3> <p><small><em>What you should have started for maximum points</em></small></p> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_7_2025_TIB_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <hr/> <h2 id="-week-8-optimal-projected-lineup">🔮 Week 8 Optimal Projected Lineup</h2> <div style="padding: 15px;

The Cardinals get a Week 8 bye, but Knight will have at least one more game in a prominent backfield role in Week 9 against the Cowboys, with Trey Benson (knee) required to miss one more game before being eligible to come off IR. Over the three games Benson has missed so far, Knight has collected 142 scrimmage yards and two rushing TDs. </div> <h3 id="-marvin-harrison-jr-wr">🟢 Marvin Harrison Jr. (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Harrison came out of a Week 6 loss in Indianapolis with a concussion that limited him at Wednesday's walkthrough and Thursday's practice, but his ability to handle every practice rep Friday followed by avoiding a Week 7 designation indicates he's been cleared by an independent neurologist. QB Kyler Murray (foot) is listed as questionable for Sunday's contest after being listed as limited all week, but Jacoby Brissett took all the visible reps with the first-team offense, suggesting the latter is more likely than the former to be tossing passes Harrison's way this weekend. </div> <h3 id="-dalton-kincaid-te">🟡 Dalton Kincaid (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable </div> <h3 id="-james-cook-iii-rb">🟢 James Cook III (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Cook enjoyed a solid night on the ground despite game script working against the run as the game unfolded, bouncing back nicely from a 49-yard showing in the Week 5 loss to the Patriots. However, he failed to draw a target for the first time this season after not hauling in the one pass thrown his way Week 5, a relatively rare slump for him as a pass catcher. Cook's fantasy value remains significantly elevated in all formats, however, and he draws a favorable matchup on the road against the Panthers on Sunday, Oct. 26 following Buffalo's Week 7 bye. </div> <h3 id="-jk-dobbins-rb">🟢 J.K. Dobbins (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Dobbins responded well from his worst outing of the season against the Jets last week (14-40-0), averaging 5.8 yards a carry while leading his team in rushing against the Giants. The veteran starter was held out of the end zone in consecutive games for the first time this season, which is the only negative takeaway from Sunday's win. Backup RJ Harvey poached a receiving touchdown on his only reception, but he generated zero rushing yards on four attempts as the Broncos backfield continues to belong to Dobbins. The Ohio State product checks in as a safe starting option in fantasy for Week 8 in a soft matchup against the Cowboys next Sunday. </div> <h3 id="-jared-goff-qb">🟢 Jared Goff (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Goff was able to lead his team to victory on Monday Night Football, but it came at the expense of his first multi-turnover game of the season. It also was the veteran signal-caller's third time scoring one touchdown or less this year. Goff has thrown 12 touchdowns to just one interception in his four other starts, so his whole body of work has been positive as Detroit enters its Week 8 bye. The 30-year-old should continue to be treated as a starting-level option in fantasy when the Lions host the Vikings on Sunday, Nov. 2. </div> <h3 id="-romeo-doubs-wr">🟢 Romeo Doubs (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> While Tucker Kraft led the Packers with 10 targets and was on the other end of Jordan Love's only TD pass, it was Doubs who paced the team in catches and receiving yards. The fourth-year wideout has caught at least five passes in three straight games as he shines in the absence of Jayden Reed (collarbone), posting a 17-185-3 line on 25 targets during that stretch. Doubs will look to keep rolling in Week 8 against the Steelers. </div> <h3 id="-matthew-golden-wr">🟢 Matthew Golden (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Packers' offense didn't really wake up until the second half, and Golden wasn't able to do as much with his limited volume as he had in Week 6 against the Bengals. The rookie wideout has yet to see more than six targets in a game in the pros, and he's still looking for his first TD in the NFL. Golden will take a modest 18-249-0 line on 23 targets through six contests into a Week 8 meeting with the Steelers. </div> <h3 id="-tyler-warren-te">🟢 Tyler Warren (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The rookie tight end saw modest target volume, but he finished second in receiving yards on the Colts behind Alec Pierce and hit paydirt for a fourth straight week (the first one being a rushing touchdown) when he connected with Daniel Jones for a five-yard score in the second quarter. Warren has quickly become a key part of a dominant offense, posting a 33-439-3 line on 45 targets through his first seven NFL games. He'll look to make another visit to the end zone in Week 8 against a Titans defense that held him to a 3-38-0 line in their first meeting back in Week 3. </div> <h3 id="-travis-hunter-wr">🟢 Travis Hunter (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The rookie two-way player hauled in his first career touchdown on a 34-yard toss from Trevor Lawrence with 9:06 remaining in the fourth quarter. Hunter set new personal bests in catches, yards and targets in the performance, and his volume increase came as Brian Thomas (shoulder) and Dyami Brown (leg) checked in and out of the lineup in the second half. The Jaguars will be on bye in Week 8, but if Thomas' injury proves to be serious, Hunter could be headed for significantly elevated volume in the second half. </div> <h3 id="-ashton-jeanty-rb">🟢 Ashton Jeanty (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Raiders had arguably the worst offensive showing by a team this season, running only 30 offensive plays for 95 net yards. That didn't offer Jeanty any opportunity to get going, though he did still account for one of the team's more explosive plays with a 13-yard catch and run late in the third quarter. It was a disappointing time for Jeanty to turn in the lowest yardage total of his career, as he had topped 100 yards from scrimmage in two of his last three contests. </div> <h3 id="-kayshon-boutte-wr">🟢 Kayshon Boutte (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Boutte saw only two targets, his lowest total since Week 2. However, he still managed to turn in a productive effort thanks primarily to a 39-yard touchdown just before halftime to give the Patriots a lead they wouldn't concede. Boutte has now found the end zone in consecutive games, also logging his second- and third-best yardage totals of the season in those contests. </div> <h3 id="-jaxson-dart-qb">🟢 Jaxson Dart (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> It was a crushing loss for the Giants, considering Dart pushed his fourth touchdown of the contest across the goal line with 40 seconds left in regulation, only to watch a missed extra-point attempt open the door for the Broncos to come back and win it with a field goal as time expired. The rookie signal-caller finished with his worst completion percentage (45.5) as a pro, but he offset the inefficiency with new highs in passing yards (283) and total touchdowns (four). Dart's fourth and final trip to the end zone came as a rusher, which helped offset a season-low five rush attempts Sunday. The Ole Miss product will attempt to overcome another tough defensive matchup when the Giants visit the Eagles next Sunday. Dart generated 23.6 standard fantasy points when these two teams met in New York back in Week 6. </div> <h3 id="-jake-tonges-te">🟢 Jake Tonges (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> George Kittle (hamstring) was activated from injured reserve for Sunday's contest, which pushed Tonges back down to third on the tight end depth chart. Luke Farrell (33 percent) finished second in playing time behind Kittle (81 percent), as it appears that the coaching staff prefers the former's blocking in the No. 2 role over Tonges' play-making ability. Tonges did an admirable job filling in for Kittle, producing a 25-224-3 receiving line in five-plus games played. Fantasy managers can safely move on from Tonges in Week 8, but he is a name to remember for any games Kittle might miss in the future. </div> <h3 id="-mac-jones-qb">🟢 Mac Jones (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Jones was asked to play the role of game manager Sunday, and he did just that, keeping drives alive for Christian McCaffrey to feast on Atlanta's defense for 200-plus yards and two touchdowns. The veteran backup threw an interception for the second week in a row and failed to record a touchdown in as many games. Jones has been a godsend for the 5-2 49ers, but the luster has worn off from a fantasy perspective following a hot start filling in for Brock Purdy (toe). The latter resumed practicing this week, so it wouldn't be shocking to see Jones resume his backup role against the Texans next Sunday. </div> <h3 id="-chig-okonkwo-te">🟢 Chig Okonkwo (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Okonkwo maintained his typical allotment of snaps, as he was on the field for 61 percent of offensive plays. However, his role as a pass catcher was diminished relative to Gunnar Helm, who was the far superior receiver in the loss. Okonkwo has at least four catches in four of seven games this season, so this performance was likely an anamoly. </div> <hr/> <h2 id="-lineup-analysis">📝 Lineup Analysis</h2> <h3 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h3> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_7_2025_TOM_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <h3 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h3> <p><small><em>What you should have started for maximum points</em></small></p> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_7_2025_TOM_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <hr/> <h2 id="-week-8-optimal-projected-lineup">🔮 Week 8 Optimal Projected Lineup</h2> <div style="padding: 15px;

Quinshon Judkins, who scored three rushing touchdowns, and the Browns defense, which picked off Tua Tagovailoa three times and also recorded a pair of sacks, did most of the heavy lifting, leading to Gabriel's lowest passing yardage total yet in three games as a starter. The 2025 third-round pick will face off with Drake Maye and the Patriots on the road in Week 8 next Sunday afternoon. </div> <h3 id="-quinshon-judkins-rb">🟢 Quinshon Judkins (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> As expected, Judkins handled significant volume on the ground against what had been a vulnerable Dolphins run defense, but he was just one run away from actually disappointing profoundly from an efficiency basis. The rookie back's season-long 46-yard run, which went for a touchdown early in the second quarter, was the first of a career-high three scores for Judkins and helped obscure the fact he netted a scant 38 yards on his other 24 carries. Nevertheless, the three trips to the end zone pushed Judkins' TD total to five in just six games, and he'll look for per-carry success in a Week 8 road matchup against the Patriots. </div> <h3 id="-jameson-williams-wr">🟢 Jameson Williams (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The usually sure-handed Williams failed to haul in either of his targets on a low-volume passing night dominated by Detroit's run game. The 24-year-old has been a hit-or-miss fantasy asset through seven weeks, doing most of his damage in two big-scoring games. Williams couldn't improve on his 17-289-2 receiving line Monday as the Lions prepare to enter a bye week. The Alabama product should continue to be treated as a risky high-upside play against the Vikings in Week 9. </div> <h3 id="-nico-collins-wr">🟡 Nico Collins (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Collins hit his head hard on the turf on a contested catch attempt early in the fourth quarter. He was evaluated in the medical tent before walking to the locker room for further evaluation. Collins now will face a short week to pass the league's protocols ahead of a Week 8 matchup against San Francisco. </div> <h3 id="-jonathan-taylor-rb">🟢 Jonathan Taylor (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Colts offense just keeps on rolling, and Taylor has been its engine, scoring from 23 yards out in the first quarter Sunday before dashing for eight and 19-yard scores in the third. It's the third time in seven games this season that Taylor has gotten into the end zone three times, en route to an NFL-best 11 TDs in total (10 rushing, one receiving) and 882 yards from scrimmage. He seems unlikely to be slowed down in Week 8 by the Titans. </div> <h3 id="-brock-bowers-te">🟢 Brock Bowers (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Out<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Bowers hasn't played since Week 4 due to a lingering PCL injury and bone bruise, but the star tight end is expected to be back in the lineup Week 9 versus the Jaguars on Sunday, Nov. 2. Carroll said the same of wide receiver Jakobi Meyers (knee/toe), who joined Bowers on the sideline during the team's blowout 31-0 loss to Kansas City in Week 7. Bowers surpassed 100 receiving yards Week 1 but then logged three consecutive games below the 50-yard mark and without a touchdown while playing through his knee injury, so fantasy managers will hope he's able to return to both full health and his usual productivity levels when back in the lineup. </div> <h3 id="-kimani-vidal-rb">🟢 Kimani Vidal (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> After a huge Week 6 performance against the Dolphins as the Chargers' lead back, Vidal had much less success in Week 7. While he still led Los Angeles in carries, Justin Herbert actually led the team in rushing yards with a meager 31. With Omarion Hampton (IR, ankle) likely still more than a month away from his return, Vidal will maintain his spot at the top of the depth chart heading into a Week 8 clash with a Vikings defense that just held Saquon Barkley to 44 rushing yards and 2.4 yards per carry. </div> <h3 id="-tua-tagovailoa-qb">🟢 Tua Tagovailoa (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Tagovailoa was benched late in the fourth quarter of Miami's 31-6 loss to the Browns in Week 7, a matchup that saw the fifth-year pro succumb to adverse weather conditions and throw three interceptions with zero touchdowns and only 130 passing yards. He had previously also thrown three interceptions in the Dolphins' loss to the Chargers in Week 6. Rookie seventh-round pick Quinn Ewers didn't fare much better than Tagovailoa, as he nearly threw an INT on his first snap, fumbled two plays later and ended the game with five completions for 53 yards on eight pass attempts. Now sitting at a 1-6 record, McDaniel and Tagovialoa may both be at risk of losing their positions if the team can't right the ship against the Falcons, a task that will be all the more difficult with tight end Darren Waller (pectoral) looking unlikely to be available. </div> <h3 id="-jaylen-waddle-wr">🟢 Jaylen Waddle (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Tua Tagovailoa threw for just 100 yards while barely completing more than 50.0 percent of his passes before giving way to Quinn Ewers in garbage time, so Waddle's line is slightly less alarming within that context. Nevertheless, the veteran receiver's numbers were season lows across the board, and his catch total was also a new career-worst mark. The Dolphins offense had its worst day of the season overall Sunday, and even though Waddle could bounce back to an extent in a Week 8 road matchup against the Falcons, meaningful production will remain hard to come by if Tagovailoa continues to struggle with ball security and efficiency. </div> <h3 id="-jordan-mason-rb">🟢 Jordan Mason (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Mason saw opportunities limited somewhat by game script at certain points, but the offseason addition put together a serviceable performance that he rounded out with his fourth rushing touchdown of the season via a one-yard run late in the third quarter. He has topped out at Sunday's rushing yardage total in the last three games following a 116-yard, two-touchdown tally versus the Bengals in Week 3, but he should remain the lead back in a Week 8 road matchup against the Chargers on Thursday night as long as Aaron Jones (hamstring) remains on injured reserve. </div> <h3 id="-jordan-addison-wr">🟢 Jordan Addison (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Addison led the Vikings across the board in receptions, receiving yards and targets with figures that also all qualified as season highs. The third-year pro's longest catch went for 34 yards, so he consistently was able to record significant gains during the high-scoring, back-and-forth affair. Addison has displayed excellent chemistry with fill-in quarterback Carson Wentz after the wide receiver's suspension-delayed start to the season, and he's likely to continue working with him in a Thursday night Week 8 road matchup against the Chargers since J.J. McCarthy (ankle) is unlikely to be ready to return with the short turnaround. </div> <h3 id="-garrett-wilson-wr">🟡 Garrett Wilson (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable </div> <h3 id="-jaylen-warren-rb">🟢 Jaylen Warren (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Warren came just two yards short of his single-game career high in rushing yards, which he set against the Browns back on Nov. 19, 2023. The versatile back was in outstanding form against a Bengals defense that had been particularly prone to allowing chunk plays on the ground, compiling a season-high yardage total with the help of four runs of 10+ yards and a co-game-long 37-yard scamper. Warren also has at least four catches in three of the last four contests, and Thursday's performance affords him plenty of momentum heading into a Week 8 home showdown against the Packers on Sunday night, Oct. 26. </div> <h3 id="-jauan-jennings-wr">🟢 Jauan Jennings (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Jennings was dealing with a myriad of minor injuries before being cleared of all designations leading up to Sunday's kick off. The 27-year-old operated as the 49ers' top wideout with Ricky Pearsall (knee) and Brandon Aiyuk (knee) still unavailable for Week 7. Jennings' 31 receiving yards and seven targets led all San Francisco receivers not named Christian McCaffrey, who carried the offense with 201 yards from scrimmage and two touchdowns. Look for Jennings' production to improve alongside his health as the season progresses. Up next is a road tilt against the Texans next Sunday. </div> <h3 id="-aj-barner-te">🟢 AJ Barner (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Barner finished in the relatively unfamiliar position of second in receiving yardage and tied with Jaxon Smith-Njigba for the longest reception of the game. That catch covered a distance of 61 yards on the first play of Seattle's game-clinching drive, with Barner getting loose down the middle of the field after making the reception and taking the ball down to the Jaguars' 12-yard line. Barner has now set new single-game season highs in receiving yards in three consecutive contests, but he's typically much more of a shorter-area target for Sam Darnold and will remain a complementary pass-catching option in a tough Week 7 home matchup against the Texans on Monday night, Oct. 20. </div> <h3 id="-tyjae-spears-rb">🟢 Tyjae Spears (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Titans attempted only 12 rushes in the game, with Spears splitting the workload almost exactly evenly with Tony Pollard. More surprising was that Pollard out-produced him as a pass catcher, a role that Spears had seemingly taken over since his return to the field. While he's added an element to the Tennessee offense, the unit is poor enough that Spears won't be able to sustain fantasy vlaue so long as he's in a split with Pollard. </div> <hr/> <h2 id="-lineup-analysis">📝 Lineup Analysis</h2> <h3 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h3> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_7_2025_90s_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <h3 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h3> <p><small><em>What you should have started for maximum points</em></small></p> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_7_2025_90s_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <hr/> <h2 id="-week-8-optimal-projected-lineup">🔮 Week 8 Optimal Projected Lineup</h2> <div style="padding: 15px;

The 2024 first overall pick averaged 6.6 yards per attempt and generally scuffled against a beatable Saints defense, posting his lowest passing yardage total of the campaign. Williams did connect on another three completions of 20-plus yards, and his 20 such passes on the season over six games are exactly half the tally he generated in that category across 17 regular-season games in 2024. Williams next faces off with an inconsistent Ravens defense on the road in a Week 8 matchup next Sunday afternoon. </div> <h3 id="-rome-odunze-wr">🟢 Rome Odunze (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Odunze's target tally led the Bears on the afternoon, and he also finished with the second-highest receiving yardage total on the team. The latter particularly speaks to what a quiet day it was for the passing attack overall, as Caleb Williams threw for only 172 yards. Odunze put together a productive three-game stretch between Weeks 2 and 4 where he posted 14 receptions for 259 yards and four touchdowns, but he's netted just a 4-63-0 line on 11 targets in the subsequent pair of contests. Odunze will next face an inconsistent Ravens defense on the road in a Week 8 matchup next Sunday afternoon. </div> <h3 id="-dandre-swift-rb">🟢 D’Andre Swift (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Swift's long run on the day went for a relatively modest 23 yards, underscoring the fact he was able to consistently grind out productive gains throughout the afternoon. The veteran back both eclipsed the 100-yard mark and set a new season high in rushing yards for the second time in six days and went in for his third rushing TD of the season on an 11-yard run with just over nine minutes remaining in the first half. Swift is unsurprisingly proving to be a key cog in head coach Ben Johnson's innovative offense, and he'll take aim at the Ravens' suspect run defense on the road in a Week 8 matchup next Sunday afternoon. </div> <h3 id="-travis-kelce-te">🟢 Travis Kelce (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Kelce looked to be in for a big game, as he made two catches for 51 yards on the Chiefs' first offensive possession, highlighted by a long reception of 44 yards. However, he essentially went silent from there, with the offense instead running through Rashee Rice and several other different pass catchers. Nevertheless, Kelce has over 50 receiving yards in three consecutive games. </div> <h3 id="-hunter-henry-te">🟢 Hunter Henry (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Henry finished second on the team in targets and managed his highest target total since Week 3. He was a reliable option for Drake Maye, helping the Patriots get out from their own goal line with a 12-yard catch early in the second quarter while also converting on third down with an eight-yard reception two quarters later. While he plays a key role in the team's offense, Henry has failed to reach 50 receiving yards in four straight contests. </div> <h3 id="-chris-olave-wr">🟢 Chris Olave (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Olave tied with Juwan Johnson for the team lead in receptions while also setting the pace in receiving yards on the afternoon. The 2022 first-round pick connected with Spencer Rattler for touchdown catches of 21 and 14 yards in the second and third quarter, respectively, and he added a game-long 57-yard reception earlier in the drive that he capped off with his first scoring grab. Olave has been Rattler's most trusted target by far over the first seven games of the season, and the star wideout will head into next Sunday's Week 8 home matchup against the Buccaneers with a robust 44-440-3 line on 71 targets. </div> <h3 id="-will-shipley-rb">🟢 Will Shipley (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Shipley was the second running back on the depth chart Sunday, seeing the field for eight offensive snaps compared to four for Tank Bigsby, with AJ Dillon a healthy scratch. Unless Saquon Barkley gets hurt, however, there won't be enough touches available for any other running back on the team to have fantasy relevance. </div> <h3 id="-devonta-smith-wr">🟢 DeVonta Smith (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Smith led the Eagles across the board in receptions, receiving yards and targets with totals that were also season-high figures for the talented receiver. The 2021 first-round pick's yardage tally was additionally a career high, and Smith got there with a big hand from his 79-yard touchdown reception in the second quarter, his second score of the season. Jalen Hurts has been much more active as a passer over the last three games, and Smith has been a beneficiary, posting a 21-346-1 line on 26 targets in that span. Smith next will take aim at the Giants' inconsistent defense in a Week 8 home matchup next Sunday afternoon. </div> <h3 id="-jalen-hurts-qb">🟢 Jalen Hurts (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Hurts took three sacks, but otherwise he had a near-flawless day that allowed him to finish with a perfect 158.3 passer rating. The reigning Super Bowl MVP had to get aggressive through the air for the third straight game, ultimately setting a new season high in passing yardage yet again after also doing so in Weeks 5 and 6. Hurts was clicking with both of his top receivers, as DeVonta Smith and A.J. Brown accounted for 13 of his completions, 304 of his yards and all three of his touchdown passes. In addition to his 37- and 26-yard scoring strikes to Brown, Hurts also hit the star wideout for a critical 45-yard gain up the left sideline on third down with just under two minutes remaining, a play that would go on to allow Philadelphia to run out the clock. Hurts also connected with Smith for a 79-yard touchdown, the game's longest play through the air, in the third quarter, and the talented signal-caller will head into a Week 8 home rematch with the Giants boasting an 11:1 TD:INT on the campaign. </div> <h3 id="-kaleb-johnson-rb">🟢 Kaleb Johnson (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Johnson recorded six carries in each of the Steelers' last two games, but he was held off the field Thursday night despite being active. Jaylen Warren was dominant in Thursday's loss, racking up 158 yards from scrimmage, while Kenneth Gainwell was on the field for 39 percent of Pittsburgh's offensive snaps, so work likely will continue to be hard to come by for Johnson as long as the team's top two running backs are healthy. </div> <h3 id="-dk-metcalf-wr">🟢 DK Metcalf (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> On a night when Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins mostly stole the headlines in conjunction with Joe Flacco, Metcalf was almost a forgotten man, even on his own team to an extent. While the star wideout's yardage total was second on the night for the Steelers, he wasn't on the receiving end of any of Aaron Rodgers' quartet of scoring tosses, which all went to tight ends. Nevertheless, Metcalf and Rodgers have already flashed plenty of strong chemistry early on in their working relationship, as evidenced by the 22-406-4 receiving line on 36 targets Metcalf will take into a Week 8 home matchup against the Packers on Sunday night, Oct. 26. </div> <h3 id="-christian-mccaffrey-rb">🟢 Christian McCaffrey (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The levee finally broke in terms of McCaffrey's ground game as he cracked the century mark in rushing for the first time this season. It was also the dual-threat superstar's first game with multiple trips to the end zone in 2025, bringing his rushing touchdown total on par with the three receiving scores he has provided fantasy managers so far. McCaffrey also served as the 49ers' leading receiver in a truly dominating performance from start to finish. CMC has been an absolute monster in fantasy this season with over 900 combined yards from scrimmage, making him virtually matchup-proof heading into next Sunday's tilt against a stingy Houston defense. </div> <h3 id="-rachaad-white-rb">🟢 Rachaad White (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> White drew another start for Bucky Irving (foot/shoulder) but partly fell victim to game script, as the Lions had jumped out to a 14-3 lead by halftime. White also tied for second in receptions on the night for the Buccaneers, who lost Mike Evans to a concussion and what was ultimately diagnosed as a broken collarbone in the first half.

The talented backup then took a back seat to starter Bijan Robinson, who ripped apart Buffalo's defense to the tune of 238 yards and a score of his own. Allgeier has generated some flex appeal after hitting pay dirt thrice over his last four appearances. There is a four-yard dud nestled in between, so fantasy managers should also be aware of Allgeier's drastic floor ahead of Sunday's tilt against San Francisco. </div> <h3 id="-david-njoku-te">🟡 David Njoku (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable </div> <h3 id="-evan-engram-te">🟢 Evan Engram (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Engram duplicated his production from a week ago on two more targets against New York's other football club in Week 7. The veteran tight end has quietly generated value for those in PPR formats by averaging 4.5 receptions in his past four starts. Engram will provide fantasy managers with a high floor in a soft matchup against the Cowboys next Sunday. </div> <h3 id="-brian-thomas-jr-wr">🟡 Brian Thomas Jr. (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Despite the fact that the Jaguars were playing from behind pretty much the entire game, Thomas finished third on the team in targets behind Travis Hunter (8-101-1 on 14 targets) and Parker Washington (4-52-0 on 10 targets). Thomas checked in and out of the lineup in the second half due to what seemed to be multiple nagging injuries, and he was eventually removed completely due to an apparent right shoulder issue late in the fourth quarter. The second-year wideout will have the Jaguars' Week 8 bye to get healthy, but through seven games he sports a disappointing 27-365-1 line on 55 targets. </div> <h3 id="-isiah-pacheco-rb">🟢 Isiah Pacheco (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Pacheco logged a season high in both rush attempts and rushing yards. He still wasn't particularly efficient, though he did manage three rushes of seven yards -- one of which went for his first touchdown of the season. Kareem Hunt was beat up during the game, which could have propped up Pacheco's volume. While Hunt was able to return, it will be worth monitoring his status for a Week 8 matchup against the Commanders, as Pacheco could be in for a larger workload. </div> <h3 id="-rashee-rice-wr">🟢 Rashee Rice (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Rice made his season debut after recovering from a serious knee injury while also serving a six-game suspension. He immediately regained his role as Patrick Mahomes' favorite pass catcher, as Rice led the team with 10 targets and seven receptions. Rice's work all came close to the line of scrimmage -- his longest catch of the day went for only 12 yards -- but his performance was made with a pair of scores from two and three yards away. The Chiefs were able to run a conservative offensive game plan for the entire second half, so Rice should be in for bigger performances moving forward, even considering his strong season debut. </div> <h3 id="-ladd-mcconkey-wr">🟢 Ladd McConkey (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The second-year wideout set new season highs in targets and receptions, although the increased volume didn't result in increased production -- McConkey finished third on the Chargers in receiving yards behind rookie tight end Oronde Gadsden (7-164-1 on nine targets) and Keenan Allen (11-119-1 on 14 targets), while Quentin Johnston was on the other end of Justin Herbert's third TD. It's been a disappointing sophomore campaign so far for McConkey, but he's posted a 21-206-2 line on 31 targets over the last three games, giving him momentum heading into a Week 8 clash with a Vikings secondary that just surrendered a combined 13-304-3 line to A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith. </div> <h3 id="-devon-achane-rb">🟢 De’Von Achane (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Dolphins' point total and the fact Tua Tagovailoa managed only 100 passing yards while throwing three interceptions essentially tells the tale of the type of day it was for Miami's offense as a whole. Therefore, Achane's solid numbers served as the one bright spot for Mike McDaniel's squad, and the speedy running back gained well more than half his total on a 46-yard run late in the first quarter. Achane has rattled off 210 rushing yards and a pair of Week 6 rushing touchdowns on 29 carries over his last two games, but the Dolphins' reeling offensive unit faces an unenviable Week 8 road matchup against the Falcons next Sunday afternoon. </div> <h3 id="-darius-slayton-wr">🟡 Darius Slayton (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable </div> <h3 id="-wandale-robinson-wr">🟢 Wan’Dale Robinson (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Robinson paced the Giants in receptions and yardage for the second week running, this time also surpassing Lil'Jordan Humphrey in targets. The 24-year-old Robinson is now averaging 5.7 receptions and 69.7 yards in three games since taking over for for Malik Nabers (knee) as the Giants' top wideout. Robinson provides enough upside in his current role to warrant flex consideration against the Eagles next Sunday. </div> <h3 id="-aaron-rodgers-qb">🟢 Aaron Rodgers (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Rodgers was outshined by fellow veteran signal-caller Joe Flacco, but the former still tied a season high in touchdown passes. Rodgers connected with Pat Freiermuth for half his scoring tosses -- from 19 and 68 yards out -- and his other two TD strikes went to Freiermuth's position mates Jonnu Smith (10 yards) and Darnell Washington (two yards). Rodgers made several impressive throws throughout the night, including the second touchdown to Freiermuth and his game-ending Hail Mary attempt, corroborating he still has plenty of arm strength and continues to demonstrate his mostly difficult 2024 season with the Jets may have just been a hiccup. Rodgers and his teammates will next turn their attention to a Week 8 home showdown against the Packers on Sunday night, Oct. 26. </div> <h3 id="-mike-evans-wr">🟢 Mike Evans (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Out<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Evans suffered the injury in the second quarter of Monday's loss while attempting to reel in a deep target. His absence will be a big blow to the Tampa Bay receiving corps, with Chris Godwin (leg) also banged up. Evans' streak of 11 straight campaigns with 1,000 receiving yards will also almost certainly come to an end. </div> <h3 id="-baker-mayfield-qb">🟢 Baker Mayfield (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Mayfield went into the game with both Mike Evans and Emeka Egbuka available despite their respective hamstring injuries, but he ended up losing the former to a shoulder injury -- which Rick Stroud of the Tampa Bay Times reports was subsequently diagnosed as a broken collarbone -- and a concussion in the first half. Mayfield had already been struggling to get the ball to Evans considering the pass on which he suffered the pair of injuries was his fourth target without a catch, and the veteran signal-caller displayed only modest improvement over the rest of the night even though the Lions were playing with an extremely short-handed secondary. Mayfield saw a two-game interception-less streak come to an end as well on a controversial play that originally appeared to be a Cade Otton reception, and it remains to be seen if he'll at least have Chris Godwin (fibula) at his disposal to help offset the loss of Evans in a Week 8 road matchup versus the Saints on Sunday. </div> <h3 id="-jayden-daniels-qb">🟡 Jayden Daniels (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Daniels' MRI on Monday came back clean after he was injured on the opening drive of the second half of Sunday's loss to the Cowboys. He wanted to go back in the game against Dallas, but the score was already somewhat lopsided, so the Commanders kept him out and let Marcus Mariota play the bulk of the second half. If Daniels is unable to play against Kansas City, Mariota would likely draw the start. </div> <hr/> <h2 id="-lineup-analysis">📝 Lineup Analysis</h2> <h3 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h3> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_7_2025_KTT_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <h3 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h3> <p><small><em>What you should have started for maximum points</em></small></p> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_7_2025_KTT_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <hr/> <h2 id="-week-8-optimal-projected-lineup">🔮 Week 8 Optimal Projected Lineup</h2> <div style="padding: 15px; background-color: #e7f3ff; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;"> <strong>Next Opponent:</strong> Game of Zones - House Hamlin<br/> <strong>Total Projected Points:</strong> 128.82<br/> </div> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_8_2025_KTT_projected.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> <th data-field="opponent" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="false">Opponent</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <hr/> <h2 id="-remaining-schedule-analysis">📅 Remaining Schedule Analysis</h2> <div style="padding: 15px; background-color: #fff3cd; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;"> <strong>🔥 Average Opponent Strength:</strong> 121.82 PPG </div> <table class="table table-sm table-hover"> <thead><tr> <th>Opponent</th><th>Record</th><th>Avg Points</th> </tr></thead> <tbody> <tr><td><strong>Game of Zones - House Hamlin</strong></td><td>4-3</td><td>123.08</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>Rookie Mistake</strong></td><td>3-4</td><td>116.93</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>Michael's Managable Team</strong></td><td>5-2</td><td>139.79</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>Americas Team</strong></td><td>4-3</td><td>137.28</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>To Infinity and Bijan!</strong></td><td>3-4</td><td>107.78</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>Emma's Excellent Team</strong></td><td>1-6</td><td>88.11</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>Michael's Managable Team</strong></td><td>5-2</td><td>139.79</td></tr> </tbody></table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week7"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry></feed>
