Veteran backup quarterback Kirk Cousins looked ill-prepared to command the Falcons offense without London on the field, finishing with just 173 passing yards with no touchdowns or interceptions despite facing off against a deeply flawed Miami secondary. Whether it ends up being Penix or Cousins under center on the road against New England on Sunday, it will bode well for Atlanta's aerial attack if London is able to retake the field alongside Darnell Mooney and TE Kyle Pitts. The star wideout was a late addition to the Week 8 injury report. </div> <h3 id="-justice-hill-rb">🟢 Justice Hill (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Baltimore leaned on Derrick Henry as the primary running back Sunday, and even when Hill was in, he wasn't a featured part of the offense. Hill's usage is volatile week-to-week and depends on game script where Baltimore needs to utilize his blitz pickup and pass-catching skills. Another looming threat to Hill's usage was the reintroduction of Keaton Mitchell to the backfield. Mitchell played just seven snaps but had a strong usage rate with four carries for 43 yards. Hill's role won't be deleted from the offense because he offers elements that Henry and Mitchell do not, but his snap counts could take a hit going forward if Mitchell continues to shine. </div> <h3 id="-joshua-palmer-wr">🟡 Joshua Palmer (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable </div> <h3 id="-courtland-sutton-wr">🟢 Courtland Sutton (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Sutton took a back seat to Denver's younger receiving options Sunday, watching Troy Franklin, Pat Bryant and RJ Harvey collect all of Bo Nix's touchdown passes in the blowout win. The veteran starter still produced adequate receiving totals despite failing to reach the end zone, duplicating the 67.0 yards/game average he posted over his previous seven appearances. Fantasy managers are hoping Sutton can return to the end zone against the Texans in Week 9 after he scored all three of his touchdowns in Denver's first four games of the season. </div> <h3 id="-trevor-lawrence-qb">🟢 Trevor Lawrence (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Jaguars were staring at a 21-0 deficit at halftime, so Lawrence was forced to put the ball in the air most of the second half. The volume led to a season high in passing yards for the fifth-year QB, as well as Travis Hunter's first career TD reception, but it also led to Lawrence being sacked seven times. He'll take a mediocre 9:5 TD:INT through seven games into Jacksonville's Week 8 bye. </div> <h3 id="-hollywood-brown-wr">🟢 Hollywood Brown (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Brown made an early impact in the game, hauling in an eight-yard touchdown to put the Chiefs up 14-0. He was a non-factor after that, mixing in for similar target volume with all of the Chiefs' pass catchers except Rashee Rice. Brown could pop up for decent performances throughout the rest of the season, but the return of Rice will make it difficult for Brown to retain the consistent involvement in the offense he enjoyed in the early part of the campaign. </div> <h3 id="-jakobi-meyers-wr">🟡 Jakobi Meyers (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable </div> <h3 id="-aaron-jones-sr-rb">🟢 Aaron Jones Sr. (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Jones made his return from a four-game absence and logged one more carry than backfield mate Jordan Mason, but game script significantly limited Minnesota's ability to run a balanced offense. Jones' truncated opportunities Thursday aside, the veteran back is likely to function as the lead back -- even if not by a significant margin -- over Mason moving forward, but another tough matchup awaits in Week 9 on Sunday, Nov. 2 in the form of a trip to the Motor City to face the Lions. </div> <h3 id="-rashid-shaheed-wr">🟢 Rashid Shaheed (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Shaheed's 12 targets and nine receptions crushed his previous highs of nine and six respectively, but he failed to sniff the 114 yards he posted in Week 5. The fourth-year starter has provided a nice floor for those in deeper formats, recording at least four receptions in each of his eight appearances in 2025. Shaheed's overall line of 39-431-2 looks solid on paper, but over half of his production (including both of his touchdowns) have come in three games. Expect Shaheed to continue serving as one of either Spencer Rattler's or Tyler Shough's top targets against the Rams next Sunday. </div> <h3 id="-saquon-barkley-rb">🟡 Saquon Barkley (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> When Barkley exited late in the third quarter after a 28-yard run with what eventually was termed a groin injury, the Eagles were up 24-13 on the Giants and proceeded to extend the lead to 18 points by the end of that drive. He added afterward that he likely could have remained in the contest if the score was ever in doubt down the stretch, per Tim McManus of ESPN.com. The Eagles have a Week 9 bye on tap, so he'll have time to recuperate before the Week 10 showdown against the Packers after finishing Week 8 with 18 touches for 174 yards from scrimmage and two total TDs. It should be noted that reserve RB Tank Bigsby reeled off 104 yards on nine rushes by game's end, indicating he's currently the next player up if Barkley needs to miss any time. </div> <h3 id="-brock-purdy-qb">🟡 Brock Purdy (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> One week removed from Shanahan saying it was a "stretch" for Purdy to play this past Sunday in Houston, the coach was more tepid in his phrasing, indicating that the 49ers are keeping the door open this week for the fourth-year pro to see his first game action since Week 4. Shanahan also told David Lombardi of SFStandard.com that fill-in QB Mac Jones emerged from Week 8 action with a knee contusion and is "day-to-day." As a result, the situation under center in San Francisco bears watching as the week continues to get a sense of if Purdy will resume starting duties Week 9. </div> <h3 id="-george-kittle-te">🔴 George Kittle (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Kittle commemorated the National Tight End Day quasi-holiday he helped bring about by recording his second touchdown of the season on a 17-yard grab just before halftime. Kittle had been shut out altogether in his Week 7 return from a hamstring injury, so Sunday's production was a particularly welcome sight for fantasy managers and included a new season-high yardage total for the veteran tight end. Kittle draws another favorable matchup irrespective of who his quarterback is when the 49ers face the Giants on the road in Week 9. </div> <h3 id="-tony-pollard-rb">🟢 Tony Pollard (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Pollard finished with a team-high 11 carries in Sunday's blowout loss, but it was backup Tyjae Spears (9-59-1) who produced the superior fantasy score. The 28-year-old Pollard has seen his production dip in recent weeks, tallying just 96 rushing yards with no touchdowns over his last three starts. The untimely dip in production has come alongside Spears' return from injury in Week 5, with a less-than-appealing timeshare developing in Tennessee's backfield. Pollard still retains deep-league value so long as he is starting, but expectations should be kept in check for larger formats against the Chargers next Sunday. </div> <h3 id="-zach-ertz-te">🟢 Zach Ertz (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Ertz's yardage total was his lowest for any game this season where he recorded a catch, even as he hit the six-target threshold for the third consecutive game. The veteran tight end's late first-quarter grab was also the subject of some controversy, as Ertz appeared to gain the necessary six yards for a first down on a fourth-down play before a virtual measurement reduced the gain to five yards, leading to a turnover on downs. Ertz has eclipsed 43 receiving yards just once this season, leaving him with muted fantasy prospects heading into a Week 9 home matchup against the Seahawks on Sunday night. </div> <hr/> <h2 id="-lineup-analysis">📝 Lineup Analysis</h2> <h3 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h3> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_8_2025_EET_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <h3 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h3> <p><small><em>What you should have started for maximum points</em></small></p> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_8_2025_EET_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <hr/> <h2 id="-week-9-optimal-projected-lineup">🔮 Week 9 Optimal Projected Lineup</h2> <div style="padding: 15px; background-color: #e7f3ff; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;"> <strong>Next Opponent:</strong> Americas Team<br/> <strong>Total Projected Points:</strong> 111.82<br/> </div> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_9_2025_EET_projected.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> <th data-field="opponent" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="false">Opponent</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <hr/> <h2 id="-remaining-schedule-analysis">📅 Remaining Schedule Analysis</h2> <div style="padding: 15px; background-color: #fff3cd; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;"> <strong>⚠️ Average Opponent Strength:</strong> 110.62 PPG </div> <table class="table table-sm table-hover"> <thead><tr> <th>Opponent</th><th>Record</th><th>Avg Points</th> </tr></thead> <tbody> <tr><td><strong>Americas Team</strong></td><td>4-4</td><td>127.69</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>Big Titi Energy</strong></td><td>2-6</td><td>100.00</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>To Infinity and Bijan!</strong></td><td>3-5</td><td>106.28</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>Abbey's TNT Team</strong></td><td>5-3</td><td>114.84</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>Mcconky Donkeys</strong></td><td>4-4</td><td>108.62</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>To Infinity and Bijan!</strong></td><td>3-5</td><td>106.28</td></tr> </tbody></table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week8"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Week 8 League Recap</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-8_Recap/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Week 8 League Recap"/><published>2025-10-28T12:34:05+00:00</published><updated>2025-10-28T12:34:05+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-8_Recap</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-8_Recap/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="-week-at-a-glance">📊 Week at a Glance</h2> <style>table[data-toggle="table"] tbody td{color:#2c3e50!important}</style> <h3 id="matchup-results">Matchup Results</h3> <p><strong>Mama Daughter Duo</strong> 133.26 -

</code></pre> <hr/> <h2 id="-player-report">🏥 Player Report</h2> <h3 id="-jacoby-brissett-qb">🟢 Jacoby Brissett (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Making his second straight start in place of Kyler Murray (foot), Brissett had another productive performance as he connected with Trey McBride for a 15-yard score in the second quarter and a 12-yard strike in the third. The veteran QB has thrown for 599 yards in place of Murray -- the best two-game stretch of his career -- with a 4:1 TD:INT, but with Arizona on bye in Week 8, Brissett may be returning to the bench for a Week 9 tilt against the Cowboys' porous defense. </div> <h3 id="-roschon-johnson-rb">🟡 Roschon Johnson (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable </div> <h3 id="-dj-moore-wr">🟢 DJ Moore (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The 73 yards were a season high for Moore, although most of that production came late in the fourth quarter on a desperation heave by Caleb Williams that the 28-year-old wideout made a spectacular one-handed grab on as he raced down the sideline. Moore has taken a back seat to Rome Odunze in the Bears' passing game this season, leaving him with a 26-331-1 line on 38 targets through seven games, but he's maintained a steady PPR floor by catching at least three passes in every contest. Moore will look for a ceiling game in Week 9 against the Bengals. </div> <h3 id="-joe-flacco-qb">🟡 Joe Flacco (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Flacco appears to have injured his shoulder during Cincinnati's dramatic 39-38 loss to the Jets in Week 8 in which the veteran signal-caller completed 21 of 34 passes for 233 yards and two touchdowns, while rushing twice for 14 yards and another score. Taylor said Flacco is "sore" Monday. In three starts since being traded to the Bengals, Flacco has rejuvenated Cincinnati's offense, throwing multiple touchdowns and compiling over 200 passing yards in all of those contests. His health will need to be closely monitored as the Bengals prepare to host the Bears in Week 9 on Sunday, Nov. 2. If Flacco is limited, or if backup Jake Browning is thrust into the lineup, it will represent a blow to the fantasy value of all of WRs Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins and RB Chase Brown. </div> <h3 id="-tee-higgins-wr">🟢 Tee Higgins (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Higgins got free for a 44-yard touchdown in the second quarter, but that was his only catch as he was out-targeted 19-2 by Ja'Marr Chase. Higgins has scored in three of his last four games and has 202 yards in three games since Joe Flacco took over under center in Cincinnati. While the gap between Chase and Higgins is sizable, Higgins has been much more of a factor with Flacco than he had been while catching passes from Jake Browning. Higgins and the Bengals will host the Bears in Week 9. </div> <h3 id="-cj-stroud-qb">🟢 C.J. Stroud (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Stroud was in a zone throughout most of the afternoon following a difficult performance on the road against the Seahawks on Monday night to close out Week 7. The third-year signal-caller was working without Nico Collins (concussion) and Christian Kirk (hamstring), but he recorded 14 of his completions to a trio of wideouts playing elevated roles in Xavier Hutchinson, Jaylin Noel and Jayden Higgins. Stroud's pair of scoring tosses went to Hutchinson (30 yards) and Higgins (12 yards) as well, and his yardage total was a season-high figure. Stroud now has multiple touchdown passes in three of the last four games, but he has an unenviable task on tap in Week 9 in the form of a home matchup against the Broncos. </div> <h3 id="-jj-mccarthy-qb">🔴 J.J. McCarthy (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable </div> <h3 id="-juwan-johnson-te">🟢 Juwan Johnson (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Johnson logged five catches on at least seven targets for the second week in a row. The tight end once again finished third on the team in targets, receptions, and yards behind wide receivers Chris Olave (12-8-63) and Rashid Shaheed (12-9-75). The Saints benched starting quarterback Spencer Rattler for rookie Tyler Shough in the third quarter, as the passing offense continued to struggle in this game. New Orleans still logged 51 passing attempts as a team. If the team continues to air it out while playing from behind, then Johnson's fantasy production should benefit with a healthy number of targets going forward. New Orleans' next game will come versus the Rams in Week 8. </div> <h3 id="-devin-neal-rb">🟢 Devin Neal (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The rookie sixth-rounder served as the Saints' RB2 with Kendre Miller out for the season after suffering a torn ACL in Week 7. New Orleans benched starting quarterback Spencer Rattler for rookie Tyler Shough late in the third quarter, and the offense abandoned the running game with just 15 carries as a team. Neal still played 46 percent of offensive snaps while operating behind Alvin Kamara, who only played 51 percent of offensive snaps. Neal will look for more rushing opportunities as New Orleans' offense looks to right the ship Week 8 versus the Rams. </div> <h3 id="-breece-hall-rb">🟢 Breece Hall (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Hall scored his first touchdown of the season on a five-yard run early in the fourth quarter, then doubled that total with a 27-yard touchdown run that featured some impressive footwork to stay inbounds along the sideline. He capped the improbable fourth-quarter comeback with a four-yard touchdown pass to Mason Taylor, as the ensuing PAT gave the Jets their first lead of the game with 1:54 remaining before the defense closed the door. Hall will have a Week 9 bye to help his recovery from a knee injury that limited his practice participation and had him listed as questionable heading into Sunday's win, and he should reprise his role as the team's top backfield option in Week 10 against the Browns. </div> <h3 id="-josh-reynolds-wr">🟢 Josh Reynolds (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Injured Reserve<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Reynolds appeared on Friday's injury report due to a hip injury. Not only has he been ruled out for Sunday's game against the Bengals, but the injury is severe enough to warrant a stint on IR for the veteran wide receiver. Reynolds will be required to miss at least the next four games, which makes Week 13 against the Falcons on Sunday, Nov. 30 the earliest he is eligible to return. With Reynolds on IR and Garrett Wilson (knee) ruled out for Week 8, the Jets' wide receiver corps will consist of Arian Smith, Allen Lazard, Tyler Johnson, Isaiah Williams and Brandon Smith. </div> <h3 id="-dallas-goedert-te">🟢 Dallas Goedert (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> While he didn't see much volume, Goedert celebrated National Tight End Day in style with a six-yard TD in the second quarter and a 17-yard score in the fourth. The veteran TE may be disappointed he won't get to play the Giants again in 2025 after racking up 12 catches on 14 targets for 138 yards and three touchdowns against them in two meetings. Goedert rolls into the Eagles' Week 9 bye with an overall 30-289-7 line on 39 targets through seven contests. </div> <h3 id="-kendrick-bourne-wr">🟢 Kendrick Bourne (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Bourne was second in receiving yards on the 49ers despite his modest total, and he contributed a pair of first downs on his trio of grabs. Bourne continues to work as the No. 2 receiver due to the absence of Ricky Pearsall (knee), but after back-to-back 142-yard tallies versus the Rams and Buccaneers in Weeks 5 and 6, the Eastern Washington product has generated a modest 5-58-0 line on six targets over the subsequent pair of contests. Bourne will continue working in a starting role if Pearsall is unable to return for next Sunday's Week 9 matchup on the road against the Giants. </div> <h3 id="-zach-charbonnet-rb">🟢 Zach Charbonnet (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Charbonnet was the money-maker out of Seattle's talented backfield duo Monday, cashing in both of his team's rushing touchdowns on the evening. Kenneth Walker (17-66-0) received five more carries and was the game's leading rusher, but it is obvious which stat line fantasy GMs would have preferred in Week 7. Charbonnet has five touchdowns in six games, but his usage in short yardage and at the goal line has contributed to a career-worst 2.8 YPC. The skilled backup should continue generating flex value when the Seahawks come out of a Week 8 bye to face the Commanders on Nov. 2. </div> <h3 id="-kenneth-walker-iii-rb">🟢 Kenneth Walker III (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Walked finished as the Seahawks' leading rusher with a team-high number of rushes on Monday Night Football. However, fellow RB Zach Charbonnet cashed in on a pair of goal-line carries en route to a 12-49-2 rushing line. Walker still is providing more volume out of Seattle's backfield through seven weeks, generating 430 rushing yards off of a career-best 4.7 YPC with three trips to the end zone himself. Both talented rushers will be worth starting in fantasy when the Seahawks return from the upcoming bye week to face the Commanders on Sunday, Nov. 2. </div> <h3 id="-terry-mclaurin-wr">🟡 Terry McLaurin (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> McLaurin left the game in the fourth quarter with the Commanders trailing by multiple touchdowns, so perhaps it was a bit precautionary on Washington's end to keep him out for the remainder of the contest. However, it does sound like the veteran wideout did aggravate the previous quad injury that kept him out the previous four games prior to his return to action Monday. The Commanders now are on a short week ahead of next Sunday's home game against the Seahawks. McLaurin should be considered questionable for the Week 9 affair. </div> <hr/> <h2 id="-lineup-analysis">📝 Lineup Analysis</h2> <h3 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h3> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_8_2025_BTE_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <h3 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h3> <p><small><em>What you should have started for maximum points</em></small></p> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_8_2025_BTE_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <hr/> <h2 id="-week-9-optimal-projected-lineup">🔮 Week 9 Optimal Projected Lineup</h2> <div style="padding: 15px; background-color: #e7f3ff; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;"> <strong>Next Opponent:</strong> Mama Daughter Duo<br/> <strong>Total Projected Points:</strong> 105.01<br/> </div> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_9_2025_BTE_projected.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> <th data-field="opponent" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="false">Opponent</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <hr/> <h2 id="-remaining-schedule-analysis">📅 Remaining Schedule Analysis</h2> <div style="padding: 15px; background-color: #fff3cd; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;"> <strong>⚠️ Average Opponent Strength:</strong> 115.35 PPG </div> <table class="table table-sm table-hover"> <thead><tr> <th>Opponent</th><th>Record</th><th>Avg Points</th> </tr></thead> <tbody> <tr><td><strong>Mama Daughter Duo</strong></td><td>4-4</td><td>135.07</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>Emma's Excellent Team</strong></td><td>1-7</td><td>84.69</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>Abbey's TNT Team</strong></td><td>5-3</td><td>114.84</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>Game of Zones - House Hamlin</strong></td><td>5-3</td><td>125.06</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>Rookie Mistake</strong></td><td>4-4</td><td>117.57</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>Abbey's TNT Team</strong></td><td>5-3</td><td>114.84</td></tr> </tbody></table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week8"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">To Infinity and Bijan!

The disappointing showing featured a season-low receiving yardage total for Mooney, who now has two one-catch tallies in his last three appearances heading into a Week 9 road matchup against a tough Patriots defense. </div> <h3 id="-kyle-pitts-sr-te">🟢 Kyle Pitts Sr. (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Pitts led the Falcons in receptions, receiving yards and targets on the afternoon, as the absence of Drake London (hip) opened up plenty of extra opportunity. Pitts was the only Atlanta pass catcher to truly take advantage, however, working seamlessly with fill-in signal-caller Kirk Cousins on his way to a season-high catch total. After multiple seasons of what has been perceived as underutilization in the passing attack, Atlanta's coaching staff is seemingly prioritizing keeping Pitts involved, as he'll take a 39-344-1 receiving line on 47 targets into a Week 9 road matchup against the Patriots. </div> <h3 id="-mark-andrews-te">🟢 Mark Andrews (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> He didn't see much volume with Tyler Huntley under center in place of Lamar Jackson (hamstring), but Andrews did have one big gain in the second quarter with a 24-yard reception that helped set up a field goal. The 34 yards on the afternoon actually represented his second-best total of the season, and Andrews has delivered a 24-208-2 line on 30 targets through seven contests. If Jackson returns in Week 9, his long-time chemistry with Andrews could boost the veteran tight end's numbers on the road against the Dolphins. </div> <h3 id="-keon-coleman-wr">🟢 Keon Coleman (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Coleman finished a distant second to Khalil Shakir in receptions, receiving yards and targets, turning in his sixth straight sub-50-yard effort following his 112-yard tally against the Ravens in Week 1. The second-year wideout is averaging just 9.9 yards per reception and has taken just three of his 27 catches for 20-plus yards, a sharp contrast to the outstanding 19.2 yards per grab he averaged as a rookie in the 2024 regular season. Coleman will aim to make a bigger impact in a Week 9 home showdown against the Chiefs next Sunday afternoon. </div> <h3 id="-tetairoa-mcmillan-wr">🟢 Tetairoa McMillan (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> McMillan was essentially the lone bright spot for the Panthers in the embarrassing loss, easily leading Carolina across the board in receptions, receiving yards and targets. The rookie first-round pick showed good chemistry with Andy Dalton, and the talented wideout's catch total was a new career high while his target tally tied his high-water mark over the first eight games. McMillan should remain busy in a Week 9 road trip to Green Bay, a game in which the Panthers may have to eventually take a pass-centric approach. </div> <h3 id="-javonte-williams-rb">🟢 Javonte Williams (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Williams scored a pair of one-yard rushing touchdowns to bring his season total to eight rushing scores, but Dallas otherwise failed to find the end zone against the stout Denver defense until after waving the white flag and inserting backup quarterback Joe Milton. Williams, the former Broncos running back, continues to dominate touches in Dallas' backfield, especially once top backup Miles Sanders (knee) was ruled out for the season. Williams and the Cowboys host the Cardinals on Monday Night Football in Week 9. </div> <h3 id="-marvin-mims-jr-wr">🟡 Marvin Mims Jr. (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Mims was injured late in the win over Dallas. Prior to getting hurt, the 2023 second-round pick didn't catch his only target and rushed three times for 18 yards. He also had three kickoff returns for 93 yards, two punt returns for 26 yards and drew a 32-yard defensive pass interference penalty. Mims will need to clear concussion protocol to have a chance to play in Week 9 against the Texans. </div> <h3 id="-josh-jacobs-rb">🟢 Josh Jacobs (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Jacobs was headed towards his worst fantasy performance of the season before punching in a touchdown late in the fourth quarter on Sunday Night Football. Green Bay's workhorse was held to 2.5 yards per carry, opening the door for backup Emanuel Wilson to lead the team with 61 rushing yards on 11 attempts. Jacobs was dealing with a calf injury during the practice week, which could help explain his poor efficiency in Sunday's victory. The late score extended Jacobs' touchdown streak to four games, rewarding fantasy managers with seven trips to the end zone over that span. Assuming he escaped this contest unscathed, Jacobs should be treated as an elite asset in a soft matchup against the Panthers next Sunday. </div> <h3 id="-nick-chubb-rb">🟢 Nick Chubb (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Chubb received six more carries than rookie backfield mate Woody Marks, but the latter outgained the veteran by six yards despite the lesser workload. Marks also stood out by doubling Chubb's reception total and gaining 36 more receiving yards, but head coach DeMeco Ryans appears intent on keeping Chubb involved as both a runner and receiver. Nevertheless, with a middling 4.0 yards-per-carry average, Chubb could eventually swap places in the backfield pecking order with Marks. </div> <h3 id="-quentin-johnston-wr">🟢 Quentin Johnston (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Johnston was on the field for 38 of 73 offensive snaps, trailing Tre' Harris (43) and Ladd McConkey (42) but finishing well ahead of Keenan Allen (18). Harris has an overlapping skill set with Johnston, and the rookie second-round pick could gradually supplant Johnston as the team's go-to deep threat. Johnston exceeded 70 receiving yards in each of his first four appearances this season while scoring four touchdowns over that span, but he has just 70 yards and one touchdown in his last three games combined. His next opportunity to bounce back will arrive against the Titans in Week 9. </div> <h3 id="-carson-wentz-qb">🟢 Carson Wentz (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Injured Reserve<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Wentz played the majority of snaps in Minnesota's last five games with J.J. McCarthy (ankle) working his way back from a multi-week injury, but the veteran was clearly playing through pain during last Thursday's 37-10 loss to the Chargers. Per Dane Mizutani of the St. Paul Pioneer Press, the Vikings have officially placed Wentz on IR. The transaction confirms that McCarthy will start Sunday's road matchup against the Lions, if healthy, and leaves Max Brosmer in position to handle No. 2 quarterback duties for Minnesota. </div> <h3 id="-theo-johnson-te">🟢 Theo Johnson (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Johnson has scored four touchdowns in his last five games, but the Eagles managed to keep him out of the end zone in both meetings over that span. Fellow Giants tight end Daniel Bellinger exited due to a neck injury, which could open up more targets for Johnson if Bellinger doesn't return in Week 9 against the 49ers. </div> <h3 id="-justin-fields-qb">🟢 Justin Fields (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Glenn praised Fields' performance during Sunday's 39-38 win over the Bengals, saying he "managed the game really well," while also noting that "there are still some things within that game that [Fields] knows he has to improve on." Still, Glenn did not reveal whether Fields or Tyrod Taylor will start under center at home against the Browns on Sunday, Nov. 9. Taylor seemed to be trending toward the start versus Cincinnati prior to being ruled out with a knee injury, but Fields' performance may have been sufficient to earn him further time in the No. 1 seat. Whoever is under center Week 10 could benefit from the return of WR Garrett Wilson (knee). </div> <h3 id="-chris-godwin-jr-wr">🔴 Chris Godwin Jr. (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa;

</code></pre> <hr/> <h2 id="-player-report">🏥 Player Report</h2> <h3 id="-kirk-cousins-qb">🟢 Kirk Cousins (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Making his first start since Week 15 of last season, Cousins understandably had some rust to work through, and he also had the disadvantage of having to operate without No. 1 receiver Drake London (hip). Cousins eventually developed a bit of rhythm as the game went on, but he averaged just 5.6 yards per attempt and focused the overwhelming majority of his attention on Kyle Pitts. Cousins could certainly be better now that he has a game under his belt and with another week of practice -- not to mention with London at his disposal -- but it remains to be seen if he'll have that opportunity in a Week 9 road matchup against the Patriots or whether Penix will be healthy enough to start that game. </div> <h3 id="-lamar-jackson-qb">🟡 Lamar Jackson (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Jackson's listed activity level to begin Week 9 prep backs up language from coach John Harbaugh earlier Monday, when he told Jeff Zrebiec of The Athletic, "I feel very confident about it. I expect him to be out there Thursday." Jackson thus appears to have a good chance to put an end to a three-game absence due to a right hamstring injury for the Ravens' Week 9 contest at Miami. </div> <h3 id="-quinshon-judkins-rb">🟡 Quinshon Judkins (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Judkins was forced out of Sunday's loss to the Patriots in the third quarter, prior to which he rushed nine times for 19 yards and secured all three of his targets for minus-2 yards. To see the rookie second-round pick now labeled day-to-day is encouraging as to his odds of being ready to return to action after Cleveland's Week 9 bye, when the team will travel to face the Jets on Sunday, Nov. 9. If Judkins isn't ready to retake the field Week 10, however, Jerome Ford and Dylan Sampson will lead the Browns backfield. Ian Rapoport of NFL Network reports that Judkins is dealing with an AC joint sprain. </div> <h3 id="-jameson-williams-wr">🟢 Jameson Williams (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The usually sure-handed Williams failed to haul in either of his targets on a low-volume passing night dominated by Detroit's run game. The 24-year-old has been a hit-or-miss fantasy asset through seven weeks, doing most of his damage in two big-scoring games. Williams couldn't improve on his 17-289-2 receiving line Monday as the Lions prepare to enter a bye week. The Alabama product should continue to be treated as a risky high-upside play against the Vikings in Week 9. </div> <h3 id="-nico-collins-wr">🟡 Nico Collins (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable </div> <h3 id="-jonathan-taylor-rb">🟢 Jonathan Taylor (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Taylor continues to score in threes, producing his fourth three-touchdown game in eight starts this season. It was the 26-year-old's second consecutive contest scoring thrice and the second time he has accomplished the feat against Tennessee this year. In addition to his monstrous rushing totals (143-850-13), Taylor has made strides as a receiver in 2025. The Wisconsin grad has 25 receptions for 206 yards and two touchdowns the midpoint of the schedule nears, a rate that would eclipse the 40-360-2 receiving line he posted during his breakout campaign back in 2021. Taylor will ride a wave of momentum into next Sunday's tilt against the Steelers' 19th-ranked rush defense. </div> <h3 id="-brock-bowers-te">🔴 Brock Bowers (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable </div> <h3 id="-oronde-gadsden-ii-te">🟢 Oronde Gadsden II (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Gadsden was second to Ladd McConkey in receptions and receiving yards while also tying for runner-up status in targets with Keenan Allen. The rookie tight end added his second career touchdown via an eight-yard scoring grab with just over four minutes remaining in the first quarter. The chemistry between Justin Herbert and Gadsden has spiked in the last three games, a stretch where they've connected for 19 catches, 309 yards and the two scores on 22 targets. Gadsden will aim to carry over the momentum into a favorable Week 9 road clash with the beatable Titans defense on Sunday, Nov. 2. </div> <h3 id="-kimani-vidal-rb">🟢 Kimani Vidal (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Following an impressive Week 6 showing against the Dolphins where Vidal compiled a career-best 124 yards, the 2024 sixth-round pick was stymied by the Colts to the tune of 20 yards on just nine carries Sunday. However, the second-year pro bounced back in spectacular fashion Thursday, averaging just over 5.0 yards per tote while rattling off three runs of double-digit yardage. He also added a three-yard scoring run early in the second quarter for his first NFL touchdown, rounding out his night nicely. Vidal appears fully capable of holding down the fort in the ground attack until Omarion Hampton (IR, ankle) is ready to return, and he could well put together a successful encore on the road in Week 9 when Los Angeles faces the vulnerable Titans on Nov. 2. </div> <h3 id="-tua-tagovailoa-qb">🟢 Tua Tagovailoa (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Tagovailoa came into the afternoon dealing with an illness that forced him onto the injury report early Sunday morning, but he and the Dolphins conquered heavy odds to deliver a completely unexpected comfortable victory. Tagovailoa tossed a season-high four touchdown passes, hitting running backs De'Von Achane and Ollie Gordon from three and 20 yards out, respectively, and sandwiching those throws around nine- and 43-yard scoring strikes to Malik Washington and Jaylen Waddle. This was a much-needed respite from both individual and team struggles for Tagovailoa and his teammates, but he'll have to turn around and face another talented defense in that of the Ravens during a Week 9 home matchup Thursday night. </div> <h3 id="-jaylen-waddle-wr">🟢 Jaylen Waddle (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Although he came up just short of the century mark, Waddle still paced the Dolphins in receptions and receiving yards while checking in second in targets. Nearly half of his yardage came on the highlight play of his afternoon, a 43-yard touchdown grab in the latter portion of the third quarter. Waddle's production has unsurprisingly picked up since Tyreek Hill's season-ending knee injury, as the talented fifth-year wideout has recorded at least 95 receiving yards in three of his last four games while logging at least six targets in each of those contests. Waddle next sets his sights on an inconsistent Ravens secondary, which he'll face off against in a Week 9 home matchup Thursday night. </div> <h3 id="-jordan-addison-wr">🟢 Jordan Addison (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Vikings' offense had a mostly forgettable performance as the final score indicates, but Addison still found a way to continue making an impact by recording a four-yard touchdown catch with just under five minutes remaining in the third quarter. Addison has scored twice over his first four games after the delayed start to his season, and he's likely to have his first regular-season opportunity to work with J.J. McCarthy (ankle) as his quarterback in a Week 9 road matchup against the Lions on Sunday, Nov. 2. </div> <h3 id="-garrett-wilson-wr">🟢 Garrett Wilson (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Out<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> out </div> <h3 id="-jaylen-warren-rb">🟢 Jaylen Warren (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Warren cooled off following last week's 127-yard rushing performance, reverting to the modest production he's logged most weeks as the Steelers' starter this season. The 26-year-old actually finished Sunday's primetime tilt right at the 62.2 yards he averaged over his previous five contests. Backup Kenneth Gainwell finished with 31 yards on five carries, but he coughed up Pittsburgh's only fumble on the evening. Warren carries a high floor as the Steelers' lead back heading into a Week 9 matchup against the Colts. </div> <h3 id="-jauan-jennings-wr">🟢 Jauan Jennings (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Jennings finished as the team leader in receiving yards and targets while tying for the top mark in receptions as well, but his line could have been much fuller had the veteran wideout not dropped a catchable ball from Mac Jones midway through the third quarter. Jennings has consecutive four-catch tallies, but he's mostly been unable to capitalize on the ongoing absences of Brandon Aiyuk (PUP, knee) and Ricky Pearsall (knee). Jennings, who's dealt with multiple injuries in his own right and missed two games this season, will take an 18-212-1 receiving line on 36 targets into a Week 9 road matchup against the Giants. </div> <h3 id="-tyjae-spears-rb">🟢 Tyjae Spears (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Tony Pollard led Tennessee with 11 carries, but Spears outproduced the veteran starter in every other facet Sunday. The nine carries also represented a new personal best through four healthy appearances this season. The 1-7 Titans may opt to feature the 24-year-old more prominently in the second half of the season if the team offense continues to struggle. As for Week 9, Spears remains stuck in a timeshare with Pollard, limiting both players' value to deeper formats against the Chargers next Sunday. </div> <hr/> <h2 id="-lineup-analysis">📝 Lineup Analysis</h2> <h3 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h3> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_8_2025_90s_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <h3 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h3> <p><small><em>What you should have started for maximum points</em></small></p> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_8_2025_90s_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <hr/> <h2 id="-week-9-optimal-projected-lineup">🔮 Week 9 Optimal Projected Lineup</h2> <div style="padding: 15px;

Allgeier has averaged just 3.6 YPC on his 57 rushes in six contests this season, but he could take advantage of the touches that don't go to top RB Bijan Robinson against a Miami defense that has allowed the fourth-most YPC (5.2) to opposing running backs in 2025. </div> <h3 id="-david-njoku-te">🟢 David Njoku (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> After missing last week's game with a knee issue, Njoku returned to action and made a splash with an 11-yard TD catch from Dillon Gabriel in the fourth quarter. The veteran also saw rookie Harold Fannin hit paydirt as well, and the duo have emerged as Gabriel's most reliable options, at the expense of the team's wideouts. Njoku will rest up on the Browns' Week 9 bye before facing the Jets in Week 10. </div> <h3 id="-troy-franklin-wr">🟢 Troy Franklin (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Franklin matched his previous season highs in receptions (eight) and yards (89) set back in Week 2, but he usurped that fantasy score by hitting pay dirt twice in Week 8. The second-year wideout finished below 20 receiving yards in three out of the five contests in between his standout performances, highlighting his volatility as a fantasy asset on a week-to-week basis. Managers should be wary of Franklin's downside before starting him ahead of more-proven options in a tough matchup against the Texans next Sunday. </div> <h3 id="-brian-thomas-jr-wr">🟡 Brian Thomas Jr. (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Despite the fact that the Jaguars were playing from behind pretty much the entire game, Thomas finished third on the team in targets behind Travis Hunter (8-101-1 on 14 targets) and Parker Washington (4-52-0 on 10 targets). Thomas checked in and out of the lineup in the second half due to what seemed to be multiple nagging injuries, and he was eventually removed completely due to an apparent right shoulder issue late in the fourth quarter. The second-year wideout will have the Jaguars' Week 8 bye to get healthy, but through seven games he sports a disappointing 27-365-1 line on 55 targets. </div> <h3 id="-isiah-pacheco-rb">🟢 Isiah Pacheco (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Pacheco finished as the Chiefs' leading rusher a week after scoring his first touchdown of the season. His 58 rushing yards also represented a new high-water mark through eight appearances, which also highlights his capped production as part of a backfield committee. Teammate Kareem Hunt still finished with the superior fantasy score after cashing in a pair of touchdowns in the lopsided win. Pacheco did absorb a hard shot to his knee late in the contest, but he was seen moving freely on the sidelines after being checked out by the medical staff. Fantasy managers will want to monitor the rotation piece's status during the practice week ahead of a potential shootout against the Bills in Week 9. </div> <h3 id="-rashee-rice-wr">🟢 Rashee Rice (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Rice stayed red-hot following his two-score debut in Week 7 with another trip to the end zone against the Commanders on Monday Night Football. In addition to his stellar receiving totals, the 25-year-old chipped in a pair of rare rushing attempts, matching the combined number of attempts from his first two seasons as a pro. Rice has accumulated 147 yards from scrimmage and three touchdowns on 21 touches while reclaiming the No. 1 receiver role for Kansas City in two starts since returning from a six-game suspension. Fantasy managers have to feel great about Rice's role and production heading into a potential shootout against Buffalo on Sunday. </div> <h3 id="-tyler-lockett-wr">🟢 Tyler Lockett (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Raiders waived wide receiver Justin Shorter to make room for Lockett on the 53-man roster. Lockett wasn't exactly productive across seven regular-season appearances with the Titans in 2025, recording just 10 catches for 70 yards on 20 targets, but he provides Las Vegas with veteran assistance behind top wideout Jakobi Meyers. Lockett will compete with third-year pro Tre Tucker and rookies Jack Bech and Dont'e Thornton for routes and targets with his new team, beginning Sunday at home against the Jaguars. </div> <h3 id="-devon-achane-rb">🟢 De’Von Achane (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Achane crossed the goal with a three-yard touchdown reception late in the first quarter to cap off a marathon 13-play drive that absorbed over eight minutes of clock. The speedy running back was generally contained on the ground while recording a long run of just 12 yards, and he also saw rookie backfield mate Ollie Gordon log a career-high 10 carries. Nevertheless, Achane's workload on the ground qualified as his second highest of the season, and he now has at least Sunday's yardage tally in three straight games, his best stretch of the season. Achane and the Dolphins will aim to carry over the momentum from their unexpectedly successful performance into a Week 9 home matchup against the Ravens on Thursday night. </div> <h3 id="-darius-slayton-wr">🟢 Darius Slayton (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Slayton's stat line would have looked much better if his 68-yard fourth-quarter touchdown catch hadn't been called back due to a ticky-tack offensive pass interference call. Even so, Slayton still led the Giants in targets in his return from a two-game absence. With Malik Nabers (knee) done for the year and Wan'Dale Robinson rarely capable of contributing more than a few yards beyond the line of scrimmage, Slayton should continue to work as Jaxson Dart's top downfield target in Week 9 against the 49ers. </div> <h3 id="-wandale-robinson-wr">🟢 Wan’Dale Robinson (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Robinson led the Giants in receiving yards on a quiet day for Jaxson Dart and the passing game. Darius Slayton (hamstring) returned from a two-game absence and led the team with five targets. Robinson should continue to operate underneath, while Slayton works as the team's top downfield wide receiver in Week 9 against the 49ers. </div> <h3 id="-aaron-rodgers-qb">🟢 Aaron Rodgers (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Rodgers failed to lift Pittsburgh to its fifth win after coming up short against his former club on the national stage. The 41-year-old still produced a solid fantasy score after throwing multiple touchdowns for the fifth time in seven starts with the Steelers. With 16 touchdown passes on the year, Rodgers is on pace to finish with 30-plus touchdowns for the first time since 2022, his final season as a member of the Packers. The future Hall of Famer will have to overcome a tough matchup against the Colts next Sunday in order to get Pittsburgh back in the win column following consecutive losses. </div> <h3 id="-baker-mayfield-qb">🟢 Baker Mayfield (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Tampa Bay's defense (one touchdown), running game (one touchdown) and special teams (11 points) generated all of Tampa Bay's scoring in Sunday's one-sided victory. The unfavorable game script and Mayfield's first lost fumble of the season resulted in his worst fantasy score this campaign. The early MVP candidate's 152 passing yards also checked in as his lowest total through eight starts. Mayfield is still providing fantasy managers with 1,919 passing yards and 13 touchdowns (three turnovers) following the low-use outing, putting him on pace for a third consecutive 4,000-yard season.

Veteran backup Kirk Cousins struggled to move the offense in place of Penix, completing 21 of 31 passes for 173 yards with no touchdowns (or interceptions) during the 34-10 loss while also rushing twice for two yards. It will bode well for the Falcons offense if both Penix and London are able to get back on the field as the team prepares for a Week 9 road matchup against New England. Penix was limited in practice all of Week 8 due to a bone bruise in his knee, so he may need to resume handling full reps before being cleared to return to the starting lineup. </div> <h3 id="-rome-odunze-wr">🟢 Rome Odunze (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Olamide Zaccheaus tied him for the team lead in receptions, but otherwise Odunze was Caleb Williams' clear top downfield option again after a couple lackluster performances, as he topped 100 yards for the first time since Week 2. The second-year wideout sports a 31-473-5 line on 56 targets through seven games, and Odunze will take renewed momentum into a Week 9 clash with the Bengals. </div> <h3 id="-dandre-swift-rb">🟢 D’Andre Swift (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The 26-year-old running back accounted for Chicago's only TD of the day on a two-yard run early in the fourth quarter that briefly brought the team within a field goal at 16-13. Swift has a four-game touchdown streak going, scoring three on the ground and one through the air, and over that stretch he's averaged 111 scrimmage yards a contest. Swift could be headed for another big performance in Week 9 against a vulnerable Bengals defense that just got gashed by Breece Hall for 133 rushing yards and two TDs, plus a four-yard touchdown toss on a trick play. </div> <h3 id="-caleb-williams-qb">🟢 Caleb Williams (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The second-year quarterback was able to move the ball early, but Williams' inability to get the ball into the end zone eventually cost the Bears after their first two drives ended in field goals. It's the second straight game in which he's failed to produce a TD, and both came against what were statistically poor defenses in New Orleans and Baltimore. Williams will try to get back on track against another vulnerable unit in Week 9 as Chicago faces a Cincinnati defense that just squandered a late lead and handed Justin Fields and the Jets their first win of the season. </div> <h3 id="-travis-kelce-te">🟢 Travis Kelce (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Kelce turned back the clock with a vintage stat line while leading his club in receiving in a one-sided victory. It also was the most yards the star tight end has recorded in a game through eight starts in 2025. The return of top wideout Rashee Rice in Week 7 has not cut into Kelce's production, with the latter averaging 4.5 receptions and 76.5 yards in the two games QB Patrick Mahomes' top targets have been active together this year. Look for Kelce to remain involved against the Bills in a matchup between AFC contenders Sunday. </div> <h3 id="-hunter-henry-te">🟢 Hunter Henry (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Fortunately for those who had Henry in Week 8 lineups, his season low in targets still yielded fantasy production. Looking ahead to the Patriots' Week 9 game against the Falcons, Henry -- who was on the field for 52 of 68 snaps on offense versus Cleveland, per Mike Reiss of ESPN.com -- merits fantasy consideration given that he continues to see steady playing time and has compiled a 25-317-4 receiving line on 37 targets through eight games. </div> <h3 id="-chris-olave-wr">🟢 Chris Olave (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Olave was unable to replicate last week's multi-score performance, but he still escaped Sunday's one-sided loss with a solid PPR score. The Saints' top wideout finished with double-digit targets for the sixth time in eight appearances this season. Olave has surpassed last year's production in an injury-shortened season with a 52-503-3 receiving line through eight starts in 2025. The Ohio State product checks in as New Orleans' safest fantasy option heading into next Sunday's tilt against the Rams. </div> <h3 id="-will-shipley-rb">🟢 Will Shipley (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Shipley appears to have slipped to third on the depth chart, as his eight offensive snaps were only half of those played by Tank Bigsby, who carried the ball nine times. Saquon Barkley exited with a groin injury at the end of the third quarter but believes he'll be good to go after the team's Week 9 bye. If Barkley does wind up missing time, Shipley should play a larger role than normal in Week 10 against the Packers but would likely still see fewer touches than Bigsby. </div> <h3 id="-devonta-smith-wr">🟢 DeVonta Smith (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> With A.J. Brown (hamstring) sidelined, Smith led the Eagles in catches, targets and receiving yards, although he watched all four of Jalen Hurts' TD passes go to teammates. Philly gets a Week 9 bye, so Brown may not miss any further action, but the bigger issue for the defending champions might be the groin injury Saquon Barkley picked up in Sunday's win. Even if Barkley is healthy when the Eagles head to Green Bay in Week 10, Smith still sports an impressive 44-588-2 line on 55 targets through eight games as part of a surging passing attack. </div> <h3 id="-jalen-hurts-qb">🟢 Jalen Hurts (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Eagles QB didn't need to air it out much, as both Saquon Barkley (groin) and Tank Bigsby topped 100 rushing yards on the afternoon, but Hurts was surgical when he did throw it, hitting Dallas Goedert for a pair of TDs and sending one each to Barkley and Jahan Dotson. The four scores tied Hurts' career high, a mark he reached in both 2022 and 2023, and he's thrown multiple touchdowns in five of the last six contests, amassing a 15:1 TD:INT over that stretch. Hurts will get a well-earned rest on Philly's Week 9 bye before taking on the Packers at Lambeau Field in Week 10. </div> <h3 id="-kaleb-johnson-rb">🟢 Kaleb Johnson (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Johnson's lack of usage continued during Sunday's primetime matchup, as he was held off the field for a second consecutive matchup. The rookie entered the season with intriguing potential, but Jaylen Warren has continued to operate as Pittsburgh's primary running back in 2025, while Kenneth Gainwell has consistently served as the No. 2 option. Johnson has appeared in just four games this season, rushing 14 times for 36 yards while failing to secure his lone target. </div> <h3 id="-dk-metcalf-wr">🟢 DK Metcalf (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Metcalf found his way back into the end zone after watching his scoring streak of four games come to an end in Week 7. The five receptions tied the athletic wideout's previous high through seven games with his new club, signaling a dip in volume following his transition from Seattle to Pittsburgh this past offseason. The Steelers' No. 1 receiver currently sits at 27 receptions on 43 targets through seven starts, a pace well off the 66 receptions he recorded in each of his last two seasons as a member of the Seahawks. Metcalf has offset the decreased usage with improved red-zone prowess, matching the five touchdowns he recorded in 2024 in less than half of the games played. The total package is good enough to warrant starting consideration in the majority of fantasy formats heading into next Sunday's tilt against Indianapolis. </div> <h3 id="-christian-mccaffrey-rb">🟢 Christian McCaffrey (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> McCaffrey's fantasy outlook was a bit dimmer than usual coming in due to the quality of the Texans' defense, but the way the game unfolded made matters even more of an uphill battle. McCaffrey's carry, rushing yardage, receiving yardage and catch totals were all season lows, and nearly all his production as a receiver came on San Francisco's penultimate drive when he accrued 39 of his 43 receiving yards on a pair of receptions. Given McCaffrey's body of work prior to Sunday, the downturn could certainly be labeled an outlier that the star back should have ample opportunity to bounce back from in a favorable Week 9 road matchup against the Giants next Sunday afternoon. </div> <h3 id="-rachaad-white-rb">🟢 Rachaad White (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> White got another start in place of injured starter Bucky Irving (foot/shoulder) in Week 8, leading the Buccaneers' backfield in carries (13) and touches (15) in a comfortable win. That's where the good news ends, as backfield mate Sean Tucker (12-42-1) finished as the team's leading rusher while scoring its only touchdown on offense Sunday. With the Buccaneers on a bye in Week 9, there is a possibility that Irving could be ready to return when Tampa Bay resumes play against New England on Nov. 9. White would lose nearly all of his fantasy value in that scenario, so managers have to weigh whether it is worth holding on to the backup through the bye week. </div> <hr/> <h2 id="-lineup-analysis">📝 Lineup Analysis</h2> <h3 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h3> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_8_2025_JST_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <h3 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h3> <p><small><em>What you should have started for maximum points</em></small></p> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_8_2025_JST_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <hr/> <h2 id="-week-9-optimal-projected-lineup">🔮 Week 9 Optimal Projected Lineup</h2> <div style="padding: 15px;

</code></pre> <hr/> <h2 id="-player-report">🏥 Player Report</h2> <h3 id="-trey-mcbride-te">🟢 Trey McBride (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The fourth-year tight end hasn't missed a beat with Jacoby Brissett under center instead of Kyler Murray (foot). McBride hauled in scores of 15 yards in the second quarter and 12 yards in the third, and through two games working with Brissett, he's delivered an 18-146-3 line on 24 targets as Arizona's clear No. 1 downfield option. With the Cardinals on bye Week 8, Murray could get enough time to recover, but no matter who he's catching passes from, McBride could be poised for another impressive performance Week 9 against the Cowboys. </div> <h3 id="-chuba-hubbard-rb">🟢 Chuba Hubbard (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Hubbard notably out-touched backfield mate Rico Dowdle by a 12-8 margin on the ground, and although the latter was the more efficient of the two by far, Hubbard was the only one of the two to get into the end zone. The fifth-year pro's three-yard scoring run early in the fourth quarter marked his first time in the paint this season, and the two backs may continue working in a fairly close timeshare during a Week 9 road matchup against the Packers next Sunday afternoon. </div> <h3 id="-kyle-monangai-rb">🟢 Kyle Monangai (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Monangai has between 16 and 24 rushing yards in three of his last four contests, with an 81-yard effort and a touchdown in Week 7. His current workload keeps him a fantasy reserve unless opportunities expand. </div> <h3 id="-jamarr-chase-wr">🟢 Ja’Marr Chase (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> After setting a franchise record with 23 targets in the Week 7 win over Pittsburgh, Chase continued to see heavy volume from Joe Flacco, though a Jets secondary missing Sauce Gardner (concussion) did a surprisingly decent job of keeping Chase in check. Chase's fantasy managers won't be too disappointed with this outing, especially in PPR formats, though the Bengals will be kicking themselves for getting outscored 23-7 in the fourth quarter by a previously winless Jets team. Given how frequently Flacco looks his way, Chase has returned to the elite echelon of fantasy wide receivers ahead of a Week 9 home game versus the Bears. </div> <h3 id="-david-montgomery-rb">🟢 David Montgomery (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Jahmyr Gibbs went off for 218 yards from scrimmage and two touchdowns on Monday Night Football, leaving scraps for Montgomery's fantasy managers in Week 7. The latter still received 15 touches, highlighting his continued involvement in Detroit's two-pronged backfield. Both talented rushers have recorded a game with 100-plus yards this season, with Gibbs having the edge in total yards (+269) and touchdowns (+3). Montgomery may not be as tantalizing an asset as Gibbs, but he should continue providing flex value in fantasy when the Lions resume play Week 9. </div> <h3 id="-dalton-schultz-te">🟢 Dalton Schultz (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The veteran tight end was coming off a season-best 9-98-0 receiving line on 10 targets versus the Seahawks on Monday night, but even with top two receivers Nico Collins (concussion) and Christian Kirk (hamstring) both sidelined, he was unable to build upon that production. Schultz downturn was surprising in that context, as he finished with season lows in receptions, receiving yards and targets. Schultz will look to bounce back in Week 9 against a tough Broncos defense, and he could once again play without at least one of his two injured wide receiver teammates. </div> <h3 id="-jaylin-noel-wr">🟢 Jaylin Noel (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Noel finished tied for the team lead in receptions and for runner-up status in targets while also finishing second in receiving yards. It was the second straight productive showing in less than a week for the rookie third-round pick, who'd also produced a career-best 77 receiving yards on four catches during the Week 7 Monday night loss to the Seahawks. The absences of Nico Collins (concussion) and Christian Kirk (hamstring) have both played a part in Noel's recent surge -- Collins exited early in the fourth quarter in Seattle while Kirk has missed the last two games -- but Noel could be carving out a larger role for himself that will endure even when his veteran teammates are back in action. Noel also reclaimed his duty on special teams as a punt returner following a one-week hiatus when Braxton Berrios handled that chore. </div> <h3 id="-josh-downs-wr">🟢 Josh Downs (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Downs returned from a one-game layoff after clearing the league's concussion protocol to reclaim a starting role in Indianapolis' receiver rotation. The 23-year-old picked up where he left off when he scored his first touchdown of the season in his last appearance against the Cardinals in Week 6. Downs will attempt to hit pay dirt for the third time in as many appearances when the Colts visit the Steelers next Sunday. </div> <h3 id="-travis-etienne-jr-rb">🟢 Travis Etienne Jr. (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> While the fourth-year back was effective with his touches, Etienne got phased out of the game plan in the second half after the Jaguars fell behind 21-0 before halftime. Heading into the team's Week 8 bye, Etienne sports an impressive 594 scrimmage yards and three total TDs through seven contests. </div> <h3 id="-matthew-stafford-qb">🟢 Matthew Stafford (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Puka Nacua's (ankle) absence likely created concerns for Stafford's managers heading into Sunday's overseas tilt against an up-and-coming Jacksonville defense. The veteran signal-caller proved that no Puka was no problem, hooking up with his other superstar, wideout Davante Adams, in the end zone thrice en route to a record-setting day. Stafford's five touchdown passes set a new single-game record for the NFL's International Series, which officially started back in 2007. The 37-year-old will enter the Rams' bye week completing 67 percent of his passes for 1,866 yards and 17 touchdowns to just two interceptions in seven starts for Los Angeles. </div> <h3 id="-rhamondre-stevenson-rb">🟢 Rhamondre Stevenson (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The fifth-year back saw rookie TreVeyon Henderson gain 75 yards on just 10 totes, while Stevenson struggled to 2.4 yards per carry. The veteran has managed to hang onto the top spot in New England's backfield time share so far this season, but Henderson's explosiveness may be tipping the scales in his favor. That said, Stevenson had three rushing TDs over the prior three games, and he likely won't disappear from the offense completely even if Henderson takes the lead role in Week 9 against the Falcons. </div> <h3 id="-spencer-rattler-qb">🟢 Spencer Rattler (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Rattler was benched for rookie second-rounder Tyler Shough late in the third quarter of New Orleans' 23-3 loss to the Buccaneers in Week 8, though neither signal-caller had much success moving the ball on offense. Moore will likely want to give whomever of Rattler or Shough will start Sunday against Los Angeles a full week of practice, so a decision on the team's No. 1 quarterback for Week 9 likely will arrive prior to Wednesday. Neither boasts much fantasy appeal, especially in single-QB formats. </div> <h3 id="-aj-brown-wr">🟢 A.J. Brown (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Out<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> out </div> <h3 id="-cooper-kupp-wr">🟢 Cooper Kupp (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Seahawks tried to get cute in the second quarter with a wide receiver pass play that resulted in an interception for Kupp. Depending on league settings, the veteran wideout's rare turnover may have erased more than half of his fantasy production Monday. Only getting one target is the more concerning takeaway after Kupp scored his first touchdown as a member of the Seahawks in Week 6. The 32-year-old will carry a 24-293-1 receiving line into Seattle's upcoming bye week before resuming play against the Commanders on Nov. 2. </div> <hr/> <h2 id="-lineup-analysis">📝 Lineup Analysis</h2> <h3 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h3> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_8_2025_RRT_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <h3 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h3> <p><small><em>What you should have started for maximum points</em></small></p> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_8_2025_RRT_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <hr/> <h2 id="-week-9-optimal-projected-lineup">🔮 Week 9 Optimal Projected Lineup</h2> <div style="padding: 15px; background-color: #e7f3ff; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;"> <strong>Next Opponent:</strong> Emma's Excellent Team<br/> <strong>Total Projected Points:</strong> 143.70<br/> </div> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_9_2025_RRT_projected.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> <th data-field="opponent" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="false">Opponent</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <hr/> <h2 id="-remaining-schedule-analysis">📅 Remaining Schedule Analysis</h2> <div style="padding: 15px; background-color: #fff3cd; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;"> <strong>⚠️ Average Opponent Strength:</strong> 115.64 PPG </div> <table class="table table-sm table-hover"> <thead><tr> <th>Opponent</th><th>Record</th><th>Avg Points</th> </tr></thead> <tbody> <tr><td><strong>Emma's Excellent Team</strong></td><td>1-7</td><td>84.69</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>To Infinity and Bijan!</strong></td><td>3-5</td><td>106.28</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>Mcconky Donkeys</strong></td><td>4-4</td><td>108.62</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>Third Time's the Charm?</strong></td><td>7-1</td><td>131.12</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>90s MonCon</strong></td><td>3-5</td><td>128.07</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>Mama Daughter Duo</strong></td><td>4-4</td><td>135.07</td></tr> </tbody></table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week8"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry></feed>
