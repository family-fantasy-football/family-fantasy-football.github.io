</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="lamar-jackson-qb">Lamar Jackson (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> A Browns defense that has traditionally given Jackson some trouble wasn’t able to quite contain him as it had in the past, particularly during a second half in which Baltimore’s offense compiled 24 points overall. Jackson contributed directly to 21 of those points with touchdown passes of two and 24 yards to Devontez Walker and a 23-yard scoring strike to DeAndre Hopkins. That trio of TD tosses was preceded by a 15-yard connection with Tylan Wallace in the second quarter, giving Jackson his first tally of at least three scoring passes since Week 15 of last season. Jackson has opened 2025 with a 6:0 TD:INT and next faces a Lions team coming off a rout of the Bears in a Week 3 interconference home showdown on Monday night, Sept. 22.</p> <h4 id="joe-flacco-qb">Joe Flacco (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Flacco’s underwhelming line tells the tale of a sluggish afternoon for the Browns’ offense, one during which he took two sacks in addition to his two turnovers. Flacco spread the ball around well but was outmanned by an aggressive Ravens defense and an efficient, mistake-free performance by Lamar Jackson. Flacco was replaced by rookie Dillon Gabriel for the final drive – which did result in a touchdown – but Matt Schneidman of The Athletic reports head coach Kevin Stefanski confirmed Flacco would remain the starter for a Week 3 home matchup against the Packers.</p> <h4 id="quinshon-judkins-rb">Quinshon Judkins (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Although Judkins was reportedly ticketed for a modest role in his delayed NFL debut, the rookie ended up leading the Browns in rush attempts and rushing yards on the afternoon. Just over half of Judkins’ rushing production came on a 31-yard run, but considering the quality of the defense he was facing and the fact he missed all of training camp and preseason, his performance can’t be labeled as anything but encouraging. With Judkins displaying the conditioning to handle double-digit touches right out of the gate, it’s possible he paces the ground attack again in a Week 3 home matchup against the Packers next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="jameson-williams-wr">Jameson Williams (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Williams was on his way to a second consecutive lackluster game to open the season before he turned on the jets for a 44-yard touchdown reception just past the halfway point of the third quarter. Williams saw his Week 1 catch total cut in half, but his yardage got an 85-yard boost and vaulted him to his first 100-yard effort since Week 16 of last season. Williams will try to break through against the Ravens’ secondary in a Week 3 road matchup in Baltimore on Monday night, Sept. 22.</p> <h4 id="nico-collins-wr">Nico Collins (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Quarterback C.J. Stroud wasted no time finding his favorite target in the end zone Monday when he floated a rainbow in to Collins on the Texans’ first possession of the game. The athletic receiver made a near-impossible grab where he managed to keep both of his feet in bounds for a millisecond before the momentum of the pass carried him out of the end zone. It wasn’t all roses for Collins, as he finished the contest with an abysmal 33 percent catch rate on a team-high nine targets. The end result was still a significant improvement over the star wideout’s Week 1 stinker. Collins’ next opportunity to put up the consistent WR1 numbers managers have become accustomed to from him will be in a road matchup against the Jaguars on Sunday.</p> <h4 id="jonathan-taylor-rb">Jonathan Taylor (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Taylor delivered a key run of 68 yards early in the fourth quarter to set up a field goal for the Colts while also accounting for the team’s longest play from scrimmage. He was efficient on the ground beyond that single carry, logging a pair of both 10 and nine-yard gains. Taylor also got involved as a pass catcher, taking a swing pass for 43 yards late in the first quarter before catching a touchdown on a similar play from seven yards away one quarter later. It was an excellent performance all around and marked the sixth time in Taylor’s career that he’s topped 200 yards from scrimmage.</p> <h4 id="brock-bowers-te">Brock Bowers (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Bowers was able to suit up after injuring his knee Week 1 and being limited to just one practice Saturday. The budding superstar wore a bulky brace on his left knee but otherwise was unaffected by the injury that threatened his status for Monday’s primetime matchup. Bowers’ pedestrian stat line was the result of a horrid passing night from QB Geno Smith, who completed just 55 percent of his pass attempts while throwing three interceptions. With the injury scare behind him, Bowers and the entire Las Vegas offense will look to right the ship in a road tilt against the Commanders on Sunday.</p> <h4 id="jaylen-waddle-wr">Jaylen Waddle (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Waddle navigated a shoulder issue throughout the practice week but entered Sunday without an injury designation, and he put up a solid performance overall that saw him finish third in receptions, receiving yards and targets for the Dolphins on the afternoon. The 2021 first-round pick also recorded his first touchdown of the campaign on an 18-yard grab early in the second quarter, and he enjoyed an appreciable boost over his 30-yard effort in Week 1 against the Colts. Waddle and the increasingly desperate Dolphins will have to face the Bills on a short week when the two division rivals clash on Thursday night to kick off Week 3.</p> <h4 id="tua-tagovailoa-qb">Tua Tagovailoa (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Tagovailoa and the Dolphins’ offense as a whole were in dire straits over the first quarter-plus as the Patriots raced out to a 12-0 lead. Matters took a turn for the better in the second quarter when Tagovailoa hit Jaylen Waddle and De’Von Achane for touchdown passes of 18 and 29 yards, respectively. However, although Tagovailoa was able to compile some yardage in the second half, he wasn’t able to lead Miami to anything other than a pair of field goals, as the Dolphins’ other second-half points came from a Malik Washington 74-yard punt return touchdown. The Dolphins already have their backs against the wall at 0-2, making Thursday night’s Week 3 road matchup against the Bills a critical early-season game for Tagovailoa and his teammates.</p> <h4 id="jordan-mason-rb">Jordan Mason (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Coach Kevin O’Connell relayed the news regarding Jones on Monday, and the situation should gain clarity once the Vikings are required to post Week 3 injury reports, starting Wednesday. In any case, Mason already had a leg up on Jones through two games this season, handling 24 carries for 98 yards and gathering in three of four targets for 15 yards, while Jones notched 13 carries for 46 yards and three catches (on four targets) for 44 yards and one touchdown. Assuming Jones is out this weekend, most of his touches will be gobbled up by Mason.</p> <h4 id="garrett-wilson-wr">Garrett Wilson (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Wilson was the only player to exceed nine receiving yards for the Jets in the ugly Week 2 loss. He’s the clear top target in a Jets passing attack that could be orchestrated by Tyrod Taylor in Week 3 against the Buccaneers after Justin Fields sustained a concussion in the fourth quarter of Sunday’s defeat. Wilson had three catches for 33 yards in Taylor’s two drives following Fields’ injury.</p> <h4 id="calvin-austin-iii-wr">Calvin Austin III (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Austin looked like he was starting a breakout season after a strong Week 1 showing, but his performance took a significant dip in Week 2. Beyond the lackluster stat line, he ran the wrong route in the end zone late in the third quarter, with the ball ultimately being picked by Seattle. Austin is likely to continue to earn snaps, but his production will also remain inconsistent.</p> <h4 id="jaylen-warren-rb">Jaylen Warren (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Warren more explicitly accounted for the majority of touches out of Pittsburgh’s backfield relative to Week 1, out-touching Kenneth Gainwell 18-8. Warren found very little running room, but he made an impact as a receiver for the second consecutive week. Warren recorded a 65-yard gain, most of which came after the catch, in the middle of the third quarter, during which he bounced off several would-be tacklers before being taken down at the five-yard line. While Warren hasn’t had a strong start to the season on the ground, he has six receptions for 108 yards and a touchdown combined across the two contests.</p> <h4 id="jauan-jennings-wr">Jauan Jennings (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Per Nick Wagoner of ESPN.com, Jennings is viewed as day-to-day as this weekend’s game against the Cardinals approaches. In Sunday’s 26-21 win over the Saints, Jennings parlayed his 87 percent snap share into 5-89-1 line on a team-high 10 targets.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_2_2025_90s_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_2_2025_90s_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week2"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Abbey’s TNT Team Week 2 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-2-ARV/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Abbey’s TNT Team Week 2 Report"/><published>2025-09-16T15:11:24+00:00</published><updated>2025-09-16T15:11:24+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-2-ARV</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-2-ARV/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Abbey’s TNT Team 🧨 Lost against Game of Zones - House Hamlin 113.09-119.75<br/> Current Standing: #8<br/> Playoff Chances: 58.7%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 84.6%<br/> Best Performer: Bo Nix (29.24 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="bijan-robinson-rb">Bijan Robinson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Robinson got off to a quick start to the game, with his first two carries combining to go for 42 yards. He chipped in additional long gains of 18 and 11 yards in the third quarter to ultimately average 6.5 yards per attempt. The only thing missing from Robinson’s performance was a trip to the end zone, as Tyler Allgeier instead got that opportunity late in the third quarter. Robinson topped 100 yards from scrimmage for the second consecutive game and rebounded on the ground after gaining only 24 yards as a rusher in Week 1.</p> <h4 id="xavier-legette-wr">Xavier Legette (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The second-year wideout has managed just four receptions for eight yards through two games this season, a concerning start considering the Panthers attempted 90 passes over that span. However, there’s still reason for optimism regarding Legette’s season-long fantasy output, as his 15 targets tie Hunter Renfrow for the second-most on the team. Legette will look to turn that volume into production in a divisional matchup against the Falcons in Week 3.</p> <h4 id="colston-loveland-te">Colston Loveland (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Afte catching both of his targets against Minnesota in the season opener, Loveland was shut out on one target against the Lions. The rookie has seen half of the targets that fellow tight end Cole Kmet has. Loveland may work his way into an expanded role, but he’s currently a risky fantasy option.</p> <h4 id="dylan-sampson-rb">Dylan Sampson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Sampson had led the Browns’ ground attack with 12 carries and had garnered 20 total touches in Week 1, but the debut of fellow rookie Quinshon Judkins in Sunday’s loss altered the backfield hierarchy. Judkins ultimately recorded a game-high 10 rush attempts, but Sampson still found a way to make an impact by recording an eight-yard touchdown reception from another member of the team’s 2025 draft class, Dillon Gabriel. With Judkins’ workload a virtual lock to go up from this point forward, Sampson will likely be looking to displace veteran Jerome Ford for the No. 2 role.</p> <h4 id="jaydon-blue-rb">Jaydon Blue (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The rookie fifth-round draft pick will have to wait at least one more week to make his NFL debut, as Dallas will proceed with Javonte Williams and Miles Sanders as its lone active running backs for the second straight game. Though Williams looks to be locked in as Dallas’ lead back after producing two touchdowns and 64 total yards on 17 touches in the Week 1 loss to the Eagles, Blue could eventually unseat Sanders – who committed a costly fumble in the opener – for the No. 2 role as the season unfolds.</p> <h4 id="bo-nix-qb">Bo Nix (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Nix and the Broncos’ offense began the game in exceptional form, as he threw for three touchdowns on the team’s first four offensive possessions. His most impressive was a 23-yard dart to the back corner of the end zone to Marvin Mims, and Nix also connected with Troy Franklin for a 42-yard gain early in the second quarter. Things changed in the second half, however, as his explosive plays were eliminated, and he also threw a key interception early in the fourth quarter to aid the Colts’ comeback efforts. Nix’s fantasy performance was solid, but he now has three interceptions and a fumble lost in the first two games of the new campaign.</p> <h4 id="kalif-raymond-wr">Kalif Raymond (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Raymond once again was quiet Week 2, playing just 32 offensive snaps in Detroit’s dominant victory. The wide receiver snagged his only catch of the day on the team’s third possession of the contest, but he did garner 15 more offensive snaps than rookie Isaac TeSlaa, so Raymond does still appear to be the No. 3 option at his position behind Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jameson Williams. With many mouths to feed on offense in Detroit, Raymond doesn’t offer much weekly upside for fantasy managers, and his greatest impact for the team comes as a punt returner.</p> <h4 id="geno-smith-qb">Geno Smith (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> This outing was doomed from the get go when Smith threw the first of three interceptions on the first play from scrimmage. The 34-year-old had no answers after netting just 45 yards of offense through the first half of action Monday. This putrid showing comes on the heels of Smith airing it out for 362 yards in a Week 1 win over the Patriots, highlighting the peaks and valleys that come with a quarterback who threw 21 TDs to 15 INTs with Seattle last season. The Raiders will be counting on a bounce-back performance from its veteran signal-caller in a softer matchup against Washington in Week 3.</p> <h4 id="kyren-williams-rb">Kyren Williams (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Williams dominated touches out of the Rams’ backfield for the most of the game, but he was inefficient once again. He delivered 12- and 15-yard rushes late in the fourth quarter to salvage his day, but that came one drive after he ceded a possession to Blake Corum that concluded with Corum in the end zone. Corum’s opportunity was likely due to the Rams being up two scores midway through the fourth quarter, but Williams’ usage in the red zone will remain worth monitoring.</p> <h4 id="puka-nacua-wr">Puka Nacua (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Nacua made an impact in both conventional and unconventional fashion in Sunday’s win. He kicked things off with a 45-yard rushing score early in the first quarter on an end around. Nacua then went on to add long receptions of 24 and 22 yards to cap off an excellent all-around fantasy performance. Through two games, he has 266 yards from scrimmage and 18 receptions.</p> <h4 id="tyreek-hill-wr">Tyreek Hill (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Hill set the pace for the Dolphins in receiving yards while checking in second in receptions and targets. Hill’s day could have been even bigger had Tua Tagovailoa not missed him when he was wide open on a second-half pass, but the fact the talented wideout put together his first 100-yard effort of the campaign was certainly a bright spot during a loss that dropped the Dolphins to 0-2. With Miami desperate for a win, Hill figures to be prominently featured again in a Thursday night Week 3 road matchup against the Bills that is arguably already a critical game for the Dolphins.</p> <h4 id="tank-bigsby-rb">Tank Bigsby (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Acquired from the Jaguars for a fifth- and sixth-round draft pick at the start of the week, Bigsby was not yet part of the Eagles’ offensive gameplan. His only snaps came on special teams. He’ll compete with Will Shipley (ribs) and AJ Dillon for the backup role behind Saquon Barkley once he’s more integrated with his new team.</p> <h4 id="emeka-egbuka-wr">Emeka Egbuka (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The rookie first-round pick had a relatively quiet latter portion of the game, but not before making his mark with what was already his third trip to the end zone through two NFL games. Egbuka scored on a nifty 15-yard catch and run in the second quarter, a play that accounted for more than half of his receiving yardage on the night. The Texans, like the Falcons in Week 1, generally did a good job keeping plays in front of them, but Egbuka could benefit from the heavy attention Sauce Gardner is likely to bestow on Mike Evans in a Week 3 home matchup against the Jets on Sunday afternoon.</p> <h4 id="calvin-ridley-wr">Calvin Ridley (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Ridley tied for the team lead in targets with both Elic Ayomanor and Chig Okonkwo, though he beat out Ayomanor by one yard to lead Tennessee pass catchers. Ridley’s longest catch of the day went for 26 yards, when Cam Ward rolled out to his right and hit him along the sideline. It was an improved performance for Ridley, though Ayomanor is emerging as a key part of the offense and looks likely to continue to cut into Ridley’s opportunities.</p> <h4 id="deebo-samuel-wr">Deebo Samuel (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Commanders’ air attack was mostly stuck in neutral for a significant portion of the night, but Samuel was able to offer some solace to fantasy managers by recording 12- and 10-yard grabs on Washington’s final scoring drive. The latter play also resulted in Samuel’s second touchdown in as many games in a Commanders uniform, and he’s now encouragingly logged 18 targets through his first two games with Jayden Daniels. Samuel next takes aim at the Raiders defense in a Week 3 home matchup on Sunday, Sept. 21.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_2_2025_ARV_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_2_2025_ARV_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week2"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Big Titi Energy Week 2 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-2-BTE/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Big Titi Energy Week 2 Report"/><published>2025-09-16T15:11:24+00:00</published><updated>2025-09-16T15:11:24+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-2-BTE</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-2-BTE/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Big Titi Energy Lost against Rookie Mistake 69.10-125.20<br/> Current Standing: #12<br/> Playoff Chances: 12.4%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 76.5%<br/> Best Performer: Kenneth Walker III (18.30 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="dalton-kincaid-te">Dalton Kincaid (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Kincaid led the Bills in targets and receiving yards as the passing attack took a back seat to the running game, which produced 224 yards and three touchdowns. The 2023 first-round pick has opened his third NFL campaign with a pair of four-catch performances and should remain involved in Thursday’s Week 3 home game against the Dolphins.</p> <h4 id="dj-moore-wr">DJ Moore (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Moore was a distant second in receiving yards and targets to Rome Odunze while finishing as the runner-up in receptions as well. As such, Moore took a clear back seat to Odunze in the air attack for at least this week, but the pecking order Sunday could indeed be a harbinger of what’s to come as the season unfolds. Moore does have an 8-114-0 receiving line on 11 targets through two games heading into a Week 3 home matchup against the Cowboys next Sunday afternoon.</p> <h4 id="roschon-johnson-rb">Roschon Johnson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Johnson missed the regular-season opener due to a foot injury, which allowed rookie Kyle Monangai to operate as the backup behind D’Andre Swift. Johnson returned to practice during Week 2 prep and didn’t have an injury designation heading into Sunday, so he should be full-go against Detroit. However, Swift handled 81 percent of the offensive snaps against Minnesota, so there may not be many opportunities to go around, especially if Monangai remains part of the mix.</p> <h4 id="tee-higgins-wr">Tee Higgins (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Higgins bounced back from a poor Week 1 performance, thanks primarily to a long 42-yard touchdown late in the third quarter. That pass was delivered by Jake Browning after Joe Burrow departed with a toe injury, and it was Higgins’ only catch on five targets that he was able to haul in from Browning. If Burrow is set to miss additional time, Higgins could become a boom or bust fantasy option with Ja’Marr Chase continuing to dominate targets in the Cincinnati offense.</p> <h4 id="jerome-ford-rb">Jerome Ford (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Although debuting rookie Quinshon Judkins paced the ground attack with 10 rush attempts, Ford still logged two more carries than Dylan Sampson, who’d garnered more work than the veteran in Week 1. Ford also tied Harold Fannin for the team lead in receptions, and he filled the role of primary kickoff returner. Judkins’ role figures to only grow moving forward, however, so how long Ford can remain truly relevant in the offense of a non-contending team while also navigating Sampson’s presence remains to be seen.</p> <h4 id="christian-kirk-wr">Christian Kirk (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable</p> <h4 id="cj-stroud-qb">C.J. Stroud (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Stroud didn’t waste much time scoring the Texans’ first touchdown of the season after failing to get his team into the end zone against the Rams in Week 1. The 24-year-old dialed up WR Nico Collins for a 27-yard score on Houston’s opening drive, but that would end up being his only touchdown of the contest. Stroud failed to capitalize on a golden opportunity on the opponent’s one-yard line early in the fourth quarter when he missed on two consecutive throws to turn the ball over on downs. With marginal yardage totals (197.5 passing yards per game) and just one touchdown to one interception through two starts, Stroud has played his way out of starting consideration in standard 1QB formats ahead of Sunday’s tilt against Jacksonville.</p> <h4 id="tre-tucker-wr">Tre Tucker (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Tucker was one of four Raiders to average more than 20.0 yards per reception during quarterback Geno Smith’s first game with Las Vegas on Sunday, and Tucker’s performance was highlighted by a 26-yard touchdown catch on the opening possession. Working as the WR2 behind Jakobi Meyers with Amari Cooper electing to retire just before the start of the season, Tucker ultimately played 57 of a possible 63 offensive snaps. Additional targets could be up for grabs if tight end Brock Bowers (knee) were to miss any time.</p> <h4 id="jj-mccarthy-qb">J.J. McCarthy (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Not long after coach Kevin O’Connell revealed Monday that McCarthy showed up to team facilities with a sore ankle that was deemed a sprain, Rapoport and Tom Pelissero of NFL Network are reporting that the injury may require some time on the sideline. McCarthy didn’t fare well in Week 2, completing 11 of 21 passes for 158 yards, no touchdowns and two interceptions, turning five carries into 25 yards and losing one of his three fumbles. O’Connell also told Alec Lewis of The Athletic that Minnesota will get backup QB Carson Wentz ready for Sunday’s game against the Bengals in the event McCarthy eventually is inactive.</p> <h4 id="demario-douglas-wr">DeMario Douglas (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> With the Patriots rolling with their share of multi-TE groupings in Week 2, in addition to the team mixing which WRs were on the field in three-WR alignments, Douglas saw a dip in playing time Sunday. Looking ahead, game plans and game flows in the coming weeks could lead to added opportunities for Douglas, but with a 3-6-1 receiving line (on eight targets) through two games, the Patriots’ slot man profiles as a hit-or-miss option in PPR formats.</p> <h4 id="juwan-johnson-te">Juwan Johnson (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> For the second straight game Johnson saw impressive volume, finishing second on the Saints in targets behind Chris Olave’s 10, and this time the tight end was able to turn one of them into a score as he caught an 18-yard strike from Spencer Rattler inside the final two minutes of the first half. Johnson saw only 66 targets in 17 regular-season games in 2024, but he’s already gotten 21 in the first two games of the current campaign, leading to a 13-125-1 line. He could be headed for another big effort in Week 3 against a Seahawks defense that gave up two TDs to San Francisco TEs – George Kittle (hamstring) and Jake Tonges – in its opener before allowing a combined 7-58-0 line on eight targets to Steelers tight ends Jonnu Smith and Pat Freiermuth in Week 2.</p> <h4 id="breece-hall-rb">Breece Hall (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Hall finished second on the team in both rushing yards and receiving yards, as Garrett Wilson (50) was the only Jet to reach double digits in the latter category. Justin Fields couldn’t get anything going through the air prior to sustaining a concussion in the fourth quarter, and the lack of any passing threat made it hard for Hall to find any holes against a front-loaded Bills defense. Backup Braelon Allen handled just two carries, so at least Hall’s locked in as the lead back heading into a Week 3 trip to Tampa Bay.</p> <h4 id="dallas-goedert-te">Dallas Goedert (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable</p> <h4 id="zach-charbonnet-rb">Zach Charbonnet (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Charbonnet was outplayed by Kenneth Walker, who turned 14 touches into 118 scrimmage yards and a touchdown. The 2022 and 2023 second-round draft picks have been deployed in a near-even split to begin the 2025 campaign. Seattle will likely continue to ride the hot hand in Week 3 against the Saints, though the workload could start to shift away from Charbonnet if Walker continues to outplay him.</p> <h4 id="kenneth-walker-iii-rb">Kenneth Walker III (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Walker was far more effective than Zach Charbonnet, who had just 10 rushing yards on 15 carries. The former put an exclamation point on the win by breaking free for a 19-yard touchdown run with 3:41 left in the fourth quarter. Walker had just 24 scrimmage yards and was outplayed by Charbonnet in Seattle’s Week 1 loss to the 49ers, so they will likely continue to operate in a timeshare in Week 3 against the Saints, though the workload distribution could start to tilt in Walker’s favor after his strong Week 2 performance.</p> <h4 id="terry-mclaurin-wr">Terry McLaurin (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> McLaurin finished third in receptions and second in receiving yards on the Commanders for the night, while also setting the pace in targets. As a whole, his collection of numbers certainly represented a nice boost from his 2-27-0 line on four targets Week 1 against the Giants, but through two games, the Commanders’ passing game has been relatively conservative. McLaurin and Jayden Daniels will have some extra time to reestablish chemistry ahead of a Week 3 home matchup against the Raiders on Sunday, Sept. 21.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_2_2025_BTE_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_2_2025_BTE_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week2"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Emma’s Excellent Team Week 2 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-2-EET/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Emma’s Excellent Team Week 2 Report"/><published>2025-09-16T15:11:24+00:00</published><updated>2025-09-16T15:11:24+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-2-EET</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-2-EET/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Emma’s Excellent Team Lost against Fantasy Guru Kayden 67.94-99.40<br/> Current Standing: #11<br/> Playoff Chances: 27.5%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 78.3%<br/> Best Performer: Trevor Lawrence (19.24 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="trey-benson-rb">Trey Benson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Benson fell back to No. 2 in the RB pecking order Sunday after leading the team in rushing with 69 yards in Week 1. The Florida State product finished with eight fewer carries than starter James Conner (11-34-1), with the former making the bigger impact in the passing game. Conner is still the lead back and preferred fantasy option in Arizona, but Benson has carved out a nice role heading into next Sunday’s tilt versus the 49ers.</p> <h4 id="drake-london-wr">Drake London (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Falcons relied on a run-heavy offense as they never trailed in the contest, limiting the production of all their pass catchers. Nevertheless, London led the team in yardage thanks to a long gain of 21 yards, though he also lost a fumble after an 18-yard gain early in the first quarter. He has only 104 yards on 19 targets through two games this season, and Atlanta may be able to rely heavily on their run game once again in Week 3 against Carolina.</p> <h4 id="justice-hill-rb">Justice Hill (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Baltimore’s run game was uncharacteristically shut down by the Browns on Sunday as Hill and Derrick Henry combined for 14 carries and 30 yards. Hill managed to contribute in the passing game with three grabs after being held to just one three-yard reception in the opener. His playing time remained in line with his Week 1 total as he played 22 snaps. His usage can vary week-to-week, but Hill’s snap share sits in the 40 percent range.</p> <h4 id="joshua-palmer-wr">Joshua Palmer (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Most of Palmer’s production came on a 32-yard reception from Mitchell Trubisky, who came in for a pair of plays in the first quarter as Josh Allen tended to a nosebleed and again for mop-up duty down the stretch. Despite taking a step back from his five-catch, 61-yard Bills debut, Palmer led the team in receiving yards in Week 2, as Buffalo went with a much more run-heavy approach. Palmer has established himself as a top-three wide receiver on the team alongside Keon Coleman and Khalil Shakir heading into Thursday’s home game against the Dolphins.</p> <h4 id="courtland-sutton-wr">Courtland Sutton (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Bo Nix spread targets among the Denver pass catchers very evenly, with nine players targeted at least twice in the contest. While that was one factor in limiting Sutton’s involvement, Troy Franklin also commanded nine targets to lead the team. It seems unlikely that Franklin will truly challenge Sutton for opportunities moving forward, but this was nevertheless a concerning performance for the latter.</p> <h4 id="trevor-lawrence-qb">Trevor Lawrence (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Lawrence had the Jaguars in position for a win until the Bengals managed to rally behind Jake Browning on a 15-play, 92-yard touchdown drive. Lawrence put together an impressive performance overall that included touchdown passes to Dyami Brown (nine yards), Bhayshul Tuten (eight yards) and Travis Etienne (11 yards), but he also short-circuited two Jacksonville drives in the first half with interceptions at the Bengals’ three-yard line and his own 34-yard line. The two plays would help lead to a combined 10 points for Cincinnati, certainly key developments in such a close game. Lawrence also continued to struggle in his connection with No. 1 receiver Brian Thomas (four catches on 12 targets), and the duo will encounter a tough defensive matchup in a Week 3 home date against the Texans next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="hollywood-brown-wr">Hollywood Brown (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Brown saw his target volume fall back down to earth following last week’s 16-target, 10-catch outburst. The veteran wideout still led the Chiefs in receptions, with his five targets being usurped by only Travis Kelce’s six in an overall lackluster passing performance Sunday. Brown could see his target share cut into if Xavier Worthy (shoulder) continues trending towards playing in Week 3. That said, Hollywood should stick in the starting lineup at least until Rashee Rice (suspension) returns in Week 7. Brown remains a plus PPR play when the Chiefs visit the Giants next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="jakobi-meyers-wr">Jakobi Meyers (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Meyers paced Las Vegas in targets, receptions and receiving yards despite finishing with a poor catch rate (50 percent). The 28-year-old has garnered double-digit targets in both appearances with new QB Geno Smith this season, cementing the wideout’s spot atop the Raiders’ depth chart. Meyers’ predictable volume makes him a reliable starting option heading into Sunday’s tilt against the Commanders, offering a notable boost in value for those in PPR formats.</p> <h4 id="darren-waller-te">Darren Waller (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Waller, who has been out for the first two games of the season, had been deemed a non-participant in all of the Dolphins’ practices leading up to Monday’s estimate. Either way, the tight end’s status for Thursday night’s game against the Bills remains uncertain, with added context in that regard set to arrive via his participation level in Tuesday’s session.</p> <h4 id="aaron-jones-sr-rb">Aaron Jones Sr. (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Jones made an early exit from Sunday’s 22-6 loss to the Falcons due to a hamstring injury, but even before then he was in a relative timeshare with Jordan Mason. Overall, Jones tallied 23 yards on five carries and didn’t haul in his only target on 20 offensive snaps, while Mason had nine carries for 30 yards and two catches (on three targets) for eight yards on 28 plays. If Jones ends up sitting out Week 3, Mason likely would take on the bulk of Minnesota’s backfield reps, while Zavier Scott would be a candidate to mix in as well.</p> <h4 id="rashid-shaheed-wr">Rashid Shaheed (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The fourth-year wideout was on the other end of Spencer Rattler’s second of three TD passes on the day, a three-yard strike in the third quarter. Shaheed has had a respectable start to the season in new head coach Kellen Moore’s scheme, posting a 10-85-1 line on 14 targets through two games as the WR2 behind Chris Olave. Shaheed will look to build on this performance in Week 3 against the Seahawks.</p> <h4 id="saquon-barkley-rb">Saquon Barkley (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Barkley set the tone on offense for Philadelphia by scoring the game’s first touchdown in a rematch of Super Bowl LIX. The 28-year-old superstar went on to average 4.0 yards per tote while leading his club in yards from scrimmage (94). The recent trade for RB Tank Bigsby didn’t affect Barkley’s workload, as the only other rusher to record any carries was veteran backup AJ Dillon (3-19-0). Barkley will look to extend a modest two-game scoring streak to open the season when the Eagles host the Rams next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="brock-purdy-qb">Brock Purdy (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Out <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> out</p> <h4 id="tony-pollard-rb">Tony Pollard (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Pollard was the only Titans running back to record a touch in Sunday’s game and was fairly efficient given the team’s poor offensive showing. His biggest gains came on a pair of 10-yard runs on back-to-back possessions just before halftime. Pollard should continue to see a very high workload so long as Tyjae Spears (ankle) remains sidelined, though his touchdown upside is limited until Cam Ward can get the offense moving more consistently.</p> <h4 id="zach-ertz-te">Zach Ertz (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Ertz set the pace in receiving yards for the Commanders while finishing as the runner-up in receptions and also tying for second in targets. The veteran tight end also recorded his second TD of the season on an impressive 20-yard catch-and-run early in the fourth quarter, making it an all-around rewarding fantasy performance despite the disappointing team outcome. With 13 target through two games, Ertz looks to be just as in sync with Jayden Daniels as he was in the latter’s rookie 2024 campaign, and the duo next will turn their sights to the Raiders defense in a Week 3 home matchup on Sunday, Sept. 21.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_2_2025_EET_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_2_2025_EET_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week2"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Mama Daughter Duo Week 2 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-2-JST/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mama Daughter Duo Week 2 Report"/><published>2025-09-16T15:11:24+00:00</published><updated>2025-09-16T15:11:24+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-2-JST</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-2-JST/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Mama Daughter Duo Lost against Michael’s Managable Team 126.22-141.03<br/> Current Standing: #5<br/> Playoff Chances: 47.3%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 93.4%<br/> Best Performer: Rome Odunze (28.30 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="michael-penix-jr-qb">Michael Penix Jr. (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Falcons played from ahead for the entire game, and the team was happy to rely on its running game. That limited Penix’s pass attempts, though he wasn’t all that efficient with his opportunity, averaging only 6.43 yards per attempt while primarily targeting short areas of the field. Atlanta may be able to control their Week 3 matchup against Carolina in similar fashion, which could lead to another quiet performance from Penix.</p> <h4 id="caleb-williams-qb">Caleb Williams (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Williams’ final line was serviceable, but the final score underscores how dominant the Lions were overall. The 2024 first overall pick looked especially impressive in the first half while connecting with Rome Odunze for touchdown passes of 28 and six yards, but he helped lead the Bears to only seven second-half points. Williams connected with seven different targets in his second game in head coach Ben Johnson’s offense, and he clearly remains a work in progress in the quarterback-friendly system heading into a Week 3 home matchup against the Cowboys next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="rome-odunze-wr">Rome Odunze (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Odunze, in conjunction with Caleb Williams, single-handedly kept the Bears competitive in the first quarter, recording 28- and six-yard touchdown grabs in the first and second quarter, respectively. Odunze easily led the Bears in receptions, receiving yards and targets on the afternoon, and although his career-best day was sullied by the sizable loss, it was certainly encouraging to see the emphasis on getting the second-year wideout involved in Ben Johnson’s offense. Odunze next takes aim at a Cowboys secondary that allowed 450 passing yards and three touchdowns to the Giants’ Russell Wilson, as Dallas comes into the Windy City for a Week 3 showdown next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="dandre-swift-rb">D’Andre Swift (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Swift was able to serve as a bright spot for the Bears’ offense on a mostly forgettable afternoon, putting together an efficient performance on the ground that included a three-yard touchdown run early in the fourth quarter. However, Swift also short-circuited what appeared to be a scoring drive when he lost a fumble at the Lions’ 31-yard line late in the first quarter. Through two games, Swift remains the clear No. 1 back in Chicago’s ground attack, and he’ll have a favorable matchup at home against the Cowboys in a Week 3 showdown next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="jayden-reed-wr">Jayden Reed (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Out <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Rapoport previously reported Friday that Reed will undergo surgery next week to address the injury, and the estimated 6-to-8-week recovery timeline will keep him out through early-to-mid-November. The Packers will likely place Reed on injured reserve in the coming days to open up a spot on the 53-man roster. While Reed is sidelined, the Packers should have extra snaps available for all of the remaining members of their deep rotation of receivers (Matthew Golden, Romeo Doubs, Dontayvion Wicks, Savion Williams and Malik Heath). Through Green Bay’s first two games, Doubs is the only Packers receiver to play more than 70 percent of snaps (71 percent Week 1, 74 percent Week 2).</p> <h4 id="travis-kelce-te">Travis Kelce (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Kelce led all Kansas City receivers in targets (six) and receiving yards (61), but he was unable to replicate the trip to the end zone that he secured for fantasy managers last week. The 35-year-old did fare better against the Eagles this time around after being held to 39 yards with no touchdowns when these two teams met in Super Bowl LIX this past February. With a thin receiver room due to absences from Rashee Rice (suspension) and Xavier Worthy (shoulder), Kelce remains a focal point on offense for a team struggling out of the gates. The Chiefs will attempt to secure their first win of the season in a road matchup against the Giants next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="hunter-henry-te">Hunter Henry (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Fellow tight end Austin Hooper logged 37 snaps and caught all three of his targets for 38 yards. Given that Henry – who caught four of eight targets for 66 yards in Week 1 – was on the field for nearly every play Sunday, he’ll have an opportunity to make a fantasy contribution most weeks, but the Patriots’ upgraded WR room gives Drake Maye more options in the passing game than he had in 2024, when the veteran TE posted career highs in catches (66), targets (97) and yards (674).</p> <h4 id="chris-olave-wr">Chris Olave (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The fourth-year wideout led the Saints in volume once again while seeing double-digit targets from Spencer Rattler for the second straight game. Olave is still looking for his first TD, and his first breakout performance, of 2025, but his usage in new head coach Kellen Moore’s scheme suggests both will come in due time. Olave will take on a Seahawks secondary in Week 3 that has been stingy so far against WRs, but which did give up a TD to DK Metcalf in Week 2.</p> <h4 id="will-shipley-rb">Will Shipley (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable</p> <h4 id="devonta-smith-wr">DeVonta Smith (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Smith finished as the Eagles’ leading receiver in a game during which his team threw for just 101 yards. It was a marked improvement from the veteran starter following last Thursday’s three-catch, 16-yard stinker in a win over the Cowboys. Expect Smith and the entire Philadelphia passing attack to be more involved next Sunday lining up opposite the Rams’ high-powered passing attack.</p> <h4 id="jalen-hurts-qb">Jalen Hurts (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Hurts managed to outduel Patrick Mahomes for the second time this calendar year in a Week 2 rematch of Super Bowl LIX. The 26-year-old Hurts has yet to throw a touchdown pass (or interception) through two starts in 2025, but his team has come out victorious on both occasions. Fantasy managers who drafted the dual-threat QB for his legs have been forced to rely almost exclusively on that part of his game for production early in the schedule. Hurts’ rushing totals through two games (23-77-3) resemble that of an RB1 in fantasy, highlighting what an advantage it is to have a mobile QB. The Eagles may call on Hurts to air it out more against the high-powered Rams when the NFC contenders face off next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="kaleb-johnson-rb">Kaleb Johnson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Johnson was on the field for just two offensive snaps for a second consecutive week. He played four snaps on special teams, but he didn’t pursue a ball that bounced past him on a kickoff in the fourth quarter, which allowed Seattle to recover in the end zone for a touchdown. The 22-year-old showcased some promise during the preseason after being selected in the third round of this year’s draft, but he hasn’t had a role in Pittsburgh’s offense behind Jaylen Warren and Kenneth Gainwell, and Johnson did little to instill confidence in Week 2.</p> <h4 id="dk-metcalf-wr">DK Metcalf (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Steelers’ passing attack took a significant step backward relative to Week 1, and Metcalf’s output fell accordingly. He still led the team with six targets, though his longest gain went for only nine yards. Metcalf managed to salvage his day with a leaping two-yard touchdown shortly before halftime for his first score as a Steeler, though it was otherwise a forgettable performance.</p> <h4 id="christian-mccaffrey-rb">Christian McCaffrey (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> With the 49ers’ offense missing a number of key players, including Brock Purdy (toe/shoulder), George Kittle (hamstring) and Brandon Aiyuk (knee), McCaffrey put the team on his back and carried it to a second straight victory to begin the season. His seven-yard TD reception from Mac Jones just before halftime was McCaffrey’s first score of the year, but he’s topped 100 scrimmage yards in both of the Niners’ games so far. In Week 3, he’ll take aim at a Cardinals defense he didn’t face during an injury-plagued 2024, but which he lit up for an incredible 364 combined yards and seven total touchdowns in their two 2023 meetings.</p> <h4 id="rachaad-white-rb">Rachaad White (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> White logged seven fewer carries than backfield mate Bucky Irving, but the former finished with only six fewer rushing yards. Additionally, White was the only one of the two backs to cross the goal line, powering in off right guard with six seconds remaining for the game-winning touchdown. White is still a clear complementary option to Irvin, but after taking only two carries in the Week 1 win over the Falcons, his workload boost Monday night was encouraging for fantasy managers. White next takes aim at a Jets defense Week 3 that just allowed 132 yards on 21 carries to the Bills’ James Cook on Sunday.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_2_2025_JST_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_2_2025_JST_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week2"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Fantasy Guru Kayden Week 2 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-2-KTT/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Fantasy Guru Kayden Week 2 Report"/><published>2025-09-16T15:11:24+00:00</published><updated>2025-09-16T15:11:24+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-2-KTT</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-2-KTT/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Fantasy Guru Kayden Won against Emma’s Excellent Team 99.40-67.94<br/> Current Standing: #9<br/> Playoff Chances: 53.5%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 82.8%<br/> Best Performer: Baker Mayfield (23.40 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="david-njoku-te">David Njoku (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Njoku tied for second in receptions and finished third in receiving yards on the afternoon for the Browns. Fellow tight end Harold Fannin still outpaced Njoku by one catch and eight receiving yards, however, although both players saw the same number of targets. It appears each will retain meaningful roles in the offense for the time being, and Njoku will head into a Week 3 home matchup against the Packers with a 7-77-0 receiving line on 11 targets.</p> <h4 id="evan-engram-te">Evan Engram (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Engram returned from the calf injury he sustained in Week 1, but he played only 43 percent of offensive snaps and worked behind Adam Trautman (62 percent), who brought in all three of his targets for 10 yards and a score. It’s possible Engram gets more involved in Week 3 against the Chargers as he improves his game fitness, but even before being injured in the opener he played just one snap, and the veteran chain-mover may not be as entrenched as the team’s No. 1 tight end as expected, with Trautman offering superior blocking ability. Fantasy managers may want to wait until Engram proves he’s earned a larger snap share before relying on him.</p> <h4 id="brian-thomas-jr-wr">Brian Thomas Jr. (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Thomas wasn’t listed on Jacksonville’s injury report leading up to Sunday’s loss, so his wrist injury could have been sustained over the weekend. An injury would somewhat explain Thomas’ inefficiency versus Cincinnati, as he secured just four of 12 targets for 49 yards during the narrow loss and at times seemed to visibly shy away from contact. Coen said Thomas “knows he needs to have a great week of practice,” per Mia O’Brien of 1010 XL 92.5 FM Jacksonville radio, so fantasy managers will need to monitor whether the Year 2 wideout is listed on Wednesday’s first injury report of Week 3 ahead of Sunday’s matchup against the Texans.</p> <h4 id="isiah-pacheco-rb">Isiah Pacheco (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Pacheco struggled to find any running room against the Eagles’ front seven, averaging a paltry 2.2 yards per tote in another forgettable fantasy showing. Things got so bleak that QB Patrick Mahomes wound up finishing as Kansas City’s leading rusher on just seven attempts (66 yards and a touchdown). The 0-2 Chiefs’ offense is in shambles to begin the season, but Pacheco retains the highest fantasy potential of any of the team’s backfield options heading into next Sunday’s tilt against the Giants.</p> <h4 id="ladd-mcconkey-wr">Ladd McConkey (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The second-year target narrowly missed out on a bigger fantasy day if not for some timely tackling by the Raiders, but McConkey was simply an afterthought compared to Keenan Allen (5-61-1 on seven targets) and Quentin Johnston (3-71-1 on seven targets) on the evening. McConkey saw fewer than five targets in just two games all of last season, so while the game script suggests the speedy target simply wasn’t needed in this one, the lack of volume could be something to monitor in future weeks.</p> <h4 id="devon-achane-rb">De’Von Achane (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Dolphins were already down 12-0 at the end of one quarter, which immediately put Achane in catch-up mode when it came to consistent rushing opportunities. As his final line indicates, those remained relatively sparse overall, but game script did work in his favor when it came to his pass-catching role. Achane finished as the Dolphins’ leader in both receptions and targets, while finishing second to only Tyreek Hill in receiving yards. Achane also went in for his second receiving touchdown in as many games to open the season when he recorded an impressive 29-yard grab late in the first half, and he’ll be slated for a key two-way role again during what is already essentially a must-win scenario for the Dolphins in a Week 3 Thursday night road matchup against the Bills.</p> <h4 id="darius-slayton-wr">Darius Slayton (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Slayton was shut out in the first half but salvaged a decent final line with 61 receiving yards after halftime. Most of that production came on a 52-yard connection with Russell Wilson midway through the third quarter. Despite that big play, it doesn’t bode well for his place in New York’s WR pecking order that Slayton saw just three targets despite playing all but one of the team’s offensive snaps, especially since Russell Wilson aired it out 41 times and gained 450 yards on 30 completions. It was already a given that Malik Nabers would hog the wideout targets for the Giants this season, but it’s telling that Wan’Dale Robinson garnered 10 looks of his own and nabbed eight receptions for a career-high 142 yards Sunday. With just five targets (and two catches) through two weeks, Slayton doesn’t appear to have established much chemistry with Wilson thus far.</p> <h4 id="wandale-robinson-wr">Wan’Dale Robinson (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> During a wild seesaw affair in which Russell Wilson threw for 450 yards, Robinson set a new career high that shattered his previous best of 100 yards, which he recorded in Week 11 of his rookie season in 2022. The possession receiver has had a strong start to the current campaign, posting a 14-197-1 line on 18 targets, and if the Giants fall behind early he could be busy again in Week 3 against Kansas City.</p> <h4 id="aaron-rodgers-qb">Aaron Rodgers (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Rodgers didn’t get much help from his pass catchers, but he still had a letdown performance in Week 2. His lone touchdown came on a lofted jump ball to DK Metcalf late in the first half from two yards away, and he also recorded three completions of at least 20 yards – though Rodgers still managed only 6.2 yards per attempt. While that was a significant departure from Week 1, Rodgers was let down by his pass catchers on a few occasions, most notably on a pass in the end zone that was deflected by Calvin Austin on a pass intended for Pat Freiermuth that was ultimately intercepted. With a subpar offensive line and below-average playmakers around him, it’s fair to expect more mediocre fantasy performances from Rodgers moving forward.</p> <h4 id="baker-mayfield-qb">Baker Mayfield (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Mayfield was in danger of a second straight sub-200-yard performance to open the season, but the veteran signal-caller came alive on Tampa Bay’s game-winning drive. He took the Bucs a total of 80 yards on 11 plays in just over two minutes, completing seven of nine passes while adding a 15-yard scramble before Rachaad White capped off the march with a two-yard touchdown run. In the second quarter, Mayfield also connected with Emeka Egbuka on a 15-yard scoring pass for the rookie’s third touchdown over the first two games. Despite completing just 60.0 percent of his passes through the first pair of contests, Mayfield also will take a sparkling 5:0 TD:INT into a Week 3 home matchup against the Jets on Sunday afternoon.</p> <h4 id="mike-evans-wr">Mike Evans (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Evans comfortably led the Buccaneers in targets and also set the pace in receiving yards, albeit by a smaller margin. The Texans did a good job overall disrupting the rhythm between Evans and Baker Mayfield, leading to Evans’ second straight five-catch, sub-60-yard effort to open the season. The successful QB-WR duo will look to author their first breakout performance of 2025 when the Buccaneers host the Jets in a Week 3 matchup on Sunday afternoon.</p> <h4 id="jayden-daniels-qb">Jayden Daniels (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Quinn added that Daniels underwent an MRI on Friday, and he’s “already begun his return to play process with us. … What does that mean for Sunday [against the Raiders]? I can’t tell you that now. I’ll share more when we get to Wednesday.” After Ian Rapoport of NFL Network reported earlier Monday that Daniels has a sprained knee, Quinn wouldn’t go as far, only calling it a “knee injury,” per Commanders writer Ben Standig. Wednesday’s practice report will reveal whether Daniels handles any practice reps to start Week 3 prep, but if he isn’t able to go this weekend, backup Marcus Mariota is on hand to lead the Commanders offense.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_2_2025_KTT_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_2_2025_KTT_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week2"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Michael’s Managable Team Week 2 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-2-MMT/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Michael’s Managable Team Week 2 Report"/><published>2025-09-16T15:11:24+00:00</published><updated>2025-09-16T15:11:24+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-2-MMT</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-2-MMT/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Michael’s Managable Team Won against Mama Daughter Duo 141.03-126.22<br/> Current Standing: #2<br/> Playoff Chances: 62.9%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 81.3%<br/> Best Performer: Drake Maye (35.80 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="khalil-shakir-wr">Khalil Shakir (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Shakir has struggled against a Jets defense with a strong secondary and plenty of weaknesses elsewhere, exceeding 25 receiving yards only once in seven career matchups in the AFC East rivalry. Buffalo’s 2024 leader in receiving yards has a nice opportunity to bounce back Thursday against a Dolphins defense that is allowing 33 points per game.</p> <h4 id="jake-ferguson-te">Jake Ferguson (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The tight end led the Cowboys in target volume during a wild seesaw affair and tied CeeDee Lamb for the team lead in receptions, although Lamb out-paced him in yards with 112. Ferguson has re-established himself as the main security blanket for Dak Prescott, and while he’s still looking for his first touchdown since he caught three against Green Bay in the wild-card round of the 2023 season, he’s delivered a 14-101-0 line on 18 targets through the first two games of the current campaign. Ferguson could hit paydirt in Week 3 against a Bears defense that just gave up a TD to the Lions’ Brock Wright, one of five touchdowns thrown by Jared Goff in a 52-21 rout.</p> <h4 id="george-pickens-wr">George Pickens (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> While he took a back seat to CeeDee Lamb (9-112-0 on 11 targets) and tight end Jake Ferguson (9-78-0 on 12 targets) in terms of volume, Pickens came up big for the Cowboys with a six-yard TD grab from Dak Prescott with less than a minute left in the fourth quarter that gave the team a 34-30 lead – and which proved to be only the fourth-last score of the afternoon in a wild back-and-forth affair. It was Pickens’ first trip to the end zone for Dallas after a fairly quiet debut, but he could be headed for even bigger numbers in Week 3 against a Bears secondary that just got lit up for four receiving touchdowns by the Lions’ top WR duo of Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jameson Williams.</p> <h4 id="rj-harvey-rb">RJ Harvey (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Harvey made the most of his limited touches in Week 1, but he couldn’t repeat that same effort against the Colts. He was out-touched 15-6 by J.K. Dobbins, and Dobbins was also more effective with the opportunity. Harvey is a strong bench stash and can have productive games early this season, but it appears that will require him to be extremely efficient with limited touches.</p> <h4 id="jahmyr-gibbs-rb">Jahmyr Gibbs (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Although Jared Goff and Amon-Ra St. Brown mostly stole the show in Detroit’s jaw-dropping offensive breakout, Gibbs rather quietly put together a fruitful fantasy performance. The dynamic back outpaced David Montgomery by one carry and 37 rushing yards, with Gibbs’ game-long 42-yard scamper the big difference between the two backfield mates. Gibbs also recorded his first rushing touchdown of the season on a six-yard run in the first quarter, which served to round out his production on a day where he was limited to a mid-level workload. Gibbs will look to navigate a particularly challenging matchup when the Lions travel to Baltimore to face the Ravens in a Week 3 Monday night showdown on Sept. 22.</p> <h4 id="woody-marks-rb">Woody Marks (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Marks was bumped up the depth chart after veteran backup Dameon Pierce was made a healthy scratch ahead of Monday’s kickoff. The 24-year-old Marks responded well by converting his four touches into 51 total yards backing up Nick Chubb (14-72-1 from scrimmage). Marks is unlikely to see his workload increase against the Jaguars on Sunday, but he is a name to keep an eye on if the 0-2 Texans continue to slide and decide to give the rookie an extended look later in the season.</p> <h4 id="daniel-jones-qb">Daniel Jones (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Jones proved his Week 1 performance against Miami was no fluke, as he completed three passes of more than 40 yards while averaging 9.4 yards per attempt. He effectively targeted all of his pass catchers, though Tyler Warren looks to be his favorite of the group. Jones also picked up his third rushing touchdown of the season after falling into the end zone on the second of two consecutive quarterback sneaks at the goal line. Jones has had a strong start to his time with the Colts, as he now has five total touchdowns with no turnovers while averaging 9.3 yards per attempt across two games.</p> <h4 id="michael-pittman-jr-wr">Michael Pittman Jr. (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Pittman took on a lesser role among the Colts’ pass catchers in Week 2, tying for third on the team in targets. He was also limited to receptions in short areas of the field, with his longest gain going for just 12 yards. Tyler Warren appears to have the most consistent pass-catching role in Indianapolis early this season, which could mean inconsistent production for Pittman moving forward given the significant roles of both Josh Downs and Alec Pierce in the offense.</p> <h4 id="bhayshul-tuten-rb">Bhayshul Tuten (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> In his first game without the traded Tank Bigsby on the roster, Tuten served as the clear No. 2 back behind Travis Etienne, logging a relatively modest six fewer carries than his backfield mate. Tuten also struck for his first NFL touchdown through the air, as he recorded an eight-yard scoring grab early in the second quarter. Tuten’s five-carry boost from Week 1 was encouraging and confirmation of his status as the main complementary option to Etienne, and he’ll look to carry over his momentum into a Week 3 home divisional showdown against the Texans next Sunday afternoon.</p> <h4 id="justin-herbert-qb">Justin Herbert (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Herbert took what the defense gave him all evening, and the Raiders never seemed to have an answer. The sixth-year quarterback efficiently marched down the field whenever Los Angeles needed a sustaining drive, and were it not for the ineptitude of Geno Smith and company on the other side, Herbert probably could have pressed further for a bigger game. It’s clear the 27-year-old is looking to be more mobile in 2025, as that’s now back-to-back games with 30 or more rushing yards, a feat he accomplished just four times total last season.</p> <h4 id="davante-adams-wr">Davante Adams (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Adams led the Rams’ pass catchers in targets and receiving yards, thanks in large part to long catches of 33 and 26 yards. He also recorded his first touchdown as a Ram on a 16-yard connection in the back corner of the end zone midway through the fourth quarter. Adams showed strong rapport with Matthew Stafford, which should bode well for his production moving forward, though he and the Rams will face a tough matchup against the Eagles in Week 3.</p> <h4 id="tj-hockenson-te">T.J. Hockenson (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Hockenson caught just 33 percent of his targets in a low-volume night of offense from Minnesota, resulting in a mediocre stat line for fantasy managers. The receiving tight end is averaging just two receptions and 13.5 yards in two games with 2025 starting QB J.J. McCarthy. That is a concerning trend for a player hoping to bounce back from a lackluster 2024 campaign. Hockenson’s next opportunity to right the ship will come in a home game against Cincinnati next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="drake-maye-qb">Drake Maye (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Maye tossed first-quarter touchdown passes of eight yards to Mack Hollins and 16 yards to Kayshon Boutte, then ran in a six-yard touchdown in the third quarter. The 2024 third overall pick has demonstrated consistent playmaking ability with his legs, reaching 30 rushing yards in seven of his first 14 NFL starts. This was only his fifth game with multiple touchdown passes, but Maye tied his career best in completion percentage Sunday, suggesting he’s improving as a passer heading into a Week 3 home game against the Steelers, who have surprisingly allowed 31.5 points per game this season.</p> <h4 id="alvin-kamara-rb">Alvin Kamara (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> After needing a touchdown to salvage his Week 1 performance, Kamara topped 100 scrimmage yards for the first time in 2025 in Week 2. The veteran RB needed volume to get there though, as his longest run went for only 15 yards. Kamara remains the centerpiece of the Saints’ offense under new head coach Kellen Moore, and he could have a big day through the air in Week 3 against a Seahawks defense that has given up 159 combined receiving yards to the Steelers’ Jaylen Warren and the 49ers’ Christian McCaffrey to begin the season.</p> <h4 id="ricky-pearsall-wr">Ricky Pearsall (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The second-year wideout couldn’t repeat his big Week 1 performance with Mac Jones under center instead of Brock Purdy (toe/shoulder), but Pearsall still delivered solid production while finishing third on the 49ers in volume behind Jauan Jennings (10 targets) and Christian McCaffrey (seven). Purdy is expected to miss multiple weeks, but Pearsall’s involvement in the passing game Sunday suggests there’s little reason to downgrade his outlook while catching passes from Jones. Pearsall could be busy again in Week 3 against the Cardinals.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_2_2025_MMT_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_2_2025_MMT_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week2"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Americas Team Week 2 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-2-RRT/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Americas Team Week 2 Report"/><published>2025-09-16T15:11:24+00:00</published><updated>2025-09-16T15:11:24+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-2-RRT</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-2-RRT/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Americas Team Lost against 90s MonCon 148.62-157.15<br/> Current Standing: #10<br/> Playoff Chances: 28.3%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 83.9%<br/> Best Performer: Ja’Marr Chase (29.50 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="trey-mcbride-te">Trey McBride (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> McBride finished as the Cardinals’ leading receiver after ceding that honor to WR Marvin Harrison in Week 1. The 25-year-old McBride has racked up six receptions in each of his two starts so far, putting him on pace for another 100-plus reception season following last year’s breakout 111-catch campaign. McBride’s allergy to the end zone (career high of three TDs in 2023) is what holds him back from breaking the fantasy stratosphere. The Colorado State product is still a PPR monster and a TE1 play against the 49ers next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="deandre-hopkins-wr">DeAndre Hopkins (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Hopkins has been much more of a short-area target over the last few seasons, but the veteran flashed his downfield chops on both his catches Sunday. Hopkins nearly had a touchdown on his first grab, which covered 41 yards early in the third quarter and was originally ruled a score before replay review revealed Hopkins hadn’t broken the plane of the goal line. There was no ambiguity on his second and final reception of the night, a 23-yard scoring grab with just under five minutes remaining that closed out Baltimore’s scoring on the day. Hopkins has taken half of his first four catches in a Ravens uniform for touchdowns, affording him some momentum heading into a Week 3 home matchup against the Lions on Monday night, Sept. 22.</p> <h4 id="chuba-hubbard-rb">Chuba Hubbard (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Hubbard salvaged another pedestrian rushing performance with a late receiving touchdown in the Panthers’ second loss of the season. The 26-year-old starter snuck out of the backfield for a five-yard score in the fourth quarter, also scoring the ensuing two-point attempt for good measure. Hubbard continues to dominate the backfield touches in Carolina, making him a starting level fantasy option heading into next Sunday’s tilt against Atlanta.</p> <h4 id="jamarr-chase-wr">Ja’Marr Chase (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Chase struggled in Week 1 against the Browns along with the rest of the Bengals’ offense. However, he bounced back in a big way in Week 2, doubling up Tee Higgins in targets while accounting for over half of the team’s yards through the air. His touchdown came from four yards away early in the first quarter, and he then tacked on receptions of 25, 16, 14 and 13 yards. Even more impressive was that the majority of Chase’s production came with Jake Browning under center after Joe Burrow departed in the second quarter with an apparent toe injury. If Burrow is sidelined for an extended period, Chase’s production would likely dip, but his talent and role will keep him locked in as a top option at wide receiver.</p> <h4 id="david-montgomery-rb">David Montgomery (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Montgomery and backfield mate Jahmyr Gibbs each recorded a rushing touchdown, and Montgomery also had just one fewer carry than his star teammate, albeit while compiling 37 fewer rushing yards. Montgomery still averaged 5.2 yards per carry, however, and he rang up his first TD of the season on a one-yard run late in the first quarter. Through two games, it appears the backs will continue to operate in a fairly close timeshare, but they face a thorny matchup in a Week 3 road trip to face the Ravens on Monday night, Sept. 22.</p> <h4 id="dalton-schultz-te">Dalton Schultz (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Schultz turned in another mild fantasy score despite finishing second in targets for the Texans. The veteran starter provides predictability for those in deeper formats, but his lack of upside and scoring potential (two touchdowns over 17 starts in 2024) keep him from flourishing in fantasy circles. Schultz remains a low-end option heading into a Week 3 matchup against the Jaguars on Sunday.</p> <h4 id="josh-downs-wr">Josh Downs (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Downs wasn’t prioritized in the Colts’ Week 1 offense, though he led the team in both targets and receptions in Week 2. He was busy early in the game, as he recorded two receptions for 29 yards on the team’s first four offensive plays. Tyler Warren has quickly emerged as Daniel Jones’ favorite target, leaving Downs as likely to rotate productive games with the likes of Michael Pittman and Alec Pierce.</p> <h4 id="travis-etienne-jr-rb">Travis Etienne Jr. (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Etienne went a long way toward proving his breakout Week 1 performance was no fluke, as he averaged 5.1 yards per carry while comfortably pacing the Jaguars in rush attempts and rushing yards. The versatile veteran also made his mark as a receiver via an 11-yard touchdown catch with just over four minutes remaining in the third quarter, his first score of any kind in the new season. With ex-backfield mate Tank Bigsby now in Philadelphia, Etienne looks entrenched as the clear-cut No. 1 back in head coach Liam Coen’s productive offense going into a Week 3 home divisional matchup against the Texans next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="matthew-stafford-qb">Matthew Stafford (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Stafford wasn’t sharp in the first half, totaling only 106 yards while also throwing an interception just before halftime that set up a field goal for Tennessee. However, he completed three passes of at least 20 yards in the second half – the longest of which was a 40-yard pass to Jordan Whittington – and also capped two drives with touchdown passes of eight and 16 yards, respectively. Stafford has not appeared limited by a back injury that drew a lot of attention in the preseason, as he has averaged 8.8 yards per attempt with three touchdowns across two games.</p> <h4 id="rhamondre-stevenson-rb">Rhamondre Stevenson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Stevenson set a new career high in receiving yards, fueled by a 55-yard reception in the third quarter. He operated as the lead back while rookie second-round pick TreVeyon Henderson and Antonio Gibson combined for eight carries and three targets, though Gibson also contributed a kickoff return touchdown on special teams. Stevenson is the team’s preferred option on early downs, and he could hold off the alternatives in passing situations if he continues to shine as a pass catcher like he did Sunday. The 27-year-old running back’s fantasy value is trending up ahead of a Week 3 home game against a Steelers run defense that has struggled to begin the season.</p> <h4 id="spencer-rattler-qb">Spencer Rattler (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The second-year quarterback kept the Saints in the game with TD tosses Juwan Johnson in the second quarter, Rashid Shaheed in the third and Devaughn Vele in the fourth, but Rattler’s attempt at a game-winning drive in the final three minutes stalled out around midfield. The three scores were a career high for the QB, who tossed only four in seven games as a rookie. Perhaps more impressive is the fact he’s gone two straight starts without committing a turnover to begin 2025. Rattler will try to get his team into the win column in Week 3 against the Seahawks.</p> <h4 id="aj-brown-wr">A.J. Brown (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> This was certainly an improvement over last week’s one-catch showing, but the end result was still poor from a fantasy perspective. DeVonta Smith (4-53-0) finished as the Eagles’ leading receiver with Brown leading the team in targets (eight) and receptions (five). Philadelphia’s run-heavy offense to kick off the 2025 season is the main culprit for the entire receiving corps posting paltry totals through two games. Perhaps Brown and the rest of the Eagles’ aerial attack will finally take off in what could be a high-scoring affair against the Rams next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="brian-robinson-jr-rb">Brian Robinson Jr. (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Robinson struggled to find much running room with his allotted touches Sunday. The 26-year-old wound up playing 16 snaps on offense (23 percent) and was still the only backup runner deployed behind Christian McCaffrey. Robinson will continue serving a change-of-pace role for the 49ers against the Cardinals next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="cooper-kupp-wr">Cooper Kupp (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Kupp bounced back from a two-catch Seahawks debut but once again finished second on the team in receiving yards behind Jaxon Smith-Njigba. Kupp and JSN combined for 19 targets while no other teammate had more than four, but Sam Darnold’s first two touchdown passes of the season went to Tory Horton and AJ Barner. Up next for Seattle’s new-look passing game is a Week 3 home game against the Saints.</p> <h4 id="sam-darnold-qb">Sam Darnold (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Darnold threw a 21-yard touchdown pass to Tory Horton on the opening drive, but Seattle failed to score on any of its other five first-half possessions, two of which ended in Darnold interceptions. He found success again at the start of the second half, tying the game at 14-14 with a seven-yard touchdown pass to AJ Barner. Seattle’s defense and the Kenneth Walker-led rushing attack took over from there as Darnold earned his first win with the team. Darnold posted a 35:12 TD:INT with the Vikings in the 2024 regular season but has a modest 2:2 mark heading into a Week 3 home game against the Saints.</p> <h4 id="jaxon-smith-njigba-wr">Jaxon Smith-Njigba (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Smith-Njigba exceeded 100 receiving yards while pacing the Seahawks in targets, catches and receiving yards for the second time in as many games, quickly establishing himself as the top target for new Seattle quarterback Sam Darnold. JSN’s still searching for his first TD of 2025 after scoring six times in his breakout sophomore season last year, but his robust volume gives Smith-Njigba one of the highest fantasy floors among wide receivers heading into a Week 3 home game against the Saints.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_2_2025_RRT_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_2_2025_RRT_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week2"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">To Infinity and Bijan!

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="kyler-murray-qb">Kyler Murray (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> It was a tale of two halves for Murray, who had his team up comfortably going into the break but was barely clinging onto victory when time expired. An untimely interception to end a 70-yard drive in the fourth quarter played a huge role in letting Carolina back into this contest. It was Murray’s first interception of the season to go along with his three passing touchdowns and 70 rushing yards through two starts in 2025. The dual-threat QB is shaping up to be a high-floor, low-ceiling fantasy option in a road matchup against a tough 49ers defense next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="darnell-mooney-wr">Darnell Mooney (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> After missing Week 1 due to a shoulder injury, Mooney didn’t have an injury designation heading into Sunday Night Football. He played 57 of 66 offensive snaps during his season debut, which led Atlanta’s WRs (Drake London finished with 56). Despite being on the field often, Mooney failed to haul in either of his targets in the first half, and both of his receptions came within three plays during the Falcons’ first drive of the second half. The run game was the clear emphasis for Atlanta during Sunday’s defensive-dominated game, as Falcons QB Michael Penix attempted only 21 passes after throwing 41 times Week 1. Mooney is the clear No. 2 wideout behind London and will look to get more involved against the Panthers in Week 3. However, it’ll be difficult for any pass catchers to deliver consistent production if the Falcons are pushing 40 rushing attempts consistently.</p> <h4 id="kyle-pitts-sr-te">Kyle Pitts Sr. (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Despite turning in a modest line, this was a relatively encouraging performance for Pitts. He tied for the team lead in targets and paced all pass catchers in receptions, with his lack of production explained primarily by the Falcons attempting only 21 passes. Pitts now has 11 catches for 96 yards across the first two games of the season and looks to be a favorite target of Michael Penix.</p> <h4 id="mark-andrews-te">Mark Andrews (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Andrews was inexplicably absent from the scoring parade on a night where the Ravens dropped a 40-burger. Perhaps the veteran tight end was still dealing with the undisclosed injury that kept him out of preseason action. Whatever the case, Andrews missed a prime opportunity to operate as the top tight end with Isaiah Likely (foot) sitting this one out. The latter could return as soon as next Sunday’s tilt against the Browns, but Andrews didn’t inspire confidence in fantasy managers even if Likely misses a second consecutive game.</p> <h4 id="keon-coleman-wr">Keon Coleman (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Coleman came back down to earth after recording 112 receiving yards and a touchdown in the season opener, as all three of Buffalo’s Week 2 touchdowns came on the ground. The Bills will likely continue to spread the ball around, but the 2024 second-round pick leads the team with 14 targets and 138 receiving yards heading into Thursday’s home game against a Dolphins defense that has allowed 33 points to each of its first two opponents.</p> <h4 id="tetairoa-mcmillan-wr">Tetairoa McMillan (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The eighth-overall pick in this year’s draft is living up to the hype, recording the first 100-yard receiving game of his career in just his second pro appearance. McMillan paced the Panthers in targets and yardage after accomplishing the same feat last week, as he’s quickly become Bryce Young’s most-trusted target out of the gates. The Arizona product is already making fantasy waves before scoring the first touchdown of his career, which is likely just around the corner given the wideout’s 6-foot-5 frame and tremendous ball skills. McMillan belongs in starting fantasy lineups heading into a Week 3 matchup against the Falcons next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="luther-burden-iii-wr">Luther Burden III (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Burden has a total of three targets over the first two games, and the rookie is the clear No. 4 receiver in the offense. Burden’s biggest contribution to the team has been as a kick returner. It’s possible that Burden sees his role grow over the course of the season if he can impress the coaching staff.</p> <h4 id="javonte-williams-rb">Javonte Williams (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> After scoring two TDs in a Week 1 loss to the Eagles, Williams churned out another big performance in his second game as a Cowboy, highlighted by a 30-yard run in the third quarter for his third score of the season. The veteran back did benefit from some missed tackles by Giants defenders, but he also showed impressive power, and he continues to solidify his hold on the top job in the Dallas backfield. In Week 3, Williams will take aim at a Bears defense that just got gashed for a combined 151 rushing yards and two touchdowns by the Lions duo of Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery.</p> <h4 id="isaac-teslaa-wr">Isaac TeSlaa (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> TeSlaa was expected to see an increase in workload with the offense Week 2, and he saw his offensive snap count rise from three snaps in Week 1 to 17 against Chicago on Sunday. The wide receiver once again provided a highlight reel catch, securing a leaping one-handed snag up the sideline for 29 yards to get the Lions inside the five-yard line with less than 20 seconds left in the first half. Through two games in 2025, TeSlaa has made two acrobatic catches on the two targets he’s garnered, and he’ll keep earning more opportunities if he continues to deliver results for Detroit. Fellow wide receiver Kalif Raymond saw his offensive snaps drop from 42 in Week 1 to 32 versus the Bears, so TeSlaa may already be challenging for the No. 3 role behind Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jameson Williams.</p> <h4 id="nick-chubb-rb">Nick Chubb (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Chubb was having trouble finding running room for most of this contest before finally ripping off a 25-yard touchdown scamper late in the fourth quarter. The 29-year-old continued dominating Houston’s backfield touches sans Joe Mixon (foot/ankle), with rookie Woody Marks’ three carries checking in a distant second behind the veteran starter. Chubb is looking like a solid flex candidate Week 3 heading into a potential soft matchup against the Jaguars on Sunday.</p> <h4 id="quentin-johnston-wr">Quentin Johnston (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Johnson had multiple critical drops in the first quarter, but for a second consecutive week the 24-year-old once again connected with Justin Herbert on a beautiful frozen rope this time for a 60-yard touchdown that proved to be all the scoring necessary to beat the Raiders. The 2023 first-round pick did tie for the team high with seven targets, but unlike Keenan Allen and Ladd McConkey, the majority of Johnston’s targets appeared to be scripted and don’t necessarily indicate a potential bump in volume on a week-to-week basis.</p> <h4 id="justin-jefferson-wr">Justin Jefferson (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Jefferson was able to rip off a huge 50-yard gain on Atlanta’s defense, but he was otherwise held in check Sunday. QB J.J. McCarthy completed just 11 passes for 158 yards in the ugly loss, with his top wideout accounting for nearly half of his total production. Jefferson has gotten off to a slower start in 2025 with McCarthy (7-125-1) under center compared to the two-week sample we saw with 2024 starter Sam Darnold (8-192-2). Even with the slight drop-off in production, Jefferson remains an unquestioned fantasy WR1 heading into a Week 3 matchup against Ja’Marr Chase and the Bengals next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="treveyon-henderson-rb">TreVeyon Henderson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Henderson was out-touched by both Rhamondre Stevenson (16) and Antonio Gibson (six) on offense. Stevenson looks like the lead back in New England, at least for now, while Henderson is stuck splitting change-of-pace duties with Gibson. The speedy Henderson has the talent to take on a larger role as the season unfolds, but the rookie second-round pick could be held back by a lack of volume again when the Patriots host the Steelers in Week 3.</p> <h4 id="malik-nabers-wr">Malik Nabers (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Russell Wilson turned back the clock with a performance reminiscent of his best days in Seattle, and Nabers was his main target, catching a 29-yard TD in the second quarter and a 48-yard score with just 25 seconds left in the fourth that appeared to have won the game for the Giants before Brandon Aubrey booted a ridiculous 64-yard field goal as time expired to send it to OT. Nabers has seen 25 targets through two games from Wilson, turning that volume into a 14-238-2 line, but he may not face a secondary as weak as Dallas’ current unit for the rest of the season. The sixth overall pick in the 2024 Draft will look to prove he’s matchup-proof in Week 3 against Kansas City.</p> <h4 id="justin-fields-qb">Justin Fields (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Before his departure from the Jets’ 30-10 loss, Fields completed three of 11 pass attempts for 27 yards and added five carries for 49 yards. With the QB’s concussion confirmed by the Jets, per Cimini, Fields now will have to progress through the NFL’s protocol for head injuries in order to play next weekend against the Buccaneers. If Fields isn’t cleared for Week 3 action, Tyrod Taylor would be in line to start in his place.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_2_2025_TIB_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_2_2025_TIB_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week2"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry></feed>
