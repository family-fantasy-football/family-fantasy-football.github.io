</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="isaiah-likely-te">Isaiah Likely (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable</p> <h4 id="lamar-jackson-qb">Lamar Jackson (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Jackson’s stat line was practically pristine, with the two-time MVP finishing the night boasting a 148.1 QB rating. However, Jackson wasn’t able to help the Ravens keep pace with an aggressive Lions offense that successfully converted two fourth-quarter fourth-down opportunities. Jackson did pad his numbers somewhat on Baltimore’s last drive, a possession he capped off with a 27-yard touchdown pass to Mark Andrews, his second of the night to the veteran tight end. Jackson also connected with Rashod Bateman for a three-yard scoring strike just before halftime, and he’ll head into a Week 4 road showdown against Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs with a stellar 9:0 TD:INT through his first three games of 2025.</p> <h4 id="joe-flacco-qb">Joe Flacco (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> As his final numbers indicate, Flacco didn’t play particularly well, finishing with under 200 passing yards for the second straight game while also failing to throw at least one touchdown pass for the first time this season. Flacco did spread the ball around effectively to eight different pass catchers, although David Njoku’s 40 receiving yards qualified as a team-high figure. The veteran signal-caller did complete a key eight-yard pass to Njoku on Cleveland’s final drive to set up Andre Szmyt’s game-winning field goal, and Flacco will continue under center in a challenging Week 4 road matchup against the Lions next Sunday afternoon.</p> <h4 id="quinshon-judkins-rb">Quinshon Judkins (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Logging his first official NFL start, Judkins set the tone for his second productive performance in as many career games with a seven-yard gain on the Browns’ first play from scrimmage. The rookie second-round pick would go on to add a game-long 38-yard run shortly before the halfway point of the fourth quarter, and he then powered in for a one-yard touchdown later in the period that erased a 10-3 deficit. Judkins already looks like a bona fide No. 1 back, and he could see his workload bump up a notch following another week of practice ahead of a Week 4 road matchup against the Lions.</p> <h4 id="jameson-williams-wr">Jameson Williams (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Williams garnered a season-low three targets in a contest where the passing offense took a back seat to monster rushing performances from Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery. The 24-year-old Williams managed to break off a couple of chunk plays on his two grabs, but the end result was mediocre from a fantasy perspective without a trip to the end zone. Williams is averaging a massive 21.8 yards per reception this season, so there’s upside available for those who can stomach the lows that come with a boom-or-bust asset. The Lions will prepare to host a tough Cleveland defense Sunday.</p> <h4 id="nico-collins-wr">Nico Collins (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The big-bodied receiver was able to persevere through a ragged overall day for Houston’s air attack, finishing as the Texans’ leader in receptions, receiving yards and targets. Collins also found the end zone for the second time in as many games when he recorded a 50-yard touchdown grab on what appeared to be a blown coverage by Jacksonville in the fourth quarter. However, he also committed a critical fumble at the Jaguars’ 21-yard line with just under four minutes remaining following a 10-yard catch, leading to Jacksonville’s game-winning touchdown. Collins will take a 14-181-2 line on 25 targets into a Week 4 home date against the Titans next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="jonathan-taylor-rb">Jonathan Taylor (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Despite his final line, the Titans did a good job of limiting Taylor for much of the game. He punched in a pair of scores from one yard away in the first and fourth quarters. Taylor also broke the contest open and accounted for a significant portion of his yardage with an impressive 46-yard touchdown late in the third quarter, during which he broke through several tackles and evaded additional defenders with a spin move. Taylor now has four total touchdowns on the season and has topped 100 rushing yards in consecutive contests.</p> <h4 id="brock-bowers-te">Brock Bowers (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The second-year tight end had a second straight quiet performance after picking up a minor knee injury in Week 1. Despite lacking the explosiveness that led to a record-setting rookie season, Bowers has still remained a big part of the Raiders’ passing game and has at least four catches in three straight contests, leading to a 14-179-0 line on 21 targets. With the knee issue further behind him, Bowers could roar back to life in Week 4 against a Bears defense that has been one of the worst units in the NFL to begin the year.</p> <h4 id="jaylen-waddle-wr">Jaylen Waddle (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Waddle went into pregame warmups uncertain to play due to a shoulder issue, but he finished tied with Tyreek Hill for first in receptions among the Dolphins’ wideouts. Like his teammate, Waddle also got into the end zone, scoring on a three-yard grab just before halftime to erase a 14-7 deficit. Waddle has at least four receptions in each of the Dolphins’ first three games and now has scored in two straight, but he’s averaging just 9.8 yards per catch heading into a Week 4 Monday night home divisional clash against the Jets on Sept. 29.</p> <h4 id="tua-tagovailoa-qb">Tua Tagovailoa (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Tagovailoa didn’t come close to following up his 315-yard tally from Sunday’s loss to the Patriots, although he did manage to throw multiple touchdown passes for the second straight contest. He connected with Jaylen Waddle (three yards) and Tyreek Hill (five yards) for his pair of scoring tosses Thursday, but his interception on what appeared to be a poor read at the Bills’ 17-yard line with just over three minutes remaining ended up being the decisive play in Miami’s third loss in as many games to open 2025. The 2020 first-round pick now has thrown for under 150 yards in two of the first three games of the season while also tossing at least one pick in each contest, depressing his fantasy stock heading into a Week 4 home matchup against the Jets on Monday night, Sept. 29.</p> <h4 id="jordan-addison-wr">Jordan Addison (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Addison was suspended for the first three games of the 2025 regular season for violating the league’s Substances of Abuse Policy, but the 2023 first-rounder is now poised to return to action this weekend against the Steelers. The wideout thus is on track to resume practicing this week and should have an immediate opportunity to reclaim his key role in a Minnesota WR corps led by Justin Jefferson. Addison’s looming return figures to impact the fantasy upside of Jalen Nailor and Adam Thielen but will provide a boost to a passing attack that was helmed by QB Carson Wentz in Week 3 and likely will be for at least another week. In 15 regular-season games last year, Addison logged a 63-875-9 line on 99 targets.</p> <h4 id="jordan-mason-rb">Jordan Mason (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Making his first start in place of Aaron Jones (IR, hamstring), Mason delivered on lofty expectations from fantasy managers with an ultra-efficient performance. The offseason addition consistently rattled off productive gains throughout the afternoon, and he found the end zone from five and four yards out in the second and third quarter, respectively. Mason shared work with Zavier Scott (eight carries) and Cam Akers (five carries), but that was at least partly a byproduct of the Vikings being able to rest starters in the second half. Mason will remain a coveted option in all formats when Minnesota faces off with the Steelers in Dublin, Ireland in Week 4.</p> <h4 id="garrett-wilson-wr">Garrett Wilson (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Despite having Tyrod Taylor under center instead of Justin Fields (concussion), Wilson was still the clear top downfield option for the Jets, as none of his teammates saw more than six targets or caught more than four passes, and his 11-yard TD catch from Taylor early in the fourth quarter kicked off an attempted comeback from a 23-6 deficit by New York. Wilson will take a 21-229-2 line on 30 targets into a Week 4 meeting with the Dolphins.</p> <h4 id="calvin-austin-iii-wr">Calvin Austin III (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The third-year wideout hauled in a 17-yard toss from Aaron Rodgers with a little over two minutes left in the fourth quarter to break a 14-14 tie. Austin has quickly earned the veteran QB’s trust, and after scoring five TDs in 34 games through his first two NFL seasons, he already has two in the first three contests of 2025, part of an 8-126-2 line on 15 targets. Austin will look to stay productive in Week 4 against the Vikings.</p> <h4 id="jaylen-warren-rb">Jaylen Warren (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The fourth-year running back caught multiple passes for the third straight game to begin the season, with the five grabs and six targets both being season highs. Warren was denied a much bigger fantasy performance when Kenneth Gainwell vultured a one-yard rushing TD in the first quarter, however. Warren has racked up 274 scrimmage yards so far as the Steelers’ unquestioned lead back, and he’ll look to continue his PPR prowess in Week 4 against the Vikings.</p> <h4 id="jauan-jennings-wr">Jauan Jennings (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_3_2025_90s_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_3_2025_90s_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week3"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Abbey’s TNT Team Week 3 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-3-ARV/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Abbey’s TNT Team Week 3 Report"/><published>2025-09-23T18:35:42+00:00</published><updated>2025-09-23T18:35:42+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-3-ARV</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-3-ARV/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Abbey’s TNT Team 🧨 Won against Rookie Mistake 120.18-94.53<br/> Current Standing: #5<br/> Playoff Chances: 65.3%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 88.3%<br/> Best Performer: Geno Smith (31.56 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="bijan-robinson-rb">Bijan Robinson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> A field day was expected for the Falcons’ ground attack going in, but the Panthers defense completely turned that expectation on its head with a surprisingly dominant performance. Robinson still managed to churn out a solid effort that highlighted both his rushing and receiving acumen, but his workload on the ground was certainly more sparse than it would have been had the Falcons made good on their status as solid favorites. Robinson will next take aim at the Commanders defense when Washington pays Atlanta a visit for a Week 4 matchup next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="xavier-legette-wr">Xavier Legette (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable</p> <h4 id="colston-loveland-te">Colston Loveland (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Loveland suffered a hip injury during the second quarter of Sunday’s win over the Cowboys, but it appears he has a chance to avoid missing any significant time. The rookie first-rounder flashed his downfield playmaking ability before leaving the field versus Dallas, securing one of three targets for 31 yards. If Loveland is forced to miss time or face a limited snap count, Cole Kmet will handle an expanded workload at tight end.</p> <h4 id="dylan-sampson-rb">Dylan Sampson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Sampson was on the field for just five offensive snaps and went untargeted for the first time in three weeks. He had eight targets in Week 1 followed by a touchdown catch last week, but it looks like Jerome Ford has emerged as the primary target out of the backfield. In addition to the diminished targets, Sampson’s overall usage has taken a hit, dropping from 33 snaps in Week 1 to 17 in Week 2 and now five. That drop coincides with the availability of Quinshon Judkins.</p> <h4 id="jaydon-blue-rb">Jaydon Blue (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Blue has now been a healthy scratch in each of Dallas’ first three games of the campaign. Javonte Williams and Miles Sanders will again be the team’s two active RBs in Week 3.</p> <h4 id="bo-nix-qb">Bo Nix (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Nix didn’t perform particularly poorly, rather falling victim to a dominating ball-control performance from the Chargers (-12:40 in time of possession Sunday). The dual-threat quarterback recorded his highest rushing total of the campaign in the loss while committing no turnovers for the first time in three starts. Nix will attempt to put it all together in a very favorable matchup against the Bengals next Monday.</p> <h4 id="kalif-raymond-wr">Kalif Raymond (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Raymond remains an afterthought on offense for Detroit, and his production dropped for the third week in a row. The wide receiver is firmly behind Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jameson Williams on the depth chart, and his weekly upside is greatly reduced as a result. On the year, he’s caught four of six targets for 34 yards, while also adding a nine-yard carry over three games.</p> <h4 id="geno-smith-qb">Geno Smith (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> All three TDs went to Tre Tucker, as the duo connected on 10-yard scores in the second and fourth quarters before Smith found his speedy wideout for a 61-yard strike late in the game as the Raiders tried to mount a comeback. It was a strong bounce-back performance from Smith after he got picked off three times by the Chargers in Week 2, but the result was the same for Las Vegas. Smith will try to guide his team back into the win column in Week 4 against an injury-ravaged Bears defense.</p> <h4 id="kyren-williams-rb">Kyren Williams (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Williams easily led the Rams backfield in carries, but Blake Corum continued to carve out a role in the offense with eight rushing attempts. That didn’t affect Williams’ performance in Week 3, as he still managed a season high in both carries and yardage. Williams also made an impact as a receiver for the first time on the campaign, catching a 10-yard touchdown to kick off the third quarter. While Williams may be losing some of his workload, the Rams offense should be efficient enough for him to remain a reliable fantasy contributor moving forward.</p> <h4 id="puka-nacua-wr">Puka Nacua (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Nacua dominated opportunity amongst the Rams’ receiving corps, accounting for 15 targets on 34 total pass attempts for the team. It wasn’t his most efficient performance, though he still managed long gains of 20, 15 and 12 yards to top 100 yards from scrimmage for the third stright game to begin the campaign. While Davante Adams has been impactful in the Rams’ offense, Nacua looks likely to remain the top producer most weeks.</p> <h4 id="tyreek-hill-wr">Tyreek Hill (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Hill led the Dolphins in targets and receiving yards on the night, adding his first touchdown catch of the season on a five-yard grab early in the fourth quarter. The mercurial speedster has logged 23 targets through three games and parlayed them into a 15-198-1 line, but Tua Tagovailoa’s overall struggles and the general malaise that’s seemingly befallen the Dolphins keeps Hill’s fantasy outlook somewhat murky heading into a Week 4 home matchup against the Jets on Monday night, Sept. 29, a game where he’s likely to see plenty of Sauce Gardner’s coverage.</p> <h4 id="tank-bigsby-rb">Tank Bigsby (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Acquired from the Jaguars for a fifth- and sixth-round draft pick at the start of the week, Bigsby was not yet part of the Eagles’ offensive gameplan. His only snaps came on special teams. He’ll compete with Will Shipley (ribs) and AJ Dillon for the backup role behind Saquon Barkley once he’s more integrated with his new team.</p> <h4 id="cade-otton-te">Cade Otton (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Otton had a 92 percent snap share (66 snaps), making the fact he didn’t see so much as a single target all the more alarming. The fourth-year tight end has now gone without a catch in two of the first three games despite the team’s multiple absences at wide receiver, but he would seem to have a good chance of being much more involved in a Week 4 home showdown against the Eagles, especially if Mike Evans (hamstring) sits out the contest.</p> <h4 id="emeka-egbuka-wr">Emeka Egbuka (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The rookie continued an impressive start to his NFL career, leading the Buccaneers in catches and yards while tying Mike Evans in targets. Evans left the game in the fourth quarter with a hamstring injury, and Chris Godwin (ankle) may not be ready to make his season debut next week, which could leave Egbuka and his 14-181-3 line on 21 targets through three contests poised for massive volume in Week 4 against an Eagles secondary that just got torched for 11 catches and 112 yards by the Rams’ Puka Nacua.</p> <h4 id="calvin-ridley-wr">Calvin Ridley (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Titans continue to prioritize Ridley in their offense, as he led the team in targets Sunday. However, he struggled with drops and lacked rapport with Cam Ward, which led to the poor showing. Ridley has now been held to under 30 receiving yards in two of three games this season despite earning a minimum of six targets in every contest.</p> <h4 id="deebo-samuel-wr">Deebo Samuel (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> In the wake of Austin Ekeler (Achilles) being lost for the season, Samuel mixed in as part of a backfield committee, but he saw little volume either on the ground or through the air. The lack of usage may have been due largely to the fact that the Commanders were never seriously threatened in the second half, but having Marcus Mariota under center in place of Jayden Daniels (knee) likely had an impact as well. Daniels could return for a Week 4 clash with the Falcons, but even if Mariota is at QB again, Samuel could be relied on heavily if Terry McLaurin (quadriceps) is out or limited.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_3_2025_ARV_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_3_2025_ARV_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week3"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Big Titi Energy Week 3 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-3-BTE/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Big Titi Energy Week 3 Report"/><published>2025-09-23T18:35:42+00:00</published><updated>2025-09-23T18:35:42+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-3-BTE</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-3-BTE/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Big Titi Energy Lost against Michael’s Managable Team 81.26-148.67<br/> Current Standing: #12<br/> Playoff Chances: 7.3%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 77.7%<br/> Best Performer: Kenneth Walker III (17.50 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="dalton-kincaid-te">Dalton Kincaid (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Kincaid led the Bills in receptions, receiving yards and targets on the night, rounding out his productive performance with a 20-yard outstretched touchdown grab in the first quarter that answered Miami’s early score. The athletic tight end has arguably been Buffalo’s most consistent game-to-game pass catcher for fantasy purposes through the first three games, as he’ll take a 13-151-2 line on 16 targets into a Week 4 home matchup against the Saints on Sunday, Sept. 28.</p> <h4 id="dj-moore-wr">DJ Moore (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Moore continued to be overshadowed by Rome Odunze, but he also lost out to Luther Burden in the blowout win. Moore still finished second on the team in targets, but his longest gain went for only 12 yards as he was targeted exclusively in short areas of the field. He saved his day with a four-yard touchdown catch late in the fourth quarter, his first trip to the end zone this season. Nevertheless, Moore has yet to see more than six targets in a game and has topped 50 receiving yards only once in three contests.</p> <h4 id="tee-higgins-wr">Tee Higgins (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Higgins barely saw Jake Browning look his way, as he logged more targets than only Cam Grandy and Mitchell Tinsley. The valued No. 2 wideout’s muted performance was naturally part of a miserable day for the Bengals’ offense overall, but better days should be ahead for both Browning and Higgins the more the former settles in under center. However, another tough matchup awaits in Week 4, when Cincinnati travels west to face the Broncos on Monday night, Sept. 29.</p> <h4 id="jake-browning-qb">Jake Browning (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Vikings jumped on Browning and the Bengals early, establishing a 14-0 lead through one quarter, and the veteran backup was never able to get his side of the ball fully on track. Browning ultimately took three sacks and tossed a pair of picks in Minnesota territory, the first of which was a pick-six in the first quarter. Browning has demonstrated the ability to play appreciably better than he demonstrated Sunday in a game that got out of hand due largely to turnovers, but atoning for the poor performance in Week 4 could be a heavy lift with a road trip to Denver for a Monday night, Sept. 29 date with the Broncos on tap.</p> <h4 id="jerome-ford-rb">Jerome Ford (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Ford didn’t get a carry for the first time in three weeks, but he has emerged as a primary target out of the backfield. He actually caught a fifth pass, but the play was negated by a holding penalty. Ford has 10 official targets over the last two weeks and 11 for the season. That’s tied with Dylan Sampson for the lead among Cleveland’s running backs, but Sampson went untargeted Sunday and has just three over the last two weeks. Ford was not used in the return game after returning six kicks in Week 2.</p> <h4 id="christian-kirk-wr">Christian Kirk (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Making his season/team debut, Kirk finished tied for third in receptions on another relatively difficult day for the Texans’ passing game. The veteran wideout was projected to serve as an effective short-to-mid-range complement to Nico Collins coming into the season, and now that Kirk is finally healthy, he’ll have a chance to start building chemistry with C.J. Stroud on an ongoing basis and likely provide Houston’s struggling air attack with a boost. Kirk next takes aim at the Titans’ inconsistent defense in a Week 4 home matchup.</p> <h4 id="cj-stroud-qb">C.J. Stroud (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Another sluggish day for the Texans offense saw Stroud toss his second and third interceptions of the season on the Jaguars’ 19 and four-yard line, respectively, in the second half. The second pick was a true back-breaker, as it came with 27 seconds remaining and Houston seemingly on the verge of going in for a game-tying touchdown. Stroud and his teammates on that side of the ball have looked out of sorts through three games, albeit against the tough defenses of the Rams, Buccaneers and Jaguars. Stroud will look to rebound in a Week 4 home matchup against the vulnerable Titans defense.</p> <h4 id="jj-mccarthy-qb">J.J. McCarthy (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Out <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Beyond McCarthy’s lack of availability Week 4, O’Connell also noted, “First and foremost, he’s got to get healthy. And then, I don’t think it’s one of those things where it’s, hey, he’s healthy the night before a game, we’re going to throw him out there and say, ‘Hey, go figure it out’ type of thing.” McCarthy emerged from a Week 2 loss to the Falcons with a high right ankle sprain and sat out this past Sunday’s win against the Bengals, which allowed Carson Wentz to lead the Vikings offense. Overall, Wentz didn’t commit a turnover and compiled 173 yards and two touchdowns on 14-for-20 passing. Wentz will continue operating as the starter for as long as McCarthy is sidelined and potentially even when he’s healthy, per O’Connell.</p> <h4 id="demario-douglas-wr">DeMario Douglas (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Douglas was out-snapped by fellow WRs Kayshon Boutte (56 snaps, two catches), Mack Hollins (46 snaps, four catches) and Stefon Diggs (39 snaps, three catches). Through the Patriots’ first three games, Douglas has caught five of his 13 targets for 13 yards and a TD and added four yards on one carry. Based on his production so far, Douglas is a speculative fantasy option at best unless he picks up the pace.</p> <h4 id="juwan-johnson-te">Juwan Johnson (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Johnson continued his early-season surge with another strong PPR effort despite his team suffering yet another loss. The veteran tight end has been an early surprise in fantasy, racking up 19 receptions on 29 targets for 176 yards and a touchdown through three contests. Johnson has quickly become a must-start option at such a shallow fantasy position heading into next Sunday’s road tilt against the Bills.</p> <h4 id="breece-hall-rb">Breece Hall (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The fourth-year RB posted disappointing numbers for the second straight week as Hall drifted closer to a full timeshare with Braelon Allen, seeing 13 touches to the younger back’s eight and barely out-producing him (52 yards to 47). Hall is still looking for his first TD of 2025, and through three contests he’s averaging 4.1 yards per carry on 38 totes. He’ll try to break out in Week 4 against a Dolphins defense that just got gashed for 108 yards and a touchdown by the Bills’ James Cook.</p> <h4 id="dallas-goedert-te">Dallas Goedert (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Goedert returned from a one-game absence and was the odd-man out on a strong offensive day for the Eagles. He did manage to make his lone reception of the day count by hauling in a 33-yard touchdown early in the third quarter as he split the Rams’ defense down the middle of the field. Though it’s come in very different ways, Goedert has had a productive start to the season after tallying seven catches in Week 1.</p> <h4 id="zach-charbonnet-rb">Zach Charbonnet (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Charbonnet didn’t practice last week due to a foot injury that left him listed as doubtful for Sunday’s game against the Saints. He predictably was included among the Seahawks’ inactives for Week 3, but his estimated activity level Monday indicates that he’s on pace to return to action Thursday at Arizona. Ultimately, Wednesday’s practice report will reveal whether or not Charbonnet has a designation for that contest, but if he returns to action, he’ll likely resume his timeshare with Kenneth Walker out of Seattle’s backfield.</p> <h4 id="kenneth-walker-iii-rb">Kenneth Walker III (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Walker punched in a pair of short touchdowns early on to help build a 38-6 lead over the Saints at halftime. The 24-year-old has bounced back nicely from a Week 1 dud against San Francisco (10-20-0), generating 143 rushing yards and three touchdowns in the two starts since. The Seahawks were without the services of RB Zach Charbonnet (foot) on Sunday, and a similar situation could unfold in Week 4 with a short practice week on tap ahead of Thursday Night Football. Walker would still generate flex value if Charbonnet is able to suit up against Arizona, but the former would see a huge boost in fantasy value if his backfield mate remains sidelined.</p> <h4 id="terry-mclaurin-wr">Terry McLaurin (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> McLaurin posted a 3-74-0 receiving line on four targets across 35 offensive snaps against the Raiders this past Sunday but had to leave the game with the quad injury in the second half. If McLaurin is unable to play against Atlanta, the Commanders could be down to Deebo Samuel, Luke McCaffrey, Jaylin Lane and Chris Moore at wide receiver, as Noah Brown (groin) didn’t practice at all last week after being injured in Week 2 against Green Bay.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_3_2025_BTE_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_3_2025_BTE_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week3"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Emma’s Excellent Team Week 3 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-3-EET/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Emma’s Excellent Team Week 3 Report"/><published>2025-09-23T18:35:42+00:00</published><updated>2025-09-23T18:35:42+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-3-EET</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-3-EET/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Emma’s Excellent Team Lost against Game of Zones - House Hamlin 73.63-114.94<br/> Current Standing: #11<br/> Playoff Chances: 18.7%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 83.1%<br/> Best Performer: Courtland Sutton (20.80 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

In Conner’s stead, Benson will get the first chance to lead the Cardinals backfield as he looks to build upon the 29 touches for 170 yards from scrimmage and no touchdowns that he’s accumulated through the first three games of the season. Aside from Benson, a 2024 third-round pick, Arizona’s healthy RBs on the active roster are Emari Demercado and Bam Knight, while Michael Carter resides on the practice squad.</p> <h4 id="drake-london-wr">Drake London (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> On a day when the host Panthers delivered a shocking thumping to the Falcons, London managed to cobble together a serviceable, albeit uninspiring, fantasy day. The talented wideout led Atlanta in both receptions and receiving yards while checking in second in targets, and the yardage tally tied London’s season high. While Michael Penix took a step back Sunday, London will aim to help the second-year signal-caller atone during a Week 4 home matchup against a Commanders defense that’s been prone to allowing chunk plays through the air early this season.</p> <h4 id="justice-hill-rb">Justice Hill (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Baltimore’s run game was uncharacteristically shut down by the Browns on Sunday as Hill and Derrick Henry combined for 14 carries and 30 yards. Hill managed to contribute in the passing game with three grabs after being held to just one three-yard reception in the opener. His playing time remained in line with his Week 1 total as he played 22 snaps. His usage can vary week-to-week, but Hill’s snap share sits in the 40 percent range.</p> <h4 id="joshua-palmer-wr">Joshua Palmer (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> After being targeted nine times Week 1 and three times Week 2, Palmer logged just one target (for five yards) Thursday. While a bounce-back is possible as soon as Week 4 against the Saints, fellow WRs Elijah Moore and Tyrell Shavers combined for five targets versus Miami, while Keon Coleman (45) and Khalil Shakir (42) paced the team in terms of Week 3 snaps.</p> <h4 id="courtland-sutton-wr">Courtland Sutton (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Sutton bounced back nicely from last week’s one-catch dud, ripping off a 52-yard touchdown grab while posting his first 100-plus yard performance of the season. The 29-year-old re-established himself as Bo Nix’s favorite option, finishing with four more targets than Marvin Mims and rookie Troy Franklin. Sutton will carry a healthy 13-185-2 receiving line into a Week 4 matchup against the Bengals on Monday Night Football.</p> <h4 id="trevor-lawrence-qb">Trevor Lawrence (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Lawrence averaged just 5.6 yards per attempt while failing to throw a touchdown for the first time in three games this season. The 2021 first overall pick spread the ball around to nine different pass catchers overall, and he leveraged another impressive performance by his defense to help the Jaguars garner their second win of the season. To date, Lawrence has concerningly completed just 55.8 of his pass attempts in head coach Liam Coen’s typically QB-friendly offense, and he draws another tough matchup in a Week 4 road clash against the 49ers.</p> <h4 id="hollywood-brown-wr">Hollywood Brown (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Brown’s monster usage in Week 1 (16 targets) appears to have been an anomaly after the wideout averaged 5.5 targets in the two games since. The speedy receiver did draw a crucial pass interference flag on a deep shot in the waning moments of the first half that allowed the Chiefs to sneak in a field goal before the break. Xavier Worthy (shoulder) and Rashee Rice (suspension) remained out, with the former having a chance to return against the Ravens next Sunday. Brown will continue filling in as one of Patrick Mahomes’ top options until both projected starters have returned to action.</p> <h4 id="jakobi-meyers-wr">Jakobi Meyers (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> After seeing double-digit targets in each of the first two games of 2025, Meyers saw his volume crater in Week 3 as Tre Tucker instead got more of Geno Smith’s attention. Meyers has still topped 60 receiving yards in three straight contests en route to a 17-228-0 line on 26 targets, and there could be plenty of volume to go around in Week 4 against a Bears defense that has been one of the worst units in the NFL to begin the year.</p> <h4 id="rashid-shaheed-wr">Rashid Shaheed (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Shaheed finished third in targets, receptions and yardage for the Saints in a one-sided affair Sunday. The 26-year-old has proven to be a solid fantasy option for those in deeper formats, averaging 4.7 receptions and 42.3 yards through three weeks. Expect Shaheed to continue providing a solid floor as New Orleans’ No. 2 receiver in a road matchup against the Bills next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="saquon-barkley-rb">Saquon Barkley (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Eagles were chasing the Rams for nearly the entire game, though volume wasn’t Barkley’s primary problem. Instead, he was held to only 2.6 yards per rush with a long gain of just 12 yards. Barkley did manage to salvage his day in leagues that reward receptions, as he hauled in four targets for the second time this season. Barkley has yet to hit 100 yards from scrimmage and also has zero 20-yard gains on the ground through three contests.</p> <h4 id="brock-purdy-qb">Brock Purdy (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable</p> <h4 id="tony-pollard-rb">Tony Pollard (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Titans were forced into a pass-heavy game script by falling behind by three scores early in the third quarter. That limited Pollard’s chances on the ground, though he managed a one-yard touchdown plunge a few minutes of game time later. Pollard has found ways to be productive – he topped 85 yards from scrimmage in each of his first two games – but the Tennessee offense is likely to continue to limit his upside.</p> <h4 id="zach-ertz-te">Zach Ertz (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The veteran tight end tied Terry McLaurin (quadriceps) and Luke McCaffrey for the team lead in receptions, as the Commanders did most of their damage on the ground with Marcus Mariota at quarterback instead of Jayden Daniels (knee). Ertz also saw his two-game TD streak end, and he sports a 12-128-2 line on 16 targets to begin the season. If Daniels is able to return in Week 4 against the Falcons, Ertz seems likely to have his target volume perk back up.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_3_2025_EET_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_3_2025_EET_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week3"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Game of Zones - House Hamlin Week 3 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-3-HMB/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Game of Zones - House Hamlin Week 3 Report"/><published>2025-09-23T18:35:42+00:00</published><updated>2025-09-23T18:35:42+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-3-HMB</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-3-HMB/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Game of Zones: House Hamlin Won against Emma’s Excellent Team 114.94-73.63<br/> Current Standing: #1<br/> Playoff Chances: 86.0%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 88.7%<br/> Best Performer: Josh Allen (34.02 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="james-conner-rb">James Conner (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Out <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Conner exited Sunday’s loss at San Francisco early in the third quarter with what initially was termed an ankle injury, which was severe enough for Adam Schefter of ESPN to report that the running back’s 2025 campaign was over. Now that Conner’s coach has confirmed as much as well as the true nature of the injury, he’ll end the season with 32 carries for 95 yards and one touchdown and eight catches (on nine targets) for 38 yards and another score in three games. Trey Benson is expected to lead Arizona’s backfield moving forward, but Emari Demercado also should get the occasional rep on game days.</p> <h4 id="zay-flowers-wr">Zay Flowers (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> After coming into the night with an impressive 14-218-1 line that he’d generated over the first two games of the season, Flowers crashed down to earth in the interconference clash. The 2023 first-round pick’s downturn was precipitated by a significant drop in targets, as he drew just three looks from Lamar Jackson after seeing a combined 20 over the first pair of contests. Flowers is likely to be much more involved in another potential wire-to-wire battle versus the Chiefs on the road in Week 4.</p> <h4 id="rashod-bateman-wr">Rashod Bateman (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Bateman finished second in receptions and receiving yards for the Ravens behind Mark Andrews, while also setting the pace in targets. Bateman recorded his first touchdown of the season on a three-yard grab just before halftime, and the fifth-year pro has now upped his yardage total over that of the prior game in consecutive contests heading into a Week 4 road showdown with the Chiefs on Sunday afternoon.</p> <h4 id="derrick-henry-rb">Derrick Henry (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Henry was coming off a disappointing 11-carry, 23-yard performance against a tough Browns defense, so in that regard, Monday’s production was encouraging on the surface. The multi-time Pro Bowler also recorded his third rushing touchdown of the season on a 28-yard run in the first quarter that answered an early Lions score. However, that was easily overshadowed by Henry’s second critical fourth-quarter fumble over the first three games of the season, as he was stripped of the ball at his own 22-yard line with 8:31 remaining and Baltimore trying to overcome a 28-24 deficit. Detroit was able to add three more critical points as a result of the highly favorable field position, helping lead to the victory. Henry and his teammates won’t have much time to dwell on Monday night’s outcome, however, as a road trip to Kansas City for a Week 4 showdown with the Chiefs awaits this coming Sunday.</p> <h4 id="josh-allen-qb">Josh Allen (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Allen finished with a sparkling 134.1 QB rating in the divisional win, which may have been more tightly contested than initially expected. As a result, the star signal-caller was appreciably more involved through the air than during a comfortable Week 2 win against the Jets, completing passes to nine different targets overall. Allen’s first two scoring tosses went to tight ends Dalton Kincaid (20 yards) and Jackson Hawes (five yards), the latter a nifty heave while on the run. Allen closed out his night with a 15-yard strike to Khalil Shakir midway through the fourth quarter to snap a 21-21 tie, and he’ll head into a Week 4 home date against the Saints on Sunday, Sept. 28 with an unblemished 5:0 TD:INT and career-best 69.7 percent completion rate through his first three contests.</p> <h4 id="cedric-tillman-wr">Cedric Tillman (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Tillman, who had 15 targets and two touchdowns through the first two weeks, was kept out of the end zone for the first time and had his fewest targets of the season. The production drop in Week 3 has more to do with Cleveland’s sputtering offense and shouldn’t be seen as a designed plan to reduce Tillman’s role. He’s been on the field for 86 percent of the offensive snaps, second only to Jerry Jeudy (86.5 percent) among the Browns wide receivers.</p> <h4 id="amon-ra-st-brown-wr">Amon-Ra St. Brown (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> St. Brown carried over the momentum from his standout three-score game against the Bears last week into Monday’s tilt, where he posted prototypical WR1 numbers on the road against the Ravens. The 25-year-old shook his assignment with a double move in the third quarter to hit pay dirt for the fourth time this season. The star wideout also chipped in an assist that will not show up in the box score when he pitched the ball to Jahmyr Gibbs on a fourth-down option play that resulted in a touchdown for his teammate. St. Brown will boast a pristine 20-237-4 receiving line heading into a Week 4 matchup against Cleveland on Sunday.</p> <h4 id="sam-laporta-te">Sam LaPorta (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> LaPorta remained somewhat quiet Week 3, finishing third on the team in catches, targets and receiving yards. The tight end has still yet to find the end zone, though he’s seen three red-zone targets over three games. Through three weeks, he’s compiled 13 receptions (on 17 targets) for 138 yards. LaPorta will look to find pay dirt Week 4 against the Browns, who have allowed two touchdowns to tight ends so far this season.</p> <h4 id="jordan-love-qb">Jordan Love (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Love’s final stat line – not to mention the final score – both hint plenty at what type of day it was for the Packers offense, and additional insight can be gleaned from the fact Love was sacked five times and hit seven times overall. The talented signal-caller had a tight circle of six targets overall in his first full game of 2025 without Jayden Reed (IR-collarbone/foot), and his interception at his own 29-yard line with just over three minutes remaining set the Browns up for a game-tying touchdown. Love has thrown for under 200 yards in two of his first three games, but he takes an impressive 5:1 TD:INT into a Week 4 Sunday night road matchup against the Cowboys.</p> <h4 id="tucker-kraft-te">Tucker Kraft (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The knee injury Kraft suffered in Thursday’s practice didn’t prevent the talented tight end from suiting up, but the Packers’ passing game as a whole was frequently overwhelmed by a ferocious Browns defense that brought Jordan Love down five times and picked him off once. Kraft’s totals were in stark contrast to his breakout 6-124-1 line against the Commanders in Week 2, but he’ll likely be healthier when the Packers pay a visit to the Cowboys for a Week 4 showdown next Sunday night.</p> <h4 id="juju-smith-schuster-wr">JuJu Smith-Schuster (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Smith-Schuster saw regular run on offense Sunday with Xavier Worthy (shoulder) out and Rashee Rice suspended, but he was unable to capitalize on the increase in opportunity. With Worthy potentially returning to action this Sunday against the Giants, Smith-Schuster is a candidate to see a reduction in snaps.</p> <h4 id="najee-harris-rb">Najee Harris (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Out <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Harris will need to undergo surgery and miss the remainder of the season due to the severity of the injury he suffered Week 3 against Denver. The 27-year-old running back inked a one-year contract with Los Angeles for the 2025 campaign, positioning him to hit free agency next offseason. With Harris done for the year, rookie first-round pick Omarion Hampton becomes clearly entrenched as the No. 1 backfield option for a high-scoring Chargers offense, and 2024 sixth-rounder Kimani Vidal becomes a likely candidate to be brought off the practice squad as additional depth alongside return-game specialist Hassan Haskins.</p> <h4 id="keenan-allen-wr">Keenan Allen (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Allen made a terrific adjustment on a broken play in the fourth quarter, jumping through the defender to snare a 20-yard touchdown that tied the game. If it wasn’t clear through the first two weeks, it’s obvious now that the veteran is clearly Justin Herbert’s preferred target – especially when a play breaks down – and the duo’s uncanny connection has only become more potent with the emergence of Quentin Johnston (six catches on 10 targets for 89 yards) alongside the reliable Ladd McConkey. Allen has now led the team in targets for three straight weeks and continues to be a key piece of dominant offense.</p> <h4 id="sterling-shepard-wr">Sterling Shepard (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Shepard put together his best game of the season, finishing just five yards short of rookie Emeka Egbuka’s team-high total. The veteran slot receiver has an 11-153-0 line on 15 targets through Tampa Bay’s first three games while taking advantage of the absence of Chris Godwin (ankle), but even if Godwin is ready to make his season debut in Week 4 against the Eagles, Shepard’s role may not decrease immediately as Mike Evans left Sunday’s win in the fourth quarter with a hamstring injury.</p> <h4 id="cam-ward-qb">Cam Ward (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Hardegree was hired as Callahan’s QBs coach ahead of the 2024 season and has very limited experience calling offensive plays in the NFL, only doing it with the Raiders in 2023 after coach Josh McDaniels and OC Joe Lombardi were fired during the season. However, the Titans simply needed to make a change. Entering Week 4, Tennessee is 31st in yards per game, 32nd in touchdowns scored, 32nd in passing yards and 32nd in sacks allowed. There’s simply nowhere to go but up for the Titans. Averaging a mere 8.4 fantasy points per game through three weeks, rookie No. 1 overall pick Cam Ward is fantasy’s QB36.</p> <h4 id="jacory-croskey-merritt-rb">Jacory Croskey-Merritt (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Commanders rolled with a committee in the wake of Austin Ekeler (Achilles) being lost for the season, and Croskey-Merritt scored one of the team’s three rushing TDs on the afternoon, with QB Marcus Mariota and Jeremy McNichols getting the others. McNichols’ 60-yard touchdown stole the show, but Chris Rodriguez led the backfield with 11 carries, and JCM made his impact with a one-yard plunge in the third quarter. The rookie has 125 rushing yards and two TDs on an impressive 5.7 yards per carry through his first three NFL games, but given the offense’s success in this one, he seems unlikely to get a big increase in volume in Week 4 against the Falcons.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_3_2025_HMB_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_3_2025_HMB_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week3"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Mama Daughter Duo Week 3 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-3-JST/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mama Daughter Duo Week 3 Report"/><published>2025-09-23T18:35:42+00:00</published><updated>2025-09-23T18:35:42+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-3-JST</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-3-JST/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Mama Daughter Duo Won against Americas Team 157.16-144.61<br/> Current Standing: #4<br/> Playoff Chances: 70.5%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 91.3%<br/> Best Performer: Caleb Williams (37.62 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="michael-penix-jr-qb">Michael Penix Jr. (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Over his first five NFL starts, Penix hadn’t come close to scuffling in the manner he did Sunday, and the fact the opponent was a Panthers squad that had struggled on defense over the first two games made his poor effort all the more alarming. Penix threw multiple interceptions for the first time as a pro, and he was under 200 passing yards for the second straight game. While the low passing volume was by design in a dominant Week 2 win over the Vikings, Sunday’s downturn was directly correlated to how well the opposing defense stymied his efforts. Penix and the Falcons will welcome the Commanders for a Week 4 matchup next Sunday, a game that could pit the second-year signal caller against fellow 2024 first-rounder Jayden Daniels if the latter can play through his knee injury.</p> <h4 id="dandre-swift-rb">D’Andre Swift (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Swift was one of only a few poor performers for Chicago on Sunday. He was unable to find much running room throughout the game and was held below 50 rushing yards for the first time this season. Instead, Swift made his impact as a receiver, picking up 41 yards after a short dump-off midway through the second quarter. Swift remains the clear leader of the Bears’ backfield, as he out-touched Kyle Monangai 16-7 and has found the end zone in each of the last two contests.</p> <h4 id="rome-odunze-wr">Rome Odunze (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Odunze made an immediate impact, hauling in a 35-yard touchdown on Chicago’s first offensive possession. He was relatively quiet thereafter, though he still managed a pair of additional receptions for 13 and 14 yards. Odunze has found the end zone in every game this season while surpassing 60 yards in each of his last two contests.</p> <h4 id="caleb-williams-qb">Caleb Williams (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Williams has consistently looked sharp during the scripted portions of Chicago’s game plans to begin the season, which remained the case Sunday when he connected for a 35-yard touchdown with Rome Odunze on the opening drive. He carried his strong performance through the entire game, however, and matched his career high with four passing scores while also completing four passes of more than 30 yards. In addition to the explosiveness, Williams didn’t take a sack or turn the ball over in one of the most well-rounded showings of his young career.</p> <h4 id="jayden-reed-wr">Jayden Reed (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Injured Reserve <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Reed was already playing through a Jones fracture in his foot when he sustained a broken collarbone early during a Week 2 win against the Commanders. He’s since undergone surgeries for both health concerns and is facing a 6-to-8 week recovery timetable, meaning a move to IR was inevitable for Reed. For at least the next two games, the Packers’ receiving corps will be composed of Matthew Golden, Romeo Doubs, Dontayvion Wicks, Savion Williams and Malik Heath, while Christian Watson (knee) will be eligible for activation from the reserve/PUP list as soon as Week 6 following a Week 5 bye.</p> <h4 id="travis-kelce-te">Travis Kelce (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Kelce took a back seat to Kansas City’s starting trio of receivers on Sunday Night Football, all three of which finished with more yards than the star tight end. Backup tight end Noah Gray even got in on the action, finishing with a season high three catches in the win. Kelce would gladly trade a personal down game for the team’s first win, but fantasy managers have to feel underwhelmed with Sunday’s results. Kelce will look to be more involved in a potentially higher-scoring affair against the Ravens next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="hunter-henry-te">Hunter Henry (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The veteran tight end’s connection with QB Drake Maye was just about the only thing working for the Patriots on the afternoon. No other New England player caught more than four passes (Mack Hollins) or had more than 38 receiving yards (Rhamondre Stevenson), and the backfield combined to lose an incredible four fumbles – two by Stevenson, and one each by Maye and Antonio Gibson. Henry will take 13-165-2 line on 22 targets through three games into a Week 4 meeting with a Panthers defense that has looked vulnerable to TEs so far.</p> <h4 id="chris-olave-wr">Chris Olave (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Olave wound up playing pitch-and-catch with QB Spencer Rattler in the blowout loss, resulting in a longest reception of nine yards despite the duo connecting on 10 passes Sunday. The 25-year-old Olave still produced strong results for those in PPR formats, but he remains scoreless through the Saints’ first three contests. The lack of touchdown potential limits Olave’s fantasy ceiling in standard formats heading into next Sunday’s tilt against the Bills.</p> <h4 id="will-shipley-rb">Will Shipley (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable</p> <h4 id="devonta-smith-wr">DeVonta Smith (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Eagles were forced into a more aggressive offensive game plan after they fell behind by three scores early in the fourth quarter. Smith and A.J. Brown both benefited, with the former chipping in as a reliable target closer to the line of scrimmage. Smith also provided the game-winning touchdown on a four-yard out with just under two minutes remaining in the game. Smith’s production will remain volatile, but he should have strong performances when the Eagles are forced to take to the air more often.</p> <h4 id="jalen-hurts-qb">Jalen Hurts (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Hurts hadn’t produced much as a passer through two weeks of the season, but the Eagles fell behind by 19 points early in the third quarter. He went on to record passing touchdowns of 33, nine and four yards in an impressive comeback effort while also completing three additional passes of 20 yards. Contrary to his passing performances, Hurts has consistently made an impact as a rusher through three games this season, and that also continued in the win, highlighted by a tush-push touchdown midway through the first quarter. It may not always be in the most conventional way, but Hurts continues to produce as an elite fantasy quarterback.</p> <h4 id="kaleb-johnson-rb">Kaleb Johnson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Johnson saw minimal snaps over the first two weeks of the regular season, but he was held out Sunday following last week’s error on special teams that led to a Seattle touchdown. Jaylen Warren continued to serve as the lead back against New England, playing 80 percent of the Steelers’ offensive snaps, while Kenneth Gainwell was on the field for 26 percent. The Steelers invested a third-round pick in Johnson, but the rookie has some work to do if he hopes to carve out a fantasy-relevant role.</p> <h4 id="dk-metcalf-wr">DK Metcalf (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The veteran wideout continues to build chemistry with new quarterback Aaron Rodgers, bringing down a 12-yard jump ball early in the second quarter – a score that moved Rodgers past Brett Favre into fourth place on the NFL’s career passing TD list. Metcalf has found the end zone in back-to-back games, but he isn’t yet seeing the target volume as a Steeler that he was accustomed to in Seattle. He’ll take a 10-135-2 line on 17 targets into a Week 4 clash with the Vikings.</p> <h4 id="christian-mccaffrey-rb">Christian McCaffrey (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> McCaffrey continued to shoulder the load for a shorthanded 49ers offense that was without starters Brock Purdy (toe/shoulder), George Kittle (hamstring) and Jauan Jennings (ankle) in Week 3. CMC wound up handling a whopping 27 combined touches en route to his third 100-plus yard game in as many tries this season. Opposing defenses have been stacking the box against San Francisco in the two games Mac Jones has started, resulting in less running lanes for McCaffrey and a subpar average of 3.6 yards per carry. Fortunately for fantasy managers, the dual-threat superstar’s ability as a pass catcher (25-213-1) has helped offset his slow start on the ground. McCaffrey should check in as an elite RB1 for Week 4 when the 49ers host the Jaguars next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="rachaad-white-rb">Rachaad White (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> White was coming off a 10-carry, 65-yard, one-touchdown effort against the Texans, so his downturn Sunday, which came on his second-highest snap count of the season (20), was both noteworthy and disappointing. The fourth-year back was relegated to a much smaller role in the hard-fought win, and White has also been just a minor participant in the air attack through three games with a scant four targets. White and Bucs draw a tough matchup in Week 4, as the defending champion Eagles come to town on Sunday afternoon.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_3_2025_JST_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_3_2025_JST_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week3"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Mcconky Donkeys Week 3 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-3-KTT/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mcconky Donkeys Week 3 Report"/><published>2025-09-23T18:35:42+00:00</published><updated>2025-09-23T18:35:42+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-3-KTT</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-3-KTT/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Mcconky Donkeys Won against Third Time’s the Charm? 88.53-85.30<br/> Current Standing: #7<br/> Playoff Chances: 47.5%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 86.7%<br/> Best Performer: Baker Mayfield (19.22 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="tyler-allgeier-rb">Tyler Allgeier (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> After 26 rushing attempts through the first two weeks, Allgeier’s muted role was a product of Sunday’s game script, as the Falcons got in an early hole and tried to pass their way out of it. Allgeier is still the top backup behind Bijan Robinson, despite undrafted rookie Nathan Carter getting more touches against Carolina. All of Carter’s attempts came on Atlanta’s final drive, and he fumbled on his last carry.</p> <h4 id="david-njoku-te">David Njoku (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Njoku led the Browns across the board in receptions, receiving yards and targets in the narrow upset win. The veteran tight end was productive relative to how quiet a day it was overall for Cleveland’s passing attack, and Njoku encouragingly retains a steady role for the time being despite the clear talent and readiness of rookie position mate Harold Fannin. Njoku will take a 12-117-0 line on 18 targets into a Week 4 road matchup against the Lions.</p> <h4 id="evan-engram-te">Evan Engram (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable</p> <h4 id="troy-franklin-wr">Troy Franklin (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Franklin followed up the best performance of his young career against the Colts in Week 2 with an absolute stinker against the Chargers. The 2024 fourth-round selection still finished in a tie for second in team targets with Marvin Mims, but both youngsters paled in comparison to No. 1 wideout Courtland Sutton’s monster 6-118-1 receiving line Sunday. Franklin still provides some good upside in a soft matchup against the Bengals next Monday if managers can look past his dud in Week 3.</p> <h4 id="brian-thomas-jr-wr">Brian Thomas Jr. (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Thomas endured another lackluster afternoon on a day when Trevor Lawrence continued to struggle with play-to-play consistency. However, the talented second-year wideout still managed to finish second in receiving yards on the afternoon for Jacksonville courtesy of a critical and team-long 46-yard catch with two minutes remaining to set up a game-winning 10-yard touchdown run by Travis Etienne on the next play. While the noteworthy reception propped up Thomas’ fantasy day to an extent, he’ll still take just a 7-115-1 line on 25 targets through three games into a Week 4 road matchup against the 49ers next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="isiah-pacheco-rb">Isiah Pacheco (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Pacheco was far more efficient with his 10 carries in Sunday’s win compared to the paltry 22 rushing yards he managed in Week 2. The positive news ends there, as backup Kareem Hunt also received 10 carries while punching in Kansas City’s only rushing touchdown on the evening. It appears a timeshare has developed in the Chiefs’ backfield, limiting Pacheco to a flex option at best against the Ravens next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="rashee-rice-wr">Rashee Rice (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Suspension <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Rice won’t be eligible to practice while he remains suspended, but he can take part in meetings and stay involved with the team as he gears up for a return Week 7 versus the Raiders on Oct. 19. The 0-2 Chiefs have solely missed Rice’s presence in the first two games of the season, with his absence being further magnified by the loss of fellow receiver Xavier Worthy (shoulder), who will be sidelined for a second straight game Sunday against the Giants after suffering a labrum tear three snaps into Kansas City’s Sept. 5 loss to the Chargers.</p> <h4 id="ladd-mcconkey-wr">Ladd McConkey (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> McConkey came up with a few critical chain-moving receptions but otherwise was kept in check for a third consecutive week. At this point it certainly seems like Keenan Allen (11 targets) has re-emerged as Justin Herbert’s favorite intermediate target, and the blossoming of third-year wide receiver Quentin Johnston into a bona fide option has carved into McConkey’s work more. Perhaps backing up some relevant fantasy concerns, the second-year wideout’s subpar yardage figure came despite Herbert attempting 47 passes, his most since 2023.</p> <h4 id="devon-achane-rb">De’Von Achane (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> After being held to 2.7 yards per carry by the Patriots in Week 2, Achane bounced back with an efficient effort on the ground that included two double-digit-yardage runs. He also followed up an 8-92-1 receiving line against New England with another busy night as a receiver, albeit in much more of a short-area role. Achane also saw rookie backfield mate Ollie Gordon convert a red-zone carry into a two-yard touchdown in the first quarter and log just three fewer carries, so the division of labor between the two will be worth monitoring in a Week 4 home matchup against the Jets on Monday night, Sept. 29.</p> <h4 id="darius-slayton-wr">Darius Slayton (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Giants couldn’t get much going with their passing offense, consistently targeting their top playmakers on deep passes. Slayton was the exception, as he saw the majority of his opportunities in the short areas of the field, with his longest gain going for 14 yards. While Slayton notched a season high in targets and receptions, both Malik Nabers and Wan’Dale Robinson will likely continue to be prioritized ahead of him in the offense.</p> <h4 id="wandale-robinson-wr">Wan’Dale Robinson (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Giants’ passing offense never got on track, limiting the production of the entire receiving corps. Robinson wasn’t immune, turning in season-worst marks in every statistical category. Many of his targets were tightly contested – including one that was picked off in double coverage – and Robinson was hit hard over the middle on his lone catch of the night late in the fourth quarter. Positively, he should continue to maintain a significant role in the offense in Week 4 against the Chargers.</p> <h4 id="aaron-rodgers-qb">Aaron Rodgers (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The veteran QB hit DK Metcalf for a 12-yard score in the second quarter and Calvin Austin with a game-winning 17-yarder with just over two minutes left in the fourth. Rodgers’ first touchdown of the afternoon also moved him past Brett Favre into fourth place on the NFL’s all-time list, and he finished the game with 510 – putting him 29 behind Peyton Manning for third place. Rodgers has a 7:3 TD:INT through his first three games as a Steeler, but he faces a tough test in Week 4 in Ireland against the Vikings.</p> <h4 id="mike-evans-wr">Mike Evans (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Doubtful <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Evans has been diagnosed with a moderate hamstring strain, according to Jenna Laine of ESPN.com, and she reports Evans will be sidelined three-to-four weeks. Pelissero notes that Evans’ latest hamstring injury isn’t as severe as the one that cost him four weeks last season. With Evans looking likely to miss Week 4 against the Eagles, first-round rookie Emeka Egbuka figures to vault into the WR1 role for the Bucs. There’s also a real chance Chris Godwin (ankle) makes his season debut against Philadelphia. Sterling Shepard should remain in the slot role for Tampa Bay. Tez Johnson and Ryan Miller are next up on the depth chart at wide receiver.</p> <h4 id="baker-mayfield-qb">Baker Mayfield (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Five Chase McLaughlin field goals and a 55-yard Jamel Dean INT return for a TD accounted for most of Tampa Bay’s scoring on the afternoon, but Mayfield did hit Mike Evans for a five-yard strike in the second quarter, giving him a 6:0 TD:INT to begin the season. Evans left the game with a hamstring injury late in the contest, but Chris Godwin (ankle) could be ready to return next week and rookie Emeka Egbuka has already made a significant impact through his first three NFL games, so Mayfield should still have dangerous downfield options available if his veteran No. 1 wideout is sidelined for a Week 4 tilt against the Eagles.</p> <h4 id="tyler-lockett-wr">Tyler Lockett (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Lockett has maintained a consistent snap rate across three games in Tennessee, playing nearly exactly half of the snaps in every contest. His performance in Sunday’s loss was his best of the year, highlighted by a long gain of 16 yards. Elic Ayomanor, Calvin Ridley and Chig Okonkwo are likely to remain prioritized ahead of Lockett in the offense, leaving him with limited upside on a weekly basis.</p> <h4 id="jayden-daniels-qb">Jayden Daniels (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_3_2025_KTT_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_3_2025_KTT_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week3"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Michael’s Managable Team Week 3 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-3-MMT/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Michael’s Managable Team Week 3 Report"/><published>2025-09-23T18:35:42+00:00</published><updated>2025-09-23T18:35:42+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-3-MMT</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-3-MMT/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Michael’s Managable Team Won against Big Titi Energy 148.67-81.26<br/> Current Standing: #2<br/> Playoff Chances: 80.0%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 85.1%<br/> Best Performer: Drake Maye (28.22 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="khalil-shakir-wr">Khalil Shakir (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The highlight of Shakir’s night was a tie-breaking 15-yard touchdown grab just after the halfway point of the fourth quarter, a play on which he went in motion before reversing course at the snap, catching a swing pass out of the backfield and scooting up the left side of the field into the end zone. Shakir’s receiving line represented a decent resurgence after he was limited to one catch for 12 yards against the Jets in Week 2, and he’ll remain one of Josh Allen’s primary targets in a Week 4 home matchup against the Saints on Sunday, Sept. 28.</p> <h4 id="harold-fannin-jr-te">Harold Fannin Jr. (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Tanin was tied for third in receptions and targets on the Browns for the afternoon while also garnering that slotting in receiving yards. It was Fannin’s quietest performance yet in his brief NFL career, but the rookie third-round pick is clearly a key component of the passing attack and could enjoy a bigger role in a Week 4 road matchup against the Lions for which Cleveland figures to have to remain aggressive on offense.</p> <h4 id="george-pickens-wr">George Pickens (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Pickens looked to be in for a very big performance after the departure of CeeDee Lamb (ankle), as he tallied a long catch of 21 yards and recorded a two-yard touchdown on a drive early in the second quarter. However, Pickens disappeared in the second half, with his only catch coming on a target from Joe Milton after the game was out of reach with four minutes remaining in the fourth quarter. Though Pickens padded his line in garbage time, he has exactly 68 yards with a touchdown in each of his last two games.</p> <h4 id="jake-ferguson-te">Jake Ferguson (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Ferguson commanded double-digit targets for the second consecutive week, though he was aided by the absence of CeeDee Lamb (ankle) in Sunday’s loss. Ferguson was targeted exclusively in the short areas of the field, with his longest gain of the day going for only 12 yards. While his showings haven’t been particularly explosive, Ferguson has a key role in the Dallas offense and has topped 75 receiving yards in consecutive contests.</p> <h4 id="jahmyr-gibbs-rb">Jahmyr Gibbs (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Gibbs was uncharacteristically inefficient on Monday Night Football, failing to crack the century mark in total yards despite handling a season-high 27 touches. Fortunately for managers, the fantasy stud still generated RB1 numbers by making his second and third trips to the end zone this season. David Montgomery (12-151-2 rushing line) also went off for Detroit in a shining example of a true timeshare that can produce two valuable assets on a weekly basis. Gibbs will face another stiff test defensively when the Lions host the Browns on Sunday.</p> <h4 id="woody-marks-rb">Woody Marks (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Marks logged just three fewer carries than backfield mate Nick Chubb, recording new career highs in rush attempts and rushing yards in the process. The rookie fourth-round pick also recorded a reception for the second consecutive game, and Marks could see his role continue to expand in a Week 4 home matchup against a Titans defense that allowed 102 rushing yards and three touchdowns to Jonathan Taylor on Sunday.</p> <h4 id="michael-pittman-jr-wr">Michael Pittman Jr. (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Daniel Jones distributed targets fairly evenly, as four Colts pass catchers were targeted at least four times. Pittman led the way in every statistic, highlighted by a 20-yard touchdown grab early in the third quarter and a 17-yard gain later in the same quarter. While Pittman has the potential to be the leader of the receiving corps, targets have been relatively evenly distributed through three weeks, so Pittman will need to rely on efficiency to deliver strong statistical lines in most weeks.</p> <h4 id="daniel-jones-qb">Daniel Jones (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Jones and the Colts enjoyed a three-possession lead by early in the third quarter, so he took to the air only nine times in the second half. The results when Jones took to the air remained strong, as he connected with Michael Pittman for a 20-yard touchdown, and he also completed seven passes of at least 15 yards. Jones failed to reach the end zone on the ground for the first time this season, though he continues to take care of the ball and lead an efficient Colts offense.</p> <h4 id="bhayshul-tuten-rb">Bhayshul Tuten (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The rookie No. 2 back logged nine fewer carries than Travis Etienne, but he matched his backfield mate in rushing touchdowns by recording a one-yard scoring run in the first quarter. Tuten also tallied a receiving TD in Week 2, and it’s clear he’ll continue to operate in a reliable complementary role as the Jaguars travel to face the 49ers in Week 4.</p> <h4 id="tre-harris-wr">Tre’ Harris (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Harris’ lone look from Justin Herbert came in the third quarter on a deep pass that fell incomplete. While Harris’ production was down from Week 2 against Las Vegas (two catches on three targets for 34 yards), he did see the field for 25 offensive snaps against Denver, and his playing time has increased over the first three games of the regular season. Next up for the Chargers is a Week 4 road bout against the Giants.</p> <h4 id="justin-herbert-qb">Justin Herbert (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Herbert made two absolutely stunning throws in this one, the latter connecting for a game-tying touchdown by Keenan Allen on a broken play in the fourth quarter. The sixth-year quarterback has been absolutely scintillating to start 2025 and does not appear to be flustered by any matchup. Even Herbert’s lone blemish came on a dropped pass that caromed back to the waiting arms of Broncos safety Brandon Jones. Sunday’s 47 pass attempts is tied for the Pro Bowler’s most since 2023 and seemed to be a byproduct of the team trying to claw back during a second half that largely saw the Chargers trailing.</p> <h4 id="davante-adams-wr">Davante Adams (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Adams beat Cooper DeJean deep down the left sideline late in the first quarter for a 44-yard touchdown. That accounted for the majority of Adams’ production on the day, as Puka Nacua overshadowed him. While Nacua’s role in the offense is likely to take some of the upside away from Adams, the latter has at least eight targets in all three of his games with the Rams.</p> <h4 id="tj-hockenson-te">T.J. Hockenson (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The veteran tight end had put together a quiet first two games of the season, mustering just a 4-27-0 line on seven targets. However, Hockenson tied for the team lead in receptions Sunday while checking in second in both receiving yards and targets as he worked with Carson Wentz for the first time. Hockenson also got into the end zone for the first time in 2025 on a five-yard grab late in the third quarter, and he’s slated to operate with Wentz as his quarterback again in next Sunday’s Week 4 matchup against the Steelers in Dublin, Ireland, since J.J. McCarthy (ankle) is expected to remain sidelined for that contest.</p> <h4 id="drake-maye-qb">Drake Maye (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The second-year QB found Hunter Henry for scores in the second and fourth quarters, but the rest of the Patriots’ offense struggled on the afternoon, especially on the ground – Maye led the team in rushing yards, and RBs Rhamondre Stevenson and Antonio Gibson combined to lose three fumbles. Maye has a 5:2 TD:INT through three games to begin his sophomore season, but in Week 4 he faces a Panthers defense that surprisingly just shut out the Falcons and fellow 2024 first-round pick Michael Penix.</p> <h4 id="alvin-kamara-rb">Alvin Kamara (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Kamara was stifled by Seattle’s defensive front from the get-go, resulting in the tailback’s worst per-carry average (2.3 YPC) in a single game since Week 7 against the Broncos last season (1.4 YPC). It was surprising to see the 29-year-old used so sparsely as a receiver in such a lopsided loss; perhaps the 38-6 deficit at halftime sucked the competitiveness from New Orleans’ sideline. Kamara remains the focal point of a struggling Saints offense despite posting his first dud through three weeks. Fantasy managers can expect heavy involvement from the dual-threat RB in a tough road matchup against Buffalo next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="ricky-pearsall-wr">Ricky Pearsall (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Pearsall was the last man standing for the 49ers’ starting passing offense with Brock Purdy (toe/shoulder), George Kittle (hamstring) and Jauan Jennings (ankle) all missing Sunday’s tilt. The 24-year-old Pearsall was up to the task, finishing as the club’s leading receiver while making several key drive-extending grabs. Expect Pearsall to continue spearheading San Francisco’s depleted receiver room – potentially with his starting QB back under center – against the Jaguars next Sunday.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_3_2025_MMT_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_3_2025_MMT_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week3"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Americas Team Week 3 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-3-RRT/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Americas Team Week 3 Report"/><published>2025-09-23T18:35:42+00:00</published><updated>2025-09-23T18:35:42+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-3-RRT</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-3-RRT/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Americas Team Lost against Mama Daughter Duo 144.61-157.16<br/> Current Standing: #10<br/> Playoff Chances: 20.1%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 88.5%<br/> Best Performer: David Montgomery (28.90 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="trey-mcbride-te">Trey McBride (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> McBride led all Cardinals in targets and receptions while hauling in Kyler Murray’s only touchdown pass in Sunday’s narrow loss. The 25-year-old McBride didn’t waste much time cracking the end zone this season after needing 15 starts to catch his first touchdown in 2024. McBride is proving to be a consistent fantasy producer at the tight end position, carrying a 17-182-1 receiving line into a Week 4 matchup against the Seahawks on Thursday Night Football.</p> <h4 id="deandre-hopkins-wr">DeAndre Hopkins (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The veteran’s snap share remains low despite his per-target productivity. Hopkins has caught five of six targets for 112 yards and two touchdowns through three games. He logged 14 snaps Monday, which amounted to just a quarter of the Ravens’ offensive plays while Zay Flowers, Rashod Bateman and Tylan Wallace each played over 50 percent of the snaps. While Hopkins has shown he can still play at a high level so far, the low projected snap and target volume make him a difficult player to feel confident starting in redraft leagues.</p> <h4 id="chuba-hubbard-rb">Chuba Hubbard (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Hubbard continued to see his workload shrink relative to Rico Dowdle, with Hubbard earning 19 touches to Dowdle’s 11. That’s still plenty of volume to be productive, but the split cost Hubbard a potential touchdown when Dowdle handled an entire drive early in the fourth quarter that concluded with him finding the end zone. The positive news for Hubbard is that he was still efficient with his touches by consistently picking up chunk gains, and he remains entrenched as the lead back in Carolina.</p> <h4 id="jamarr-chase-wr">Ja’Marr Chase (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Chase was part of the collateral damage of a miserable day for the Bengals on both sides of the ball. The aggressive Vikings defense capitalized on Jake Browning’s presence under center to collect two interceptions, three sacks and three fumble recoveries, but Chase still managed to tie for the team lead in receptions and also set the pace in receiving yards and targets. The star wideout’s production will naturally be hard to trust on a week-to-week basis for as long as Joe Burrow (IR, toe) remains out, but Chase will undoubtedly remain heavily involved in an unenviable Week 4 road matchup against the Broncos on Monday night, Sept. 29.</p> <h4 id="david-montgomery-rb">David Montgomery (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Montgomery waltzed into a tough road environment and casually dropped a new personal best of 151 rushing yards in a single game. The seven-year pro’s longest run of 72 yards surprisingly did not result in either of his two trips to the end zone Monday. Jahmyr Gibbs (22-67-2) finished with 10 more carries and 14 more touches than Montgomery, which was the largest disparity through three weeks for Detroit’s talented backfield tandem. Expect the Lions to feed the Browns a heavy dose of both Montgomery and Gibbs when the two teams meet Week 4.</p> <h4 id="dalton-schultz-te">Dalton Schultz (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Schultz had season highs in both targets and receiving yards, as the Texans made a concerted effort to get the passing game going. C.J. Stroud’s 40 dropbacks (38 attempts, two sacks) were the most in three games, but he threw for only 204 yards (5.4 YPA). The passing volume meant opportunities for Schultz existed even with the season debut of No. 2 wideout Christian Kirk (eight targets). At 0-3 and getting very little offense through the air, the Texans might consider a heavier run-based attack, which would impact all receivers.</p> <h4 id="josh-downs-wr">Josh Downs (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Colts had a relatively flat target distribution, but Downs still slipped behind each of Michael Pittman, Alec Pierce and Tyler Warren for opportunities in the passing game. Downs managed an impressive 29-yard catch early in the first quarter to set up a field goal, but he now has only two catches in two of three games to begin the campaign.</p> <h4 id="travis-etienne-jr-rb">Travis Etienne Jr. (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Etienne found running room at a premium against a talented Texans front, but he was able to rescue fantasy managers from a washout by recording a 10-yard touchdown run with just under two minutes remaining. The score, Etienne’s first on the ground in 2025, delivered what would prove to be the game-winning points. Etienne has seen his rushing yardage total drop in each of the last two contests after opening the season with a 143-yard effort against the Panthers, a trend he’ll aim to reverse in a Week 4 road interconference clash against the 49ers.</p> <h4 id="matthew-stafford-qb">Matthew Stafford (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Stafford and the Rams’ offense left a lot on the table despite scoring 26 points. He threw an interception on the opening possession, then had a pair of drives stall inside the red zone in the first half. The end result was that Stafford averaged only 5.9 yards per attempt, though he also had some positives in the performance. Most notably, he connected with Davante Adams on a deep 44-yard score late in the first quarter, and he also found Kyren Williams for a 10-yard score on the opening drive of the third quarter. Stafford has multiple touchdowns in each of his last two games, and he should have the chance to bounce back from an efficiency perspective in Week 4 against the Colts.</p> <h4 id="rhamondre-stevenson-rb">Rhamondre Stevenson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> After a very impressive Week 2 performance, Stevenson was largely to blame for New England’s Week 3 loss, losing the ball on the first possession to set up Pittsburgh’s first TD of the day, and then fumbling again on the Steelers’ one-yard line in the third quarter. The Patriots’ running game struggled as a whole Sunday, with QB Drake Maye leading the team in rushing yards and Antonio Gibson also losing a fumble. Stevenson’s struggles holding onto the ball could open the door for rookie TreVeyon Henderson to see a much bigger role in Week 4 against the Panthers.</p> <h4 id="spencer-rattler-qb">Spencer Rattler (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Rattler failed to recreate the three-touchdown performance we saw from him in Week 2, resulting in numbers closer to his pedestrian game against Atlanta to open the season. The Saints were outmatched from the jump, falling behind by 32 points at halftime. Things got so bad that rookie backup Tyler Shough saw the field in garbage time. It wouldn’t be surprising to see the quarterbacks flip roles at some point this season for the 0-3 Saints. For now, Rattler figures to continue starting for New Orleans when the team travels to Buffalo next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="aj-brown-wr">A.J. Brown (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Eagles had taken to the air sparingly in the first two weeks of this season, and Brown entered the game with 35 total yards from scrimmage. However, Philadelphia fell behind early against the Rams, and Jalen Hurts had to attempt 32 passes in a comeback effort, allowing Brown to get more opportunity. He turned that into several highlight-worthy plays, including a 38-yard catch deep down the right sideline early in the third quarter and a nine-yard touchdown catch one possession later. It’s no surprise that Brown was productive when given the chance, and the Eagles could be pushed once again in a Week 4 matchup against the Bucs.</p> <h4 id="brian-robinson-jr-rb">Brian Robinson Jr. (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Robinson saw his usage drop to nine percent on offense (six snaps) against the Cardinals, and his two touches checked in well below the 8.5 he averaged over the first two weeks of the campaign. The 26-year-old made the most of his sparse opportunities Sunday, ripping off a season best 19-yard run in the fourth quarter. No other backup saw the field on offense in the win, so Robinson’s reduced playing time was likely the result of the 49ers leaning on Christian McCaffrey heavily against a division opponent. Expect Robinson to continue receiving a handful of carries backing up CMC against the Jaguars next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="cooper-kupp-wr">Cooper Kupp (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Kupp reverted to his low-usage role after commanding nine targets in a Week 2 win over Las Vegas. The veteran wideout finished third in targets, receptions and yardage for the Seahawks behind Jaxon Smith-Njigba (5-96-1) and Tory Horton (3-32-1). Perhaps Kupp can get more involved in Week 4 against a familiar NFC West opponent in the Cardinals on Thursday Night Football.</p> <h4 id="sam-darnold-qb">Sam Darnold (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Darnold had an easy day at the office Sunday, generating most of his statistical production in a lopsided first half of action. Things got so out of hand in the second half that Seattle was able to get both of its backup quarterbacks on the field during garbage time. This was Darnold’s finest performance as a member of the Seahawks, and he is now averaging 221.0 passing yards to go along with four touchdowns and two interceptions through three starts in 2025. Darnold is looking like a mid-level fantasy option heading into a Week 4 matchup against the Cardinals on Thursday Night Football.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_3_2025_RRT_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_3_2025_RRT_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week3"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry></feed>
