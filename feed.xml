</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="kyler-murray-qb">Kyler Murray (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Murray said that his knee injury lingered at times during the 2024 season, but that with another healthy offseason under his belt, he doesn‚Äôt anticipate being hampered at all moving forward. ‚ÄúI do feel like I have to run more next year,‚Äù Murray said, comparing his dual-threat capabilities at full health to those of Lamar Jackson and Josh Allen. The 27-year-old had a career-low 4.6 rushing attempts per game in 2024, though he was efficient on the ground, scoring five times and averaging a career-best 7.1 YPC. If Murray is indeed comfortable rushing more next season, and potentially able to develop improved chemistry with 2024 first-round pick Marvin Harrison, Arizona‚Äôs offense will be primed to take a step forward.</p> <h4 id="kirk-cousins-qb">Kirk Cousins (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Cousins‚Äô attendance at voluntary OTAs is something of a surprise, after he was benched in Week 16 last season in favor of Michael Penix. Atlanta could have released Cousins in mid-March to avoid having his $10 million guaranteed roster bonus kick in, but the team opted to keep the veteran quarterback in house as a backup option or trade asset. However, Cousins‚Äô contract includes a no trade-clause, which he seems unlikely to waive unless it‚Äôs to find a starting role elsewhere.</p> <h4 id="zay-flowers-wr">Zay Flowers (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong></p> <h4 id="christian-watson-wr">Christian Watson (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> LaFleur said Watson‚Äôs work ethic approaching his ACL rehab has been impressive, per Ryan Wood of USA Today, but the timing of the young wideout‚Äôs injury sheds serious doubt on his availability for the early portion of the regular season. Green Bay also invested significant draft capital at the wide receiver position in April‚Äôs draft in the form of first-round pick Matthew Golden and third-rounder Savion Williams. With all of Jayden Reed (shoulder), Romeo Doubs (concussion), Dontayvion Wicks, Bo Melton, Mecole Hardman (knee) and Malik Heath also on hand, the Packers boast one of the league‚Äôs most crowded receiver rooms, meaning Watson will face tough competition for snaps even if he enjoys an exceptional recovery timeline.</p> <h4 id="alexander-mattison-rb">Alexander Mattison (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Mattison is swapping teams with Raheem Mostert, whose deal with the Raiders was reported about two hours earlier. While Mostert perhaps has a chance to rebound from a disappointing 2024 and earn a key role, Mattison will merely be competing for a backup job behind De‚ÄôVon Achane. The Dolphins presumably hope 2024 fourth-round pick Jaylen Wright secures the second spot on the depth chart, with Mattison essentially being a backup plan for the backup. It‚Äôs a tough situation for earning playing time, albeit with the outside chance of a handsome payoff if injuries eventually thrust him into a starting role in Mike McDaniel‚Äôs offense.</p> <h4 id="garrett-wilson-wr">Garrett Wilson (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> General manager Darren Mougey said prior to the 2025 NFL Draft that New York would pick up the fifth-year options of London, Sauce Gardner and Jermaine Johnson (Achilles), and the team has now made each of those transactions official. Wilson is coming off three consecutive 1,000-yard seasons and remains the clear top receiving option on the Jets‚Äô depth chart, with Allen Lazard, Josh Reynolds and Tyler Johnson behind him in the wide receiver room, and with rookie second-round pick Mason Taylor a new addition to the tight end corps. Even if Justin Fields‚Äô dual-threat capabilities result in an overall decline in passing for the Jets‚Äô offense, Wilson figures to retain a tremendous target share following the offseason departures of WR Davante Adams and TE Tyler Conklin, and considering his current lack of competition for volume. Picking up the No. 1 wideout‚Äôs fifth-year option shouldn‚Äôt make the Jets any less motivated to negotiate a long-term extension with Wilson, who will turn 25 in July.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_17_2024_ARV_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_17_2024_ARV_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2024-25,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week17"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Hamlin My Business Week 17 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-17-HMB/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hamlin My Business Week 17 Report"/><published>2025-05-06T01:33:38+00:00</published><updated>2025-05-06T01:33:38+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-17-HMB</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-17-HMB/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Hamlin My Business Won against Tom and Jerry 337.36-295.58<br/> Current Standing: #3<br/> Playoff Chances: 100.0%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 88.3%<br/> Best Performer: Joe Burrow (36.98 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="jameson-williams-wr">Jameson Williams (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> As expected, Williams is now under contract through 2026, with a projected $15.49 million salary for the fifth and final season of his rookie deal. The Lions may be hesitant to discuss an extension after Williams‚Äô breakout third season in 2024, considering his first two NFL campaigns largely were defined by injuries and suspensions. He cleared 1,000 receiving yards on just 91 targets in 15 regular-season games last year, adding 11 carries for 61 yards and a TD, plus two touches for 80 yards and a score in one playoff game. Williams is safe in his starting job but may find it difficult to significantly improve on last year‚Äôs 6.1 targets per game while sharing the field with WR Amon-Ra St. Brown, TE Sam LaPorta and RBs Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery ‚Äì all of whom will be adjusting to new offensive coordinator John Morton, after Ben Johnson left for Chicago‚Äôs HC job.</p> <h4 id="najee-harris-rb">Najee Harris (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> At 6-foot, 221 pounds, Hampton is smaller than Harris but larger than most NFL lead backs, and with 4.46 combine speed to boot. It may not be long before he challenges Harris for the starting job, although the veteran almost certainly would retain a role in that scenario, if only for pass blocking and to help keep Hampton fresh. Harris signed a one-year, $5.25 million contract in March, with all of that money guaranteed and another $4 million available via incentives. Compared to other RBs, that can either be viewed as low-end-starter money or the top of the market for backups.</p> <h4 id="matthew-stafford-qb">Matthew Stafford (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Stafford finally put pen to paper Monday after the two sides agreed to continue their relationship back in February. Stafford will collect $44 million in 2025, and if he‚Äôs on the roster at the start of the 2026 league year, he‚Äôll earn another $40 million for that season. Stafford recently turned 37 years old this offseason, but coach Sean McVay has already stated he believes the quarterback has multiple good seasons left in the tank. Stafford completed 65.8 percent of his passes last season, throwing for 3,762 yards and a 20:8 TD:INT across 16 regular-season starts.</p> <h4 id="tyreek-hill-wr">Tyreek Hill (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Grier noted that Hill, who is recovering from wrist surgery, has been present at team facilities during the early portion of the offseason and is working with new wide receivers coach Robert Prince, per David Furones of the South Florida Sun Sentinel. He dismissed the idea that team was actively looking to trade the veteran wideout by saying the organization would ‚Äúconsider it‚Äù for the unrealistic return of ‚Äútwo first-rounders,‚Äù Barry Jackson of the Miami Herald reports. Things appeared fractured enough between Hill and Miami by the end of the 2024 season that a parting of ways seemed inevitable, but the 31-year-old has since made public efforts to mend fences. After surpassing 1,700 receiving yards in each of the prior two campaigns, Hill was limited to an 81-959-6 line across 17 regular-season appearances last year, enduring both a nagging wrist injury and quarterback difficulties.</p> <h4 id="aaron-jones-rb">Aaron Jones (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> O‚ÄôConnell specifically mentioned goal-line and short-yardage situations as areas where Mason can help, noting that the Vikings ‚Äúleft a lot to be desired‚Äù in those situations last year. Jones returns as the starter after signing a two-year, $20 million contract, but it sounds like he‚Äôs a long shot to match last season‚Äôs career highs for snaps (700), rush attempts (255) and touches (306). The only disappointment in 2024 was scoring three times on 24 carries inside the 10-yard line, with just seven total TDs (five rushing) despite playing all 17 games and recording 1,546 yards from scrimmage (his most since 2019) at rates of 4.5 yards per carry and 8.0 per catch. While ceding goal-line carries is never a good thing for fantasy value, Mason‚Äôs physical presence could help the 30-year-old Jones stay healthy and maintain his strong per-touch yardage production.</p> <h4 id="george-kittle-te">George Kittle (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The deal reportedly includes $40 million guaranteed and likely will lower Kittle‚Äôs 2025 salary-cap hit, which was previously scheduled to come in at $22.09 million. He‚Äôll turn 32 years old in October but hasn‚Äôt shown any signs of slowing down, coming off a 2024 campaign with a five-year high for receptions (78), six-year high for receiving yards (1,106) and the second most touchdowns of his career (eight). Kittle still hasn‚Äôt reached triple-digit targets since 2019, but he‚Äôs capable of handling more volume if injuries to teammates necessitate it. He‚Äôs typically the third tight end taken in early 2025 fantasy drafts, after Brock Bowers and Trey McBride.</p> <h4 id="brock-purdy-qb">Brock Purdy (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Purdy‚Äôs rookie deal is currently set to expire after the 2025 campaign, but he and the 49ers remain engaged in talks surrounding a new extension. Both Michael Silver and Dianna Russini of The Athletic report that Purdy‚Äôs attendance for the start of voluntary OTAs is a sign that contract discussions are moving in the right direction, but this remains a situation that could drag on until the later stage of the offseason. Purdy struggled in 2024 compared to his stellar 2023 season, though the context of Brandon Aiyuk (knee) and Christian McCaffrey (knee) both missing most of the year must be noted. The 25-year-old signal-caller will have do make do without Deebo Samuel, who has been traded to the Commanders, within his offensive playmaking group in 2025, but standout 36-year-old left tackle Trent Williams (ankle) has confirmed his intent to return for a 16th NFL season.</p> <h4 id="chris-godwin-wr">Chris Godwin (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Godwin will stay with the only NFL team he‚Äôs ever known, reportedly getting a $66 million contract that has two-thirds of the money guaranteed at signing. He would‚Äôve signed an even larger deal if his fantastic 2024 campaign hadn‚Äôt been cut short by a dislocated left ankle Week 7. It‚Äôs a good sign that the team with the most information about his recovery was willing to give Godwin a large contract, but we still haven‚Äôt seen any reports about a recovery timeline or the possibility of ligament damage in his injured ankle. Godwin turned 29 in February, after averaging a career-high 19.7 PPR points in his seven games last season. He‚Äôs unlikely to approach that level of production in 2025, coming back from a major injury to rejoin a Tampa Bay offense that now has WR Jalen McMillan competing for targets and Josh Grizzard replacing Liam Coen as the play caller.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_17_2024_HMB_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_17_2024_HMB_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2024-25,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week17"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Mama Daughter Duo Week 17 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-17-JST/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mama Daughter Duo Week 17 Report"/><published>2025-05-06T01:33:38+00:00</published><updated>2025-05-06T01:33:38+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-17-JST</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-17-JST/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Mama Daughter Duo Lost against To Infinity and Bijan! 215.62-257.30<br/> Current Standing: #6<br/> Playoff Chances: 0.0%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 82.5%<br/> Best Performer: Bo Nix (21.86 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

Dowdle settled for a one-year deal with a reported base value of $3 million, which suggests NFL teams view him as a backup-caliber player even after he ran for 1,079 yards in Dallas last year. Hubbard is the better pure runner, and generally a superior player, but it is possible he cedes more of the backfield work in 2025 (compared to last season) if Carolina‚Äôs coaches like Dowdle more than they liked Sanders. There‚Äôs no indication Hubbard‚Äôs calf and knee injuries from the end of 2024 will be a problem for the upcoming season, whereas 2024 second-round pick Jonathon Brooks figures to miss significant time after tearing his right ACL for the second time in two years.</p> <h4 id="david-njoku-te">David Njoku (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Fannin is a unique prospect, lacking ideal size (6-foot-3, 241 pounds) and speed (4.71 40) but still attracting plenty of NFL interest thanks to his FBS-leading 117 receptions at Bowling Green last season. Njoku is bigger, faster, stronger and a better blocker, but Fannin may ultimately push for some passing-down snaps in single-TE formations if he runs crisp routes and is quick to learn the offense. It‚Äôs a comparable situation to the one in Baltimore with Isaiah Likely, who also put up huge numbers at a mediocre college program and notably didn‚Äôt have much impact on Mark Andrews‚Äô role until their third season playing together. Of course, Njoku isn‚Äôt held in the same regard as Andrews, and the Browns may take more of an interest in developing young players during a likely rebuilding year than the Ravens did while trying to win a Super Bowl. Meanwhile, there hasn‚Äôt been any update on the knee injury that held Njoku out for the final two games of last season. That‚Äôs not necessarily a bad thing, as it might just mean he avoided surgery and completed his recovery without incident.</p> <h4 id="anthony-richardson-qb">Anthony Richardson (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Taken fourth overall in the 2023 draft, Richardson has missed 17 of a possible 34 games because of injuries and was benched for another two for performance reasons, with lowlights of his career to date including a 47.7 percent completion rate in 2024. It at least sounds like he‚Äôll be healthy for the start of the offseason program, after missing the final two weeks of last season with a back injury. Jones has his own shortcomings and is highly unlikely to ever be anything more than a low-end starter or solid backup, but superior accuracy on short passes is one clear edge he has over Richardson, along with a better track record of availability (although that hasn‚Äôt exactly been a strength for Jones, either).</p> <h4 id="jordan-mason-rb">Jordan Mason (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> O‚ÄôConnell also discussed returning starter Aaron Jones, saying ‚Äúwhen [Jones] has‚Ä¶ that 1A/1B backfield structure, he can be a total game-changer every time he touches the ball.‚Äù In other words, O‚ÄôConnell hopes the 223-pound Mason can be 1B, taking carries between the tackles while Jones gets most of the work in space. The Vikings traded for Mason in mid-March, shortly after San Francisco gave him a second-round restricted free agent tender (and after Minnesota re-signed Jones on a two-year, $20 million contract). Mason missed the final five weeks of his 2024 breakout season with a high-ankle injury, but there hasn‚Äôt been any report of surgery or a prolonged rehab process this offseason.</p> <h4 id="derek-carr-qb">Derek Carr (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Loomis outwardly declined to answer any questions about Carr‚Äôs injury or status with the team at Wednesday‚Äôs press conference, additionally refusing to answer affirmatively or negatively when asked whether New Orleans‚Äô starting quarterback is currently on the roster, per John Sigler of USA Today. Carr reportedly is considering shoulder surgery that could impact his availability for 2025 due to a previously undisclosed injury, with speculation that the decision is related to dissatisfaction with the Saints and a desire to move on. Due to the veteran quarterback‚Äôs contract being restructured in March, he is owed roughly $40 million guaranteed in salary and bonuses this season.</p> <h4 id="brandin-cooks-wr">Brandin Cooks (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Per Adam Schefter of ESPN, the wideout‚Äôs reported deal is a two-year pact worth $13 million. Cooks, who joined the NFL as a 2014 first-round pick of the Saints, is thus poised to return to New Orleans, where he‚Äôll add speed and experience to a WR corps which is led by Chris Olave and also includes Rashid Shaheed. In 10 regular-season games with the Cowboys in 2024, Cooks recorded 26 catches for 259 yards and three touchdowns on 54 targets, but with his looming change of scenery, a bounce-back campaign could be in order for the 31-year-old, with a path to steady snaps seemingly on tap for him in 2025.</p> <h4 id="christian-mccaffrey-rb">Christian McCaffrey (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Coach Kyle Shanahan declared McCaffrey healthy in early April, which wasn‚Äôt surprising after the running back told reporters in early January that he was already almost back to full strength. The 49ers then traded Jordan Mason to the Vikings and allowed Elijah Mitchell to sign with the Chiefs, leaving 2024 fourth-round pick Isaac Guerendo as McCaffrey‚Äôs likely backup for 2025. McCaffrey missed the first eight games of last season with Achilles tendinitis in both legs, later missing the final five games because of a PCL sprain in his right knee. It was his third time in the past five years missing double-digit games, but he played either 16 or 17 regular-season games in 2017, 2018, 2019, 2022 and 2023. McCaffrey is under contract through 2027 after signing an extension last summer, albeit with no guaranteed money beyond 2025.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_17_2024_JST_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_17_2024_JST_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2024-25,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week17"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Fantasy Guru Kayden Week 17 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-17-KTT/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Fantasy Guru Kayden Week 17 Report"/><published>2025-05-06T01:33:38+00:00</published><updated>2025-05-06T01:33:38+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-17-KTT</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-17-KTT/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Fantasy Guru Kayden Lost against Hit and Ruggs 213.94-222.72<br/> Current Standing: #8<br/> Playoff Chances: 0.0%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 86.3%<br/> Best Performer: Jonathan Taylor (26.60 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="drake-london-wr">Drake London (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The eighth overall pick from the 2022 Draft is now under contract through 2026, although it may not be long before he signs an extension that locks him in beyond that. London had career highs in every major counting stat last year, including 41 more targets (158) and 366 more yards (1,271) than his previous personal bests. He had just three 100-yard performances, but two of those came in the final two games after Michael Penix took over as Atlanta‚Äôs starting QB. There should be plenty of volume for London again in 2025, after the Falcons focused on their defense this offseason and failed to acquire any significant competition for targets or carries.</p> <h4 id="deandre-hopkins-wr">DeAndre Hopkins (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Hopkins split the 2024 campaign between the Titans and Kansas City, posting a 56-610-5 line on 80 targets in 16 regular-season games. Overall, it marked his fewest catches and receiving yards since 2021, when he was limited to 10 appearances with the Cardinals. Hopkins will turn 33 in June, and with Zay Flowers (knee) and Rashod Bateman (undisclosed) currently serving as Baltimore‚Äôs top receivers and TEs Mark Andrews and Isaiah Likely also on the roster, Hopkins may not be better than the fifth option in the passing game for Lamar Jackson.</p> <h4 id="kareem-hunt-rb">Kareem Hunt (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Hunt joined Kansas City last September in the wake of an early-season IR stint for Isiah Pacheco due to a fractured fibula. He served as the team‚Äôs starter for a stretch and then split backfield reps with Pacheco once the latter returned to the lineup, up through the Chiefs‚Äô loss to Philadelphia in Super Bowl LIX. Hunt concluded the regular season with 200 carries for 728 yards and seven scores across 13 appearances, plus 23 catches for 176 yards through the air (32 targets). A full offseason to get back to 100 percent form may allow Pacheco to reclaim a firm grasp on the lead role of the Chiefs‚Äô backfield, which also added speedster Elijah Mitchell in free agency, but Hunt‚Äôs solid showing in 2024 figures to leave him in position for a solid amount of complementary snaps. The exact pecking order of Kansas City‚Äôs rushing attack may not gain clarity until training camp and/or the preseason.</p> <h4 id="zamir-white-rb">Zamir White (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Jeanty‚Äôs expected to take on a workhorse role out of the gate, and free-agent signing Raheem Mostert is better suited to playing in pass-catching situations than White, who has just 21 catches through three NFL seasons. White has presumably recovered from the quadriceps injury that sidelined him after Week 11 in 2024, but he‚Äôs unlikely to meaningfully challenge Jeanty for early-down work considering White averaged just 2.8 yards per carry in 2024. Sincere McCormick (ankle), Dylan Laube and Chris Collier also will compete for roles in Vegas‚Äô backfield.</p> <h4 id="george-pickens-wr">George Pickens (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Pickens is entering the final year of his rookie deal with Pittsburgh, and the team spent a second-round pick to acquire fellow big-play-specialist DK Metcalf earlier this offseason. The Steelers then signed Metcalf to a five-year, $150 million contract, a move that has resulted in questions about Pickens‚Äô long-term future with the team. While Pittsburgh reportedly isn‚Äôt directly shopping the 24-year-old, he figures to have a strong market for teams in need of a No. 1 or talented No. 2 option at wideout, especially if there remains belief around the league that his production upside remains untapped. Quarterback play has doubtless limited Pickens across his first three seasons in the league, and the Steelers‚Äô starter under center for 2025 still remains undetermined.</p> <h4 id="sterling-shepard-wr">Sterling Shepard (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Known for a promising career that was derailed by a series of severe injuries, Shepard left the Giants for the first time last year and ended up spending much of 2024 as Tampa Bay‚Äôs No. 3 or 4 receiver. He‚Äôll likely enter camp somewhere between fourth and sixth on the depth chart, unless Chris Godwin‚Äôs recovery from an ankle dislocation comes along slower than expected. Godwin, Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan are locked in as the team‚Äôs top three wide receivers, leaving the likes of Shepard, Trey Palmer and Rakim Jarrett to compete for depth roles.</p> <h4 id="will-levis-qb">Will Levis (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The pick was expected for some time beforehand, and the Titans likely would‚Äôve already moved Levis if they got an offer for something like a mid-round pick. The question now is whether they‚Äôll trade him for less than that, creating a fresh start for both parties after back-to-back disastrous seasons for the Tennessee offense since Levis was taken 33rd overall in the 2023 NFL Draft. Levis turns 26 in June and hasn‚Äôt shown much on the field that hints at developing into a legitimate NFL starter, but he does have a strong arm, decent mobility and a prototypical build (6-foot-4, 229 pounds).</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_17_2024_KTT_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_17_2024_KTT_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2024-25,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week17"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Michael‚Äôs Managable Team Week 17 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-17-MMT/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Michael‚Äôs Managable Team Week 17 Report"/><published>2025-05-06T01:33:38+00:00</published><updated>2025-05-06T01:33:38+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-17-MMT</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-17-MMT/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Michael‚Äôs Managable Team Won against Abbey Road to Victory 240.22-207.02<br/> Current Standing: #9<br/> Playoff Chances: 0.0%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 87.7%<br/> Best Performer: Justin Herbert (24.44 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

Nonetheless, coming off a 2024 campaign in which he scored 18 touchdowns (16 rushing) despite playing just 48 percent of offensive snaps in his 16 regular-season appearances, Cook has been open about his desire for both a substantial extension and increased playing time. Still, Buffalo has Ray Davis entering Year 2, and the team opted to re-sign pending free agent Ty Johnson, indicating some level of commitment to a backfield rotation. How much attention the team pays to the running back position in the 2025 NFL Draft, which kicks off Thursday, could be telling as to Cook‚Äôs odds of attaining a new deal. He‚Äôs currently heading into the final year of his rookie contract after having compiled back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons.</p> <h4 id="dak-prescott-qb">Dak Prescott (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Prescott‚Äôs season came to an end after just eight games last season due to the hamstring injury, and he underwent surgery in mid-November. The veteran quarterback has been rehabbing since, and his comments Friday suggest that everything has gone smoothly in his recovery. Cowboys executive vice president Stephen Jones said in late March that Prescott will be limited during the initial portion of the Cowboys‚Äô offseason program, but Jones also mentioned that Prescott‚Äôs rehab was going well. It appears both the organization and the player are eyeing a cautious approach to organized team activities, which begin in May, as Prescott indicated Friday that he‚Äôll take part in some capacity but added, ‚ÄúThen again I just understand my age, what I‚Äôve had, what I‚Äôve went through, it‚Äôs about being my best in the fall. So I‚Äôm not rushing anything, but I‚Äôm where I want to be.‚Äù</p> <h4 id="rhamondre-stevenson-rb">Rhamondre Stevenson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Per Graff, in the wake of the draft, Stevenson, Henderson and Antonio Gibson are poised to lead the team‚Äôs RB corps this coming season, with Terrell Jennings and reported UDFA signing Lan Larison in the depth mix. Stevenson is coming off a 2024 season in which he recorded 207 carries for 801 yards and seven TDs to go along with 33 catches (on 41 targets) for 168 yards and another score in 15 games. Ball security was an issue for Stevenson in that span, however, with the 2021 fourth-rounder racking up seven fumbles after recording just one (in 12 contests) in 2023. That‚Äôs an issue Stevenson will no doubt focus on improving, but in any case, the addition of the dynamic Henderson seems destined to cut into his workload this season. A committee approach featuring the bruising Stevenson and the speedy Henderson, with Gibson also sprinkled in, appears the most likely outcome, a looming scenario that is on track to impact Stevenson‚Äôs volume in 2025.</p> <h4 id="jaylen-warren-rb">Jaylen Warren (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The 224-pound rookie, drafted 83rd overall, profiles cleanly as a replacement for Harris, but that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean it‚Äôll be a one-for-one thing with Johnson immediately taking 250-plus carries. Harris topped that number in each of his four seasons in Pittsburgh, despite averaging 4.1 YPC or less every year, in part because he never missed a game and was decent enough at blocking and receiving to stay on the field for some passing downs. Johnson may well prove to be Harris‚Äô equal or superior as a runner, but Warren could nonetheless take on a larger role than he had the past few seasons if the Steelers aren‚Äôt confident in other aspects of Johnson‚Äôs game. Warren signed a second-round restricted free agent tender a few days before the draft, keeping him under contract for 2025 at $5.35 million ‚Äì about the same as what Harris is getting from the Chargers, coincidentally.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_17_2024_MMT_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_17_2024_MMT_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2024-25,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week17"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Pink Pony Club Week 17 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-17-PONY/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Pink Pony Club Week 17 Report"/><published>2025-05-06T01:33:38+00:00</published><updated>2025-05-06T01:33:38+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-17-PONY</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-17-PONY/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Pink Pony Club Won against Who Killed Charbonnet Ramsey? 303.56-297.94<br/> Current Standing: #1<br/> Playoff Chances: 100.0%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 86.2%<br/> Best Performer: Jayden Daniels (31.78 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="rashod-bateman-wr">Rashod Bateman (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong></p> <h4 id="adam-thielen-wr">Adam Thielen (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Thielen said in early February that he wants to play for at least one more season, and he‚Äôll be able to do that as he returns for a third campaign in Carolina on a revised contract. The veteran wideout‚Äôs 48 catches and 615 yards last season were his fewest since 2019, but he played in only 10 games due to a hamstring injury and still managed to catch five touchdowns. Despite the missed time, Thielen led Carolina in both receiving yards and receiving touchdowns last season, and he‚Äôll likely continue to be a top target for up-and-coming quarterback Bryce Young in 2025.</p> <h4 id="brian-thomas-jr-wr">Brian Thomas Jr. (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> That much is clear; the real question is who else will catch passes from Trevor Lawrence on a regular basis. WR Christian Kirk (collarbone) and TE Evan Engram (shoulder) both are entering contract years without any guaranteed money remaining on their contracts, and WR Gabe Davis (knee) is coming off a disappointing season that ended early due to a meniscus tear. Thomas may be at the level already where competition doesn‚Äôt really matter and teammates are competing with each other for targets rather than him. He closed 2024 with one of the most productive stretches ever seen from a rookie wide receiver while catching passes from backup QB Mac Jones, posting six straight games with at least 10 targets and 76 yards while averaging 7.5 receptions for 99.8 yards and 0.83 TDs. Similar output over the course of a full season is unlikely even for a player with Thomas‚Äô rare combination of size, speed and agility, but it isn‚Äôt entirely out of the question under Coen, whose lone year as Tampa Bay‚Äôs offensive coordinator coincided with the top PPR scoring average of Chris Godwin‚Äôs career (19.7 per game) as well as Mike Evans‚Äô best average (17.2) since 2019.</p> <h4 id="kyren-williams-rb">Kyren Williams (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Williams has been a polarizing player in the fantasy sphere since his 2023 breakout, and that‚Äôs unlikely to change after he dipped to 4.1 YPC in 2024 while fumbling six times (including once in the playoffs). He otherwise had another big year, ranking third in carries per game (19.8), sixth in rushing yards per game (81.2) and tied for fifth in rushing touchdowns (14), giving him 26 rushing scores and five receiving TDs in 38 regular-season games over the past two seasons. Blake Corum, a 2024 third-round pick, never made a serious push to threaten Williams last season, and it sounds like the Rams would rather give Williams a contract extension than search for his replacement. Snead said he‚Äôs already exchanged initial contract terms with agent Drew Rosenhaus.</p> <h4 id="tyrone-tracy-jr-rb">Tyrone Tracy Jr. (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Taken 166th overall a year earlier, Tracy never looked back after Singletary‚Äôs groin injury opened up a starting job Week 5. Tracy started 12 of 13 games from that point forward and averaged 4.4 YPC for the season, despite being stuck in a brutal offense, with the main negatives being five fumbles and five drops. He‚Äôs the favorite to start Week 1, but it may be an open competition this summer, considering Singletary has a respectable track record as an NFL starter and Skattebo exploded for 2,316 yards from scrimmage at Arizona State last year. Speed is the obvious advantage for Tracy, a former college wideout who ran a 4.48 40 at 5-foot-11, 209 pounds. Singletary ran a 4.66 before he was drafted six years ago, and Skattebo was timed around 4.6 or 4.65 at his pro day this spring.</p> <h4 id="terry-mclaurin-wr">Terry McLaurin (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> McLaurin has one season remaining on the three-year, $68.2 million extension he signed in 2022, with $19 million to $20 million in real-money compensation for 2025. That might be enough to prevent a holdout, but the Commanders would rather lock him in for multiple years after McLaurin finished 2024 with career highs for touchdowns (13), catch rate (70.2 percent) and PPR points per game (15.9). Tough as it may be to avoid TD regression, McLaurin figures to remain highly efficient and may even get a slight boost to his target volume, entering his second season in an offense led by QB Jayden Daniels and OC Kliff Kingsbury. Offseason acquisition Deebo Samuel should mostly get touches/targets that went to Olamide Zaccheaus, Dyami Brown and Noah Brown last year, including many of the screens that were a frequent feature of Kingsbury‚Äôs offense. McLaurin remains unchallenged as the team‚Äôs top threat to catch deep and intermediate passes.</p> <h4 id="deebo-samuel-sr-wr">Deebo Samuel Sr. (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Samuel‚Äôs reworked contract seems mutually beneficial, as it provides him with new incentives and a stronger baseline for 2025, while likely lessening Washington‚Äôs commitment beyond the coming season. He previously had a $16.6 million non-guaranteed salary for 2025. Coming off a lackluster 2024 campaign in San Francisco, the 29-year-old playmaker will work to reignite his career while lining up alongside reigning second-team All-Pro selection Terry McLaurin. Samuel‚Äôs versatility will make him a strong fit for offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury‚Äôs scheme, as long as he can regain some of the dynamic abilities he showcased during his prime years in San Francisco. He recorded just 51 catches (on 81 targets) for 670 yards and three scores and added 136 yards and a touchdown on 42 carries over 15 appearances during his final season with the 49ers.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_17_2024_PONY_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_17_2024_PONY_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2024-25,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week17"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Hit and Ruggs Week 17 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-17-RRT/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hit and Ruggs Week 17 Report"/><published>2025-05-06T01:33:38+00:00</published><updated>2025-05-06T01:33:38+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-17-RRT</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-17-RRT/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Hit and Ruggs Won against Fantasy Guru Kayden 222.72-213.94<br/> Current Standing: #7<br/> Playoff Chances: 0.0%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 83.8%<br/> Best Performer: Jared Goff (25.82 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

Per Adam Schefter of ESPN, the 25 year-old‚Äôs $76 million deal includes $43 million guaranteed and an average annual value of $19 million, the highest ever for any NFL tight end. This past season, the 2022 second-rounder caught a career-high 111 passes (on 147 targets) for 1,146 yards and two TDs in 16 regular-season contests, a level of production that makes him an elite fantasy option at his position ahead of the upcoming NFL campaign.</p> <h4 id="diontae-johnson-wr">Diontae Johnson (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> After spending the first five years of his career with the Steelers, the 2019 third-rounder was shipped to the Panthers last offseason, dealt to the Ravens in late October and also had a brief stint with the Texans down the stretch after a tumultuous time in Baltimore. Between the three teams, Johnson hauled in 33 of 67 targets for 375 yards and three touchdowns in 12 regular-season games. All but the TD mark were career lows. Upon joining Cleveland, he‚Äôll be a part of his third AFC North organization and likely will be in the mix for regular snaps in a receiving corps without established options beyond Jerry Jeudy and Cedric Tillman (concussion).</p> <h4 id="geno-smith-qb">Geno Smith (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Upon getting dealt from Seattle to Las Vegas on March 7, Smith still had one year remaining on his existing contract, but the Raiders have made a new commitment to the quarterback, with Jordan Schultz of Fox Sports reporting the deal is worth $85.5 million, with $66.5 million guaranteed. The 34-year-old thus can be expected to be a Raider beyond the 2025 campaign after averaging 249.5 yards per game and compiling a 71:35 TD:INT over 49 starts the previous three seasons.</p> <h4 id="allen-lazard-wr">Allen Lazard (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> It‚Äôs the third season of a four-year contract that now includes $1.75 million guaranteed for 2025, after Lazard barely played in 2023 but rebounded last season to score six touchdowns in 12 games (10 starts). He turned 29 in December and may now end up in an open competition for WR roles behind No. 1 Garrett Wilson. This will be Lazard‚Äôs first season playing for a team that doesn‚Äôt have QB Aaron Rodgers.</p> <h4 id="breece-hall-rb">Breece Hall (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The other two presumably are 2024 fourth-round pick Braelon Allen and 2024 fifth-round pick Isaiah Davis, both of whom had some nice moments as rookies while spelling Hall off the bench during his disappointing season. It won‚Äôt come as any surprise if the uber-talented Hall improves in 2025 and re-establishes himself as a workhorse back under a new coaching staff, but it‚Äôs nonetheless interesting to see the contrast between Glenn‚Äôs comment on Hall and what he said when reporters asked about WR Garrett Wilson. Glenn referred to Wilson as a ‚Äúdynamic player‚Äù and said the Jets will try to get him the ball ‚Äúas much as possible.‚Äù</p> <h4 id="cooper-kupp-wr">Cooper Kupp (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Per Adam Schefter of ESPN, it‚Äôs a three-year deal for Kupp, who spent the first eight seasons of his career with the Rams. Kupp will join a receiving corps that moved on from DK Metcalf (traded to the Steelers) and Tyler Lockett (released) this offseason, meaning he‚Äôll be working with third-year pro Jaxon Smith-Njigba and veteran vertical threat Marquez Valdes-Scantling in an offense led by new QB Sam Darnold. Since his standout 145-1,947-16 performance on 191 targets in 2021, Kupp hasn‚Äôt surpassed 75 catches, 812 yards or six touchdowns in any of the ensuing three campaigns while missing 18 regular-season contests during that span.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_17_2024_RRT_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_17_2024_RRT_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2024-25,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week17"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">To Infinity and Bijan!

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="cole-kmet-te">Cole Kmet (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> In 2024, Kmet recorded 47 receptions for 474 yards and four touchdowns on 55 targets, marking his least productive season since his rookie year in 2020. After playing 87 percent of the offensive snaps last season, Kmet now faces significant competition following the first-round selection of Loveland, whose arrival could sharply reduce his role. Although Loveland is expected to be an adequate blocker, the Bears likely drafted the former Michigan standout for his ability to create mismatches in the passing game. Unless the situation shifts during training camp, Kmet may go undrafted in the majority of fantasy leagues.</p> <h4 id="tee-higgins-wr">Tee Higgins (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Higgins and Cincinnati were able to come to an agreement on a long-term deal after the wide receiver had been franchise tagged for the second straight year. The 26-year-old caught 73 of 109 targets for 911 yards and 10 touchdowns over 12 regular-season games in 2024, and he‚Äôll now remain a Bengal for the foreseeable future. Teammate Ja‚ÄôMarr Chase and the team also agreed on a four-year, $161 million contract extension Sunday, so the formidable wideout duo will continue to cause problems for defenses for years to come.</p> <h4 id="mike-gesicki-te">Mike Gesicki (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Gesicki joined the Bengals on a one-year, $2.5 million contract in March of 2024 after spending the 2023 season with the Patriots and the first five years of his NFL career with the Dolphins. After logging 61 catches in the two seasons prior to 2024, Gesicki had a nice bounce-back campaign in Cincinnati, where he registered 65 catches (on 83 targets) for 665 yards and two touchdowns across 17 regular-season games. Gesicki had six games in which he tallied at least 50 receiving yards, and the 2018 second-round pick out of Penn State will continue to serve as Joe Burrow‚Äôs security blanket in the passing game.</p> <h4 id="michael-pittman-jr-wr">Michael Pittman Jr. (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The wideout expressed confidence that his rehab work has been sufficient to get past his back injury, per James Boyd of The Athletic. Last year, Pittman reported pain in training camp but managed to suit up for 16 regular-season games. The 27-year-old said that he‚Äôs already had the opportunity to work out with new quarterback Daniel Jones, though Pittman‚Äôs schedule hasn‚Äôt yet overlapped with that of Anthony Richardson (back), Boyd reports. Jones and Richardson will have an open competition for the starting role, but whoever wins the starting gig, Pittman, Alec Pierce and Josh Downs will be positioned to headline Indianapolis‚Äô wide receiver corps.</p> <h4 id="trevor-lawrence-qb">Trevor Lawrence (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Lawrence underwent surgery on his left, non-throwing shoulder Dec. 17 and was in a sling until late January. While the Jaguars plan to bring him along slowly, he‚Äôs expected to be fully cleared for the start of training camp later this summer. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre optimistic that we‚Äôll get there in terms of where we need to go,‚Äù coach Liam Coen said Wednesday. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll be on a pitch count for those things. In terms of the where he has to get to, because he has little touch points he needs to reach before he can obviously get out onto the grass and do it full speed, everything‚Äôs moving forward. He feels really good right now, so excited about that.‚Äù Lawrence relayed that he‚Äôs ‚Äúvery optimistic‚Äù he‚Äôll be ready well ahead of Week 1.</p> <h4 id="raheem-mostert-rb">Raheem Mostert (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Raiders never figured to settle for the 33-year-old Mostert as their lead back, unchallenged, but there was at least some chance he‚Äôd compete to be 1A in a committee. He instead figures to be purely a backup, behind one of the best RB prospects in recent memory. The good news for Mostert is weak competition for backup roles, with the Raiders otherwise rostering Zamir White (quadriceps), Sincere McCormick (ankle), Dylan Laube and Chris Collier.</p> <h4 id="quentin-johnston-wr">Quentin Johnston (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Chargers‚Äô top receiver, Ladd McConkey, is at his best working from the slot, yet also figures to get playing time in two-wide formations (as was the case for much of last season). Johnston thus finds himself in a tricky situation, despite being a recent first-round pick (22nd overall in 2023) who improved considerably between Years 1 and 2. The improved version was still wildly inconsistent, memorably putting up 186 yards in Week 18 before going catch-less (on five targets) in a wild-card round loss at Houston. Johnston is good with the ball in his hands, especially relative to other big WRs, but Harris may prove superior at getting open and catching the ball. There‚Äôs also some chance, though perhaps a slim one, that Williams emerges as a real threat again, now two years removed from an ACL tear and returning to Los Angeles after a one-year sabbatical. The good news for those interested in Johnston is that his already-modest ADP figures to drop even further after the Harris pick.</p> <h4 id="russell-wilson-qb">Russell Wilson (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Giants have been in search of a new starting quarterback since moving on from Daniel Jones last season, and Wilson seemingly will be the choice for them to begin 2025, even with fellow offseason signing Jameis Winston on the roster and the draft still to come. Wilson will receive $10.5 million guaranteed upon signing, with the potential to make $21 million this season. In 11 regular-season appearances (all starts) in his only campaign with the Steelers in 2024, he completed 214 of 336 passes (63.7 percent) for 2,482 yards, 16 touchdowns and five interceptions, had 43 carries for 155 yards and two more TDs and fumbled five times (four lost).</p> <h4 id="mike-evans-wr">Mike Evans (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Evans‚Äô restructured deal will allow Tampa Bay greater room to maneuver as the team continues to work through free agency and prepare for the 2025 NFL Draft. Coming off his 11th consecutive 1,000-yard season, and with teammate Chris Godwin (knee - ACL) having re-signed with the Buccaneers, Evans is primed to run things back with quarterback Baker Mayfield in a familiar ‚Äì and ideal ‚Äì situation. Evans will turn 32 less than a month before the 2025 regular season kicks off in what will be a contract year. He‚Äôs yet to show any signs of slowing down and remains positioned as Mayfield‚Äôs go-to receiving option, though former offensive coordinator Liam Cohen‚Äôs departure to take on the Jaguars‚Äô head coaching position is notable. Replacing Cohen via the internal promotion of last year‚Äôs pass-game coordinator, Josh Grizzard, still gives the Buccaneers‚Äô offense some amount of continuity at the coordinator spot.</p> <h4 id="tyler-lockett-wr">Tyler Lockett (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Lockett spent the first 10 seasons of his career in Seattle but was cut ahead of the new league year in a salary cap move. The 32-year-old wideout is coming off of a down 2024 campaign that saw him post a 49-600-2 receiving line as the third option in the Seahawks‚Äô passing game. In Tennessee, Lockett figures to fill the old Tyler Boyd role from last season, sliding in as a veteran slot man on the tail end of his career. Look for the Titans to add more pass-catching help in this week‚Äôs NFL Draft.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_17_2024_TIB_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_17_2024_TIB_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2024-25,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week17"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry></feed>
