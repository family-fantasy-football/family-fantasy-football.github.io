</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="drake-london-wr">Drake London (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The fourth-year wideout didn’t reach 60 receiving yards or find the end zone in the first three weeks of the season, but London broke out in Week 4, highlighting his performance with a five-yard TD reception from Michael Penix in the first quarter. London led the Falcons in targets – no one else got more than five – as well as catches and receiving yards, and he remains the unquestioned top option in the team’s passing game headed into a Week 5 bye, ahead of a tough Week 6 battle against the Bills.</p> <h4 id="justice-hill-rb">Justice Hill (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Though the Ravens were in a catch-up script for much of the game, Hill played his fewest snaps of the season by a wide margin. The veteran had played at least 40% of the snaps in the first four weeks before bottoming out with 30% on Sunday. Opportunities dried up as a result as he had just one carry and two targets on the day. Baltimore’s offense is in a tough spot as long as Lamar Jackson is sidelined and the ripple effects fall across the skill players, including Hill. The Ravens host the Rams in Week 6</p> <h4 id="joshua-palmer-wr">Joshua Palmer (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Palmer was held to a 23-yard catch in the the second quarter for much of the game before hauling in a 13-yard grab on the last play of regulation. He was on the field for 35 of 68 offensive snaps (51.5 percent), which was third most among Bills wide receivers behind Khalil Shakir (43) and Keon Coleman (42). Palmer saw nine targets in his Bills debut Week 1 against the Ravens, but he has seen three looks or less from Josh Allen in each of the four games since. The lack of targets makes Palmer hard to count on from a fantasy perspective heading into Buffalo’s Week 6 road contest against Atlanta on Monday, Oct. 13.</p> <h4 id="courtland-sutton-wr">Courtland Sutton (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Sutton led the Broncos in receptions, receiving yards and targets on the afternoon, recording a team-high 34-yard catch along the way. The veteran wideout fell just short of what would have been his second 100-yard game of the campaign, but he’s now posted at least 81 receiving yards in three straight contests. Sutton figures to remain Bo Nix’s top target when the Broncos travel to London to face the Jets in a Week 6 clash next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="trevor-lawrence-qb">Trevor Lawrence (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Lawrence put the Jaguars on his shoulders for the majority of the night despite a critical early second-quarter fumble at Kansas City’s one-yard line, helping spearhead a comeback from an early 14-0 deficit with a three-yard touchdown pass to Parker Washington and the first of two rushing scores to knot the game back up just before the halfway point of the third quarter. Lawrence then saved his best for the most important part of the contest, leading a seven-play, 60-yard game-winning march that he capped off with an eventful one-yard touchdown run that began with him stumbling twice due to having his foot stepped on by an offensive lineman as he dropped back. Lawrence still is a work in progress in head coach Liam Coen’s offense, but he completed a season-best 72.0 percent of his passes Monday night ahead of a Week 6 home matchup against a Seahawks defense that allowed the Buccaneers’ Baker Mayfield to complete 29 of 33 passes for 379 yards and two TDs in Seattle’s Week 5 loss.</p> <h4 id="hollywood-brown-wr">Hollywood Brown (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Brown tied for second on the Chiefs in targets while checking in third in both receptions and receiving yards. The busy night for the veteran wideout was par for the course thus far this season, as Brown has no fewer than five targets in any of his first five contests. Brown also recorded his first catch of at least 20 yards since Week 1 on Monday night, and he’ll continue to profile as a key target for Patrick Mahomes in a Week 6 Sunday night showdown at home against the Lions.</p> <h4 id="jakobi-meyers-wr">Jakobi Meyers (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> With Brock Bowers (knee) unavailable, the expectation was that Meyers would be even busier than usual in his role as the Raiders’ No. 1 receiver. However, all of Tre Tucker, Ashton Jeanty and even practice squad call-up Albert Okwuegbunam outpaced Meyers in receptions, receiving yards or both. After opening the season in typically productive fashion with a 17-228-0 line on 26 targets over his first three games, Meyers has slumped to an 8-62-0 tally on 13 targets over the last pair of contests. The veteran will have a good opportunity to bounce back in Week 6, however, as a suspect Titans defense comes to Las Vegas next Sunday afternoon.</p> <h4 id="rashid-shaheed-wr">Rashid Shaheed (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Most of that production came on a single play – an 87-yard catch-and-run in the second quarter that Shaheed took to the house. The fourth-year wideout hadn’t exceeded 52 receiving yards in a game this year prior to Sunday, and second-year QB Spencer Rattler may not be able to find his deep threat so easily against more competent secondaries, but it was still an encouraging sign for Shaheed and the Saints’ aerial attack. He’ll look for another big play or two in Week 6 against the Patriots.</p> <h4 id="saquon-barkley-rb">Saquon Barkley (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Barkley was notably listed as a non-participant on Monday’s practice estimate, but Rapoport’s report suggests that the star back isn’t in danger of being sidelined Thursday. That said, Barkley’s status still is worth monitoring ahead of Week 6 action, with added context on that front slated to arrive via Tuesday’s practice report.</p> <h4 id="brock-purdy-qb">Brock Purdy (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable</p> <h4 id="george-kittle-te">George Kittle (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Injured Reserve <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> After missing the requisite four games upon being placed on IR following Week 1 action, Kittle will be eligible for activation during the upcoming week, but he seemingly hasn’t made enough progress in his recovery from a hamstring injury to put himself in consideration for a return just yet. The 49ers could still elect to open Kittle’s 21-day practice window next week, though Shanahan hinted that the team may prefer to wait until Week 7 before having the 31-year-old get back on the field, per Matt Barrows of The Athletic. While Kittle has been out for the past four weeks, the 49ers have had Jake Tonges and Luke Farrell share snaps at tight end, with the former player proving to be the more formidable pass-catching threat.</p> <h4 id="tony-pollard-rb">Tony Pollard (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> It was an eventful day for Pollard with significant swings in performance. He picked up 26 yards on four carries on the Titans’ opening drive, but his next notable contribution to the game was losing a fumble that set up an Arizona touchdown. Pollard then redeemed himself with a one-yard score of his own early in the fourth quarter to kickstart a frantic Tennessee comeback that resulted in the team’s first win of the season. Also notable was that Pollard out-touched Tyjae Spears 17-4, though Spears is likely to become more involved in future matchups. Pollard has done an admirable job early in the campaign given the state of Tennessee’s offense, picking up at least 60 yards on the ground in four of five games.</p> <h4 id="zach-ertz-te">Zach Ertz (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Despite Jayden Daniels returning from a knee injury in Week 5, Ertz had his worst game of the season. He was targeted just once and didn’t appear to be a part of the Commanders’ offensive game plan. Ertz still logged 30 offensive snaps and operated as Washington’s No. 1 tight end, playing ahead of John Bates (28 snaps) and Ben Sinnott (17 snaps). With both Terry McLaurin (quadriceps) and Noah Brown (groin/knee) sidelined Sunday, Ertz was expected to serve as one of the Commanders’ primary receiving threats but failed to capitalize. He’s likely to operate as Washington’s top tight end again in the Week 6 matchup against the Bears.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_5_2025_EET_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_5_2025_EET_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <h2 id="projected-lineup-for-next-week">Projected Lineup for Next Week</h2> <p><strong>Total Projected Points:</strong> 93.84<br/></p> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_6_2025_EET_projected.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> <th data-field="opponent" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="false">Opponent</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week5"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Week 5 League Recap</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-5_Recap/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Week 5 League Recap"/><published>2025-10-07T18:30:55+00:00</published><updated>2025-10-07T18:30:55+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-5_Recap</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-5_Recap/"><![CDATA[<h3 id="weekly-matchups">Weekly Matchups</h3> <h4 id="emmas-excellent-team--rookie-mistake">Emma’s Excellent Team @ Rookie Mistake</h4> <p><strong>Final Score:</strong> Emma’s Excellent Team 105.14 - 120.40 Rookie Mistake<br/> <strong>Best Performance:</strong> Jared Goff (Rookie Mistake) - 31.62 pts<br/></p> <h4 id="90s-moncon--third-times-the-charm">90s MonCon @ Third Time’s the Charm?</h4> <p><strong>Final Score:</strong> 90s MonCon 159.49 - 165.45 Third Time’s the Charm?<br/> <strong>Best Performance:</strong> Dak Prescott (Third Time’s the Charm?) - 34.28 pts<br/></p> <h4 id="michaels-managable-team--game-of-zones---house-hamlin">Michael’s Managable Team @ Game of Zones - House Hamlin</h4> <p><strong>Final Score:</strong> Michael’s Managable Team 119.91 - 122.87 Game of Zones - House Hamlin<br/> <strong>Best Performance:</strong> Jacory Croskey-Merritt (Game of Zones - House Hamlin) - 26.00 pts<br/></p> <h4 id="mama-daughter-duo--mcconky-donkeys">Mama Daughter Duo @ Mcconky Donkeys</h4> <p><strong>Final Score:</strong> Mama Daughter Duo 120.25 - 129.80 Mcconky Donkeys<br/> <strong>Best Performance:</strong> Baker Mayfield (Mcconky Donkeys) - 41.16 pts<br/></p> <h4 id="americas-team---abbeys-tnt-team">Americas Team @ Abbey’s TNT Team</h4> <p><strong>Final Score:</strong> Americas Team 178.27 - 145.70 Abbey’s TNT Team <br/> <strong>Best Performance:</strong> Sam Darnold (Americas Team ) - 43.64 pts<br/></p> <h4 id="big-titi-energy--to-infinity-and-bijan">Big Titi Energy @ To Infinity and Bijan!</h4> <p><strong>Final Score:</strong> Big Titi Energy 147.85 - 132.22 To Infinity and Bijan!<br/> <strong>Best Performance:</strong> C.J.

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="cooper-rush-qb">Cooper Rush (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Rush led the Ravens on a decent first drive that resulted in a field goal, completing all five of his pass attempts for 59 yards. Things imploded from there, however, as the Ravens turned in consecutive three-and-outs to end the first half before Rush threw three picks in the final two quarters. The one positive is that Rush was able to complete a long pass to Zay Flowers, salvaging the star receiver’s fantasy day. Rush could be lined up for a Week 6 start against the Rams, pending Lamar Jackson’s (hamstring) recovery.</p> <h4 id="dalton-kincaid-te">Dalton Kincaid (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Buffalo’s offense looked out of sync for much of the game, but Kincaid was a bright spot. He recorded the first 100-yard receiving performance of his career in both regular-season and postseason contests, powered by a very efficient effort on six targets. Kincaid caught three passes of at least 20 yards, matching his total from the first four games of the season. Kincaid has also earned exactly six targets in three of his last four games, making him reliably involved in one of the most efficient offenses in the league.</p> <h4 id="dj-moore-wr">DJ Moore (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The 28-year-old took a back seat to Rome Odunze (4-69-1) yet again, as a changing of the guard appears to have taken place in Chicago’s receiver room. Moore still possesses a consistent role in new head coach Ben Johnson’s offense, garnering five to six targets on a weekly basis, but expectations need to be tempered even if QB Caleb Williams takes a big step forward coming out of Chicago’s upcoming Week 5 bye.</p> <h4 id="jake-browning-qb">Jake Browning (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> “We’ll see,” Taylor said when questioned about Browning starting at Green Bay. Taylor added that he’s evaluating everything. When coaches start to distance themselves from the quarterback, it tends to signal an upcoming change. Browning has been downright horrific under center in three starts since Joe Burrow’s toe injury. Browning completely bottomed out against the Lions on Sunday, throwing three more interceptions to push his season total to eight in just four appearances. He padded his stats late in garbage time. The Bengals haven’t even been competitive the last three weeks with Browning at quarterback. Other options currently in the organization are Brett Rypien, Mike White and Sean Clifford. It’s a dire situation.</p> <h4 id="tee-higgins-wr">Tee Higgins (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Higgins was unable to record a catch on his first three targets and had only seven yards for the first 55 minutes of game time. He saved his day with a 13-yard catch followed by a two-yard touchdown grab late in the fourth quarter, but it was another disastrous day for the Bengals’ offense led by Jake Browning. Despite his undeniable talent, Higgins is a risky fantasy start every week, but particularly heading into a Week 6 matchup against the Packers.</p> <h4 id="jerome-ford-rb">Jerome Ford (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Ford’s seven touches on offense, 38 yards from scrimmage and 116 combined yards were his most since Week 2, when he was still a factor before Quinshon Judkins became the lead running back. Cleveland’s switch to rookie quarterback Dillon Gabriel was the reason for Ford’s increased touches. To make life easier on Gabriel, the Browns deployed a run-heavy offense and had a 50/50 split between rushes and pass attempts. They also got right tackle Jack Conklin (elbow) back, which helped Cleveland amass a season-high 140 yards on the ground. Barring a Judkins injury, Ford’s days as the lead back are over, but Sunday’s game plan showed how the Browns offense can be competitive.</p> <h4 id="christian-kirk-wr">Christian Kirk (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Kirk had his best day as a Texan due primarily to a 47-yard catch to start the fourth quarter, narrowly missing a touchdown while being taken down at the three-yard line. Houston has spread its targets relatively evenly between several different pass catchers early this season, leaving Kirk with only four targets in consecutive games. That limited volume will hurt his fantasy outlook, though Sunday’s big play was encouraging.</p> <h4 id="cj-stroud-qb">C.J. Stroud (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Stroud faced a thinned version of the Baltimore defense that was missing Kyle Hamilton (groin), Marlon Humphrey (calf) and Chidobe Awuzie (hamstring) in its secondary alone. He took advantage of the good spot, throwing more than three touchdowns for only the second time in his career while completing three passes of at least 20 yards. Stroud was ultimately pulled early in the fourth quarter due to the game being a blowout, but it was a positive fantasy performance and also a good showing for the Houston offense overall.</p> <h4 id="jj-mccarthy-qb">J.J. McCarthy (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Out <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> out</p> <h4 id="demario-douglas-wr">DeMario Douglas (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Douglas, who was on the field for 17 of a possible 60 snaps on offense, per Mike Reiss of ESPN.com, was out-snapped in the contest by fellow WRs Kayshon Boutte (37), Mack Hollins (35) and Stefon Diggs (30). With just seven catches for 30 yards and a TD on 16 targets in five games, Douglas is off the lineup radar in all but the deepest of fantasy formats.</p> <h4 id="juwan-johnson-te">Juwan Johnson (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The tight end produced his worst numbers of 2025, and while the returns of Taysom Hill and Foster Moreau from knee injuries didn’t cut into Johnson’s workload at all – he was on the field for 56 offensive snaps (85 percent) – Spencer Rattler and the Saints’ offense did make an effort to attack downfield more than they had in the first month of the year. That change may have had more to do with the quality of the Giants’ secondary than it did any growth in Rattler’s game, but the window for Johnson to be a reliable fantasy option may be closing rapidly. He’ll try to bounce back in Week 6 against the Patriots.</p> <h4 id="breece-hall-rb">Breece Hall (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The running back briefly left the game in the first half after fumbling in the red zone late in the second quarter, but Hall returned in the second half and racked up some big yardage once again in a losing effort. The 113 rushing yards were a season high for the fourth-year RB, as were the 42 receiving yards, but he’s still looking for his first touchdown of 2025 – something he came agonizing close to in the fourth quarter, when he was tackled just short of the goal line on a 16-yard reception. Hall will look to get into the end zone in Week 6 against a Broncos defense that just gave up a 47-yard receiving TD to Saquon Barkley, but otherwise held him in check.</p> <h4 id="dallas-goedert-te">Dallas Goedert (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Goedert was surprisingly second on the Eagles in targets, but he had the third-fewest receiving yards during an inefficient afternoon against a tough Denver defense. Nevertheless, Goedert got into the end zone for the third time in the last two games on a two-yard catch just past the halfway point of the second quarter. Goedert has all four of his touchdowns this season in the last three games, and although he’s averaging only 8.9 yards per reception, he remains an intriguing option at his position for a favorable road Week 6 matchup against the Giants on Thursday night.</p> <h4 id="zach-charbonnet-rb">Zach Charbonnet (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Charbonnet finished with one less carry than Kenneth Walker (10-86-0) in the loss, but it was the former who punched in Seattle’s only rushing score of the contest. The 24-year-old Charbonnet received seven fewer carries than the starter in his return from a foot injury in Week 4, but Sunday’s near-even split in touches indicates a potential timeshare moving forward. If that trend holds true, then Charbonnet would see a slight bump in value at Walker’s expense heading into next Sunday’s tilt against the Jaguars.</p> <h4 id="kenneth-walker-iii-rb">Kenneth Walker III (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Walker led Seattle in both carries and rushing production in Week 5, but it was backfield mate Zach Charbonnet (9-36-1) who cashed in the team’s only rushing score in the loss. The touch distribution was far closer this time around compared to last week’s seven-carry difference in the latter’s return from injury, confirming the timeshare that exists when both runners are at full strength. Both players are worthy of flex spots in Week 6, even in a timeshare, with Walker being the preferred option for his early-down usage.</p> <h4 id="terry-mclaurin-wr">Terry McLaurin (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> McLaurin has missed the Commanders’ past two games and hasn’t even returned to practice yet, but Quinn’s optimism suggests the star wideout could be on the practice field at some point this week. With McLaurin and Noah Brown (groin/knee) missing the past two contests, Washington has leaned on Deebo Samuel as the unquestioned WR1 while cycling through Luke McCaffrey, Chris Moore, Jaylin Lane and Tay Martin behind Samuel.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_5_2025_BTE_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_5_2025_BTE_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <h2 id="projected-lineup-for-next-week">Projected Lineup for Next Week</h2> <p><strong>Total Projected Points:</strong> 80.45<br/></p> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_6_2025_BTE_projected.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> <th data-field="opponent" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="false">Opponent</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week5"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">To Infinity and Bijan!

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="kyler-murray-qb">Kyler Murray (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Murray missed three offensive snaps in the third quarter of Sunday’s game due to a listed foot injury, but he was able to return and finished with 220 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions on 23-for-31 passing, four carries for 25 yards and a TD and a lost fumble. It marked the first time in five contests this season in which he didn’t toss for a touchdown, and he now has four turnovers (three INTs and the fumble) on the campaign. The Cardinals will kick off preparations for Sunday’s road matchup with the Colts on Wednesday, at which point Murray’s status for Week 6 may begin to come into focus.</p> <h4 id="darnell-mooney-wr">Darnell Mooney (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Mooney was forced out of Sunday’s 34-27 win over the Commanders early in the third quarter due to a hamstring injury, but he’s not expected to miss any further time. He secured his only target for 16 yards before exiting Sunday’s contest. Mooney also missed Week 1 due to a shoulder injury, and across his three appearances this season he’s tallied just seven catches for 79 yards on 16 targets.</p> <h4 id="kyle-pitts-sr-te">Kyle Pitts Sr. (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The tight end put together his best game of the season as QB Michael Penix posted career-best passing numbers, with Pitts hauling in his first TD of the year on a seven-yard toss in the third quarter. Pitts has seen at least five targets in every game so far and delivered a 20-205-1 line on 24 targets heading into Atlanta’s Week 5 bye, putting him on pace for his best campaign since his stunning NFL debut in 2021.</p> <h4 id="mark-andrews-te">Mark Andrews (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Ravens were able to muster very little offense with Cooper Rush at the helm, and Andrews’ line suffered. There were still a few positives to take away from his role, as he tied for second on the team in targets and was more involved than Isaiah Likely. Lamar Jackson’s (hamstring) potential return in Week 6 would significantly improve Andrews’ outlook.</p> <h4 id="keon-coleman-wr">Keon Coleman (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> As a result of missing the first possession, Coleman played just 42 of the Bills’ 68 offensive snaps on the night, with his 62 percent share representing his lowest mark since he logged 51 percent of snaps in Week 2, when Buffalo rested several key players late in a 20-point win over the Jets. McDermott didn’t go into much detail about Coleman’s benching beyond noting that the staff is “looking for more consistency” from the second-year wideout. For his part, Coleman seemed to respond well to the disciplinary decision, as he finished the Week 5 loss with four catches for 23 yards on seven targets, including a two-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter. Look for Coleman’s playing time to tick back up a bit in Week 6 against the Falcons, though quarterback Josh Allen’s tendency to spread the ball around to Buffalo’s pass catchers renders Coleman a volatile option in weekly fantasy lineups.</p> <h4 id="tetairoa-mcmillan-wr">Tetairoa McMillan (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> McMillan led the Panthers in receptions, receiving yards and targets in what is becoming a customary occurrence for the talented rookie. The 2025 first-round pick equaled his career high in receptions while posting his second-highest yardage total to date, and he recorded multiple catches of 20-plus yards for the third time in five contests. The chemistry between McMillan and Bryce Young continues to grow by the game, and the duo will draw a favorable matchup at home against the Cowboys in Week 6 next Sunday afternoon.</p> <h4 id="luther-burden-iii-wr">Luther Burden III (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Aside from Burden’s 101-yard effort in Week 3 against the woeful Dallas defense, he has a total of minus-three yards in his other three games. Until his role in the offense grows, Burden’s floor makes him difficult to place in fantasy lineups.</p> <h4 id="javonte-williams-rb">Javonte Williams (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The former Bronco is having a breakout campaign in Dallas. Williams recorded his first triple-digit rushing performance since Week 13 of his rookie season in 2021, and his first receiving score since Week 10 of 2023, in Sunday’s victory. He’s now found the end zone six times in his first five games as a Cowboy while racking up 525 scrimmage yards, giving him massive momentum heading into a Week 6 clash with the Panthers.</p> <h4 id="josh-jacobs-rb">Josh Jacobs (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Jacobs had only 48 yards at halftime, but he found more room to work as both a runner and receiver in the second half. The highlight of his performance was an 18-yard touchdown early in the fourth quarter, which was one of his three ground gains of 10-plus yards. Jacobs also made an impact as a pass catcher, surpassing 70 receiving yards for the fourth time in his career and second time as a Packer. Sunday night’s performance was also the first time he surpassed 100 total yards in a game this season, though he has found the end zone in three of four contests.</p> <h4 id="nick-chubb-rb">Nick Chubb (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Chubb looked to be losing his grip as the clear leader of the Houston backfield after Week 4, though he out-touched rookie Woody Marks 11-7 in Sunday’s blowout win. Despite Baltimore playing without several of their run-stopping defenders, Chubb was held in check for much of the day. However, he broke loose for a 27-yard touchdown scamper early in the third quarter to account for nearly half of his yardage. The positive game script likely benefitted Chubb relative to Marks, but it appears clear that Chubb will continue to retain a role in the offense in the short term.</p> <h4 id="quentin-johnston-wr">Quentin Johnston (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Johnston coughed up a momentum-killing fumble to end a lengthy drive in the second quarter that derailed both his and his team’s days. The Commanders took over in their territory and promptly drove the ball down the field for a touchdown on the ensuing possession, and the Chargers never recovered. Johnston still finished second in receiving yards for his club on a low-volume passing day. Managers may opt to chalk this up as a dud and continue rolling out the breakout fantasy star in a soft matchup against the Dolphins next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="carson-wentz-qb">Carson Wentz (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Wentz briefly left Sunday’s game against the Browns in London and went to the locker room early just before halftime, but he was under center after the break and was able to finish the contest. The injury was to his left, non-throwing shoulder. With J.J. McCarthy (ankle) likely to return to practice at some point following the Vikings’ upcoming Week 6 bye, McCarthy could be back under center Week 7 against the Eagles.</p> <h4 id="justin-jefferson-wr">Justin Jefferson (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Jefferson paced the Vikings in receptions, receiving yards and targets on the day, turning in his second consecutive 100-yard effort in the process. His final reception of the contest was especially critical, as he came down with a 21-yard grab to take the ball to the Browns’ 27 yard-line with under two minutes remaining on Minnesota’s game-winning drive. Jefferson has displayed excellent chemistry with fill-in signal-caller Carson Wentz over the last pair of contests, but J.J. McCarthy (ankle) may be set to return to action when the Vikings come out of a Week 6 bye to host the Eagles on Sunday, Oct. 19.</p> <h4 id="treveyon-henderson-rb">TreVeyon Henderson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Henderson finished as New England’s leading rusher as part of a three-player committee, but it was Rhamondre Stevenson who cashed in both of the team’s short rushing scores Sunday. The latter also coughed up his third fumble of the season, which could cut into Stevenson’s playing time even after making two trips to the end zone. That potential scenario could open up more touches for Henderson going forward, though so far he has seen his fantasy value thwarted by the three-way timeshare. Until he has an uptick in usage, the second-round rookie will be stuck as a deep-league option.</p> <h4 id="justin-fields-qb">Justin Fields (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> His final numbers look good, but both TDs came in the fourth quarter after the game was well out of reach, and the Dallas pass rush gave Fields fits all afternoon as he got sacked five times and took another nine QB hits. Fields has produced multiple scores in back-to-back games since returning from a concussion, but he’ll remain a volatile fantasy option in Week 6 against a tough Broncos defense.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_5_2025_TIB_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_5_2025_TIB_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <h2 id="projected-lineup-for-next-week">Projected Lineup for Next Week</h2> <p><strong>Total Projected Points:</strong> 123.05<br/></p> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_6_2025_TIB_projected.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> <th data-field="opponent" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="false">Opponent</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week5"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Mama Daughter Duo Week 5 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-5-JST/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mama Daughter Duo Week 5 Report"/><published>2025-10-07T18:30:53+00:00</published><updated>2025-10-07T18:30:53+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-5-JST</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-5-JST/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Mama Daughter Duo Lost against Mcconky Donkeys 120.25-129.80<br/> Current Standing: #9<br/> Playoff Chances: 48.7%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 91.1%<br/> Best Performer: Christian McCaffrey (23.90 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="emari-demercado-rb">Emari Demercado (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Demercado was expected to see an expanded role in the absence of Trey Benson (knee), but Michael Carter dominated opportunities out of the backfield. Demercado’s lack of involvement as a pass catcher was particularly surprising, as he was not targeted. He looked to have made the case for a more expanded role with a long 72-yard touchdown run early in the fourth quarter, but he fumbled on a premature celebration before crossing the goal line for a touchback. The Cardinals still gave him one additional touch before the end of the game, but the key error isn’t likely to help his role heading into a Week 6 matchup against the Colts.</p> <h4 id="michael-penix-jr-qb">Michael Penix Jr. (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> After a rough Week 3 performance on the road in Carolina, Penix returned home in Week 4 and looked much more composed, topping his prior career high in yardage by one as he delivered his first multi-TD effort of 2025. The second-year QB hit Drake London for a five-yard score in the first quarter and Kyle Pitts for a seven-yard touchdown in the third, while both London and Bijan Robinson eclipsed the century mark in receiving yards, during a game in which Atlanta never trailed. Penix will get a week off for the Falcons’ bye before facing a tough test in Week 6 against the Bills.</p> <h4 id="dandre-swift-rb">D’Andre Swift (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Swift was limited during the practice week with a hip injury that had him listed as questionable leading up to Sunday’s kickoff. The veteran RB suited up and rewarded fantasy managers with his second trip to the end zone in four games this season. The Bears placed no restrictions on Swift, handing him 14 of its 18 running back carries in the win. He has been generating just enough value on a weekly basis to warrant flex consideration in most formats, but he won’t be available in Week 5 with the Bears on a bye, making Week 6 the next time Swift will be in action.</p> <h4 id="caleb-williams-qb">Caleb Williams (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Williams also put two balls on the ground, but he was fortunately able to recover both of his fumbles. The sophomore QB was coming off his best game of the season against the Cowboys, but he reverted to inconsistent form Sunday. We have seen flashes of brilliance from Williams in new head coach Ben Johnson’s scheme, but he still isn’t polished enough to be relied upon regularly. With the Bears entering their bye, Williams’ next action will come in Week 6 on Oct. 13 against the Commanders on Monday Night Football.</p> <h4 id="rome-odunze-wr">Rome Odunze (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Odunze’s scoring onslaught continued when he gutted the Raiders’ secondary for a 27-yard touchdown on Chicago’s first possession of the second half. The breakout fantasy star has generated five touchdowns during his impressive four-game scoring streak to kick off the season. Odunze’s eight targets Sunday were on par with his 8.8 average through four weeks, giving fantasy managers a reliable WR1 asset so far. The talented sophomore will attempt to extend his scoring streak when the Bears resume play against the Commanders in Week 6 on Oct. 13 following the team’s upcoming bye.</p> <h4 id="travis-kelce-te">Travis Kelce (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Kelce finally put it all together for his managers Week 5, producing his best fantasy score through five starts. The 35-year-old finished with a season-high seven receptions while scoring his second touchdown of the campaign. Even with his slow start to the season, Kelce is providing enough of a floor for fantasy managers with a 22-243-2 receiving line in 2025. Up next for the Chiefs will be a home tilt against a hot Lions squad on Sunday Night Football in Week 6.</p> <h4 id="hunter-henry-te">Hunter Henry (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Henry ripped off a pair of 20-plus yard receptions in order to check in as the Patriots’ second-leading receiver despite finishing with just the two receptions Sunday. The veteran starter failed to extend his modest scoring streak to three games on a night when the passing offense accounted for zero touchdowns. Henry has been a pleasant surprise in fantasy crossing the quarter point of the regular season, producing a 17-250-3 receiving line heading into a Week 6 matchup against the Saints next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="chris-olave-wr">Chris Olave (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The catches and targets were both team highs, but Olave’s output was overshadowed by an 87-yard TD by Rashid Shaheed in the second quarter that sparked the Saints’ offense to life. Olave remains the the top option for QB Spencer Rattler, but his volume hasn’t resulted in any big performances yet in 2025 – despite seeing double-digit targets in four of five games and 53 looks in total, he sports just a 33-244-1 line, and Sunday’s 59 receiving yards were actually his season high. He’ll try to make a bigger impact in Week 6 against the Patriots.</p> <h4 id="devonta-smith-wr">DeVonta Smith (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Smith shook off a highly undesirable matchup on paper to produce team-best totals in receptions, receiving yards and targets on the afternoon, as well as a season-long 52-yard catch. The Eagles’ unusual pass-centric approach Sunday certainly helped Smith’s numbers, but even on lower-volume days for the air attack, Smith has been the more consistent producer between him and A.J. Brown by far through Philadelphia’s first five games. Smith will take a 25-272-1 receiving line on 30 targets into a favorable Week 6 road matchup against the Giants on Thursday night.</p> <h4 id="jalen-hurts-qb">Jalen Hurts (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Despite the Broncos’ standout secondary and the fact they held a lead for a significant portion of the game, the Eagles curiously took a pass-centric approach Sunday, affording Saquon Barkley a scant six carries. Hurts recorded season highs in completions, pass attempts and passing yards, while also recording multiple touchdown tosses for the third consecutive game by connecting with Dallas Goedert (two yards) and Barkley (47 yards) in the second and third quarters, respectively. However, Hurts also took a season-high six sacks, and he threw incomplete on back-to-back plays from the Broncos’ 29-yard line to finish the game. Hurts was also much less involved than usual as a runner, but he draws an excellent matchup on a short week when the Eagles visit the Giants on Thursday night to kick off Week 6.</p> <h4 id="kaleb-johnson-rb">Kaleb Johnson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Jaylen Warren’s (knee) absence opened up a lot of opportunity in the Pittsburgh backfield. Kenneth Gainwell was the primary back and performed well, though Johnson did see the most significant opportunity of his rookie season. He was servicable in the role, picking up 14 yards on the ground on a drive early in the fourth quarter to help the Steelers to a field goal. Johnson isn’t likely to see much of a role when Pittsburgh returns to the field in Week 6, but it was a small step forward after a poor start to his rookie campaign.</p> <h4 id="dk-metcalf-wr">DK Metcalf (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Metcalf found the end zone in his third straight game while also tallying his first 100-yard receiving game as a Steeler. He did the majority of his damage on an 80-yard touchdown early in the second quarter, which came nearly entirely after the catch. Metcalf continues to be Aaron Rodgers’ favorite target among the downfield pass catchers, and he has at least 80 receiving yards in half of his four games in his nascent Steelers tenure.</p> <h4 id="rachaad-white-rb">Rachaad White (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> White got the spot-start in place of injured starter Bucky Irving (foot/shoulder) on Sunday, commanding 14 of the 18 carries Tampa Bay gave to its running backs in the win. The 26-year-old White masked an inefficient day on the ground (2.9 YPC) with a pair of trips to the end zone in a strong overall fantasy performance. Initial reports hinted that Irving could also miss next Sunday’s tilt against the 49ers, a scenario that would unlock another week of fantasy utility for White in Week 6.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_5_2025_JST_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_5_2025_JST_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <h2 id="projected-lineup-for-next-week">Projected Lineup for Next Week</h2> <p><strong>Total Projected Points:</strong> 104.34<br/></p> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_6_2025_JST_projected.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> <th data-field="opponent" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="false">Opponent</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week5"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Mcconky Donkeys Week 5 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-5-KTT/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mcconky Donkeys Week 5 Report"/><published>2025-10-07T18:30:53+00:00</published><updated>2025-10-07T18:30:53+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-5-KTT</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-5-KTT/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Mcconky Donkeys Won against Mama Daughter Duo 129.80-120.25<br/> Current Standing: #7<br/> Playoff Chances: 48.9%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 88.3%<br/> Best Performer: Baker Mayfield (41.16 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="tyler-allgeier-rb">Tyler Allgeier (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Bijan Robinson had a massive day with 21 touches, a career-high 181 scrimmage yards and a rushing TD of his own, but Allgeier still made an impact with a 15-yard score late in the third quarter. It was the fourth-year RB’s second touchdown of the season, and despite his backup role he’s been able to carve out some fantasy value behind Robinson, turning 41 carries through four weeks into 155 rushing yards. The Falcons will be on bye in Week 5, but Allgeier’s volume in Week 6 could depend on whether the team can keep things close against the Bills.</p> <h4 id="david-njoku-te">David Njoku (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Njoku was Dillon Gabriel’s favorite pass catcher, as Njoku led the team in targets, receptions and yards. His biggest contribution was a nine-yard touchdown catch late in the third quarter – his first of the season – and he also chipped in an impressive leaping catch just before halftime that went for 17 yards. This was by far Njoku’s most productive performance of the season and was a positive first showing with Gabriel.</p> <h4 id="evan-engram-te">Evan Engram (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Engram finished second in receptions and targets on an afternoon when Bo Nix spread the ball around to nine different pass catchers overall. The veteran tight end also scored his first touchdown in a Broncos uniform on an 11-yard catch just before the halfway point of the fourth quarter, and his receiving yardage total was a new season high. Engram has played a more short-area role than may have initially been expected upon his signing with Denver this offseason, but his upside keeps him a viable consideration at what can be a difficult position for reliable fantasy production.</p> <h4 id="troy-franklin-wr">Troy Franklin (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Franklin was a distant second in receiving yards to Courtland Sutton on the afternoon, and he tied for third in targets while recording a two-point conversion following Evan Engram’s fourth-quarter touchdown grab. Franklin, Bo Nix’s former Oregon teammate, has no fewer than four and as many as nine targets over Denver’s first five games, but he’s posted 44 receiving yards or fewer in three of those contests. Franklin will likely remain a relatively middling fantasy option in a Week 6 matchup against the Jets in London.</p> <h4 id="joe-mixon-rb">Joe Mixon (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Out <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Caserio’s comments during his press conference mark the first time that a member of the Houston brass has addressed Mixon’s status since the start of the regular season. The veteran running back was placed on the non-football injury list ahead of training camp after getting hurt during an individual workout in the spring, and the Texans have been non-committal on a timeline for his return ever since. Given that the Texans aren’t yet hinting that Mixon will even resume practicing in the near future, the 29-year-old doesn’t look like he’s on track to be an option in the Houston backfield until late in the season, if at all. The Texans are likely to continue to lean on a timeshare of Nick Chubb and rookie Woody Marks at running back for the foreseeable future.</p> <h4 id="brian-thomas-jr-wr">Brian Thomas Jr. (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Thomas finished as the Jaguars’ leader in receptions, receiving yards and targets, holding the top spot in the middle category for the second consecutive week. His final catch of the night was the most critical, as he recorded a 33-yard grab on Jacksonville’s game-winning drive and then drew a pass interference penalty that wiped out an interception four plays later. Thomas’ yardage tally was also a new season high for the second-year wideout, who’s yet to have his first true breakout effort in head coach Liam Coen’s offense but has put together his two best all-around performances this season in the last pair of contests. Thomas will take a 16-244-0 line into a Week 6 home matchup against a Seahawks squad that just conceded a 163-yard, one-touchdown day to the Buccaneers’ Emeka Egbuka on Sunday.</p> <h4 id="isiah-pacheco-rb">Isiah Pacheco (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Pacheco excelled on a per-carry basis (5.1 YPC) while garnering the most targets out of the backfield for Kansas City on Monday. That’s where the good news ends, as fellow RB Kareem Hunt found the end zone twice on his seven rushing attempts in the loss. Pacheco’s fantasy value continues to be doused by the presence of his veteran teammate in an even timeshare, a scenario that should continue repeating itself against the Lions on Sunday.</p> <h4 id="ladd-mcconkey-wr">Ladd McConkey (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> McConkey responded well coming off of his worst receiving line as a pro last week (1-11-0), grabbing five receptions and his first touchdown of the 2025 season in a losing effort. The 23-year-old finished behind only Keenan Allen (nine) in targets Sunday, maintaining the former’s healthy average of 6.8 targets per game through five weeks. McConkey will attempt to ride the momentum from Sunday’s strong fantasy performance into a road tilt against the Dolphins in Week 6.</p> <h4 id="devon-achane-rb">De’Von Achane (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Achane came into the interconference battle with elevated expectations, considering the struggles of the Panthers against the run and the fact Tyreek Hill’s (IR, knee) absence was expected to open up even more pass-catching opportunities for the versatile back. The latter partly did come to fruition, as Achane recorded his third-highest reception and target tallies of the season and salvaged his fantasy day with an impressive 10-yard touchdown catch on the first play of the second quarter. However, the speedy back was surprisingly stymied on the ground, leading to a season-low rushing yardage total. Achane’s chances of a rebound Week 6 are kind of bleak as well, considering he’ll face off with a talented Chargers defense in South Florida.</p> <h4 id="darius-slayton-wr">Darius Slayton (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> After tweaking his hamstring in Sunday’s 26-14 loss to the Saints, Slayton could be hard-pressed to make a full recovery from the injury ahead of the Giants’ Week 6 matchup with the Eagles on Thursday night. Daboll suggested that Slayton is trending toward being a game-time decision for Thursday, though the Giants will wait until Wednesday before formally giving the wideout a designation heading into the contest. If Slayton can’t rally to play on a short week, the Giants would be left with Wan’Dale Robinson, Jalin Hyatt, Beaux Collins and Gunner Olszewski as their available options at receiver. New York has three receivers on its practice squad (Lil’Jordan Humphrey, Ihmir Smith-Marsette and Dalen Cambre) as potential candidates for elevation in Week 6.</p> <h4 id="wandale-robinson-wr">Wan’Dale Robinson (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Jaxson Dart wasn’t able to stretch the field much in his first game working without Malik Nabers (knee), and while tight ends Theo Johnson (6-33-2 on seven targets) and Daniel Bellinger (4-52-0 on four targets) saw more volume than usual, Robinson was able to get his share of those short passes as well. The veteran slot receiver has caught multiple passes in four of five games so far in 2025, posting a 23-267-1 line on 34 targets, and he should continue to have a solid PPR floor given the team’s lack of other receiving options. However, Robinson may not have much of a ceiling in a Week 6 clash with the Eagles.</p> <h4 id="aaron-rodgers-qb">Aaron Rodgers (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Steelers played from ahead for most of the game, so Rodgers attempted only eight passes in the second half. He managed to move the offense efficiently when asked, however, with the key to his day being an explosive 80-yard touchdown to DK Metcalf early in the second quarter. This was a return to form for Rodgers, as he had only a 3:3 TD:INT while combining to throw for 332 yards across his last two games. Pittsburgh is likely to continue to rely on its run game and short passes to move the offense, which will lead to inconsistent fantasy results for Rodgers.</p> <h4 id="mike-evans-wr">Mike Evans (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Out <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> out</p> <h4 id="baker-mayfield-qb">Baker Mayfield (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Mayfield flirted with perfection in a masterful performance that saw him miss just four pass attempts while committing zero turnovers. The 30-year-old was especially sharp in the clutch when he led a pair of five-play drives that took up a little over one minute of game clock to give Tampa Bay the 10 points needed to secure victory. The loss of star WR Mike Evans (hamstring) hasn’t hampered Mayfield and the passing offense, as the signal-caller is averaging 334.0 passing yards with a pair of touchdowns in the two games sans Evans. Mayfield will look to build off of the momentum of his cleanest outing when the Buccaneers host the 49ers next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="tyler-lockett-wr">Tyler Lockett (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> There were some positives to take away from the performance, as Lockett logged a season-high 74 percent of offensive snaps and drew four targets for the second consecutive game. However, he was unable to connect with Cam Ward, who has struggled in his first four starts as a pro. Like nearly every Titans’ pass catcher, Lockett is an unreliable fantasy option.</p> <h4 id="jayden-daniels-qb">Jayden Daniels (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Daniels returned from a two-week absence due to a knee injury in order to lead his team to its third win of the season. The 24-year-old was sporting a brace on his left knee, but it did not appear to limit the quarterback’s mobility on any of his eight carries Sunday. Daniels is averaging 221.3 passing yards and 41.3 rushing yards with four touchdowns to no interceptions in three 2025 starts. The dual-threat sophomore could be primed for his finest fantasy outing under the bright lights of Monday Night Football in Week 6 when the Commanders host a Bears defense that is surrendering 389.0 yards of offense to opponents this season.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_5_2025_KTT_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_5_2025_KTT_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <h2 id="projected-lineup-for-next-week">Projected Lineup for Next Week</h2> <p><strong>Total Projected Points:</strong> 122.56<br/></p> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_6_2025_KTT_projected.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> <th data-field="opponent" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="false">Opponent</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week5"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Americas Team Week 5 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-5-RRT/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Americas Team Week 5 Report"/><published>2025-10-07T18:30:53+00:00</published><updated>2025-10-07T18:30:53+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-5-RRT</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-5-RRT/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Americas Team Won against Abbey’s TNT Team 178.27-145.70<br/> Current Standing: #8<br/> Playoff Chances: 39.3%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 91.4%<br/> Best Performer: Sam Darnold (43.64 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="trey-mcbride-te">Trey McBride (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Cardinals’ offense completely stalled in the second half, with Kyler Murray throwing for only 78 yards in the final two quarters. That led to a muted stat line for McBride, who still led the team in targets and was tied for the lead in receptions. However, his longest catch of the day went for only 12 yards, and he’s now been held below 55 yards in each of his last three games.</p> <h4 id="deandre-hopkins-wr">DeAndre Hopkins (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Despite the Ravens’ offensive struggles Sunday, Hopkins still capitalized on his opportunities. He caught both of his targets for 29- and 17-yard gains. This season, Hopkins has been one of the most efficient receivers in football. He has caught seven of nine targets for 158 yards and two touchdowns. The issue is that Hopkins is playing a small fraction of the snaps. His 11 snaps Sunday were more of the same, as he hasn’t topped 20 snaps in a game this season. With Tylan Wallace and Rashad Bateman struggling, there’s a case to get Hopkins more involved in the offense. However, the offensive outlook in Baltimore is murky for as long as Lamar Jackson is sidelined.</p> <h4 id="chuba-hubbard-rb">Chuba Hubbard (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable</p> <h4 id="jamarr-chase-wr">Ja’Marr Chase (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Chase and the entire Bengals’ offense got off to a slow start, as he had only four catches on eight targets for 31 yards at halftime. That changed quickly in the final two quarters, as Chase took his two targets for 15- and 64-yard touchdowns. The latter was particularly impressive, as he beat Amik Robertson on a double move to get wide open behind the defense. Chase’s weekly outlook is hurt by the subpar play of Jake Browning, though Chase is talented enough to overcome the poor offensive environment and showcased that ability in Sunday’s loss.</p> <h4 id="david-montgomery-rb">David Montgomery (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Montgomery made his initial impact in the game as a passer, taking a direct snap and delivering a three-yard touchdown pass to Brock Wright early in the second quarter. He got going as a rusher in the second half, racking up 12 carries for 62 yards – highlighted by an eight-yard touchdown run midway through the third quarter. While it wasn’t his most efficient performance, Montgomery bounced back from a poor Week 4 showing while logging a season-high 18 carries.</p> <h4 id="dalton-schultz-te">Dalton Schultz (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Schultz was C.J. Stroud’s favorite target in the first half, recording four receptions on four targets for 53 yards. Schultz played a key role on multiple scoring drives for Houston, recording 11- and 12-yard receptions to keep a pair of possessions alive on third down before logging a 21-yard catch to set up a touchdown just before halftime. This was Schultz’s highest yardage total of the season, and he has five receptions in three consecutive contests.</p> <h4 id="josh-downs-wr">Josh Downs (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> On a day when Daniel Jones spread the ball around in customary fashion, Downs’ six receptions qualified as a team-high figure. The third-year wideout’s yardage tally was also a new season high, although as his 9.0 yards per reception corroborates, Downs continues to be utilized almost exclusively in a short-area role. While his upside remains capped as a result, Downs particularly holds appeal in PPR formats heading into a Week 6 home matchup against the Cardinals next Sunday afternoon.</p> <h4 id="travis-etienne-jr-rb">Travis Etienne Jr. (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Etienne logged his lowest carry total of the campaign, which also led to a new low-water mark in rushing yards. The talented back also failed to record a double-digit-yardage run for the first time in five contests, but he reemerged in the passing game to an extent after mustering just a single reception for one yard on four targets in the previous pair of contests. Etienne draws another challenging matchup when the Seahawks pay a visit for a Week 6 interconference matchup Sunday afternoon.</p> <h4 id="matthew-stafford-qb">Matthew Stafford (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Stafford averaged an impressive 8.3 yards per attempt and facilitated four tallies of over 65 receiving yards for his arsenal of pass catchers. The veteran signal-caller connected with Kyren Williams (14 and eight yards) and Puka Nacua (one yard) for his trio of scoring tosses, his second consecutive such tally and fourth straight of multiple TD passes. Stafford’s last two games have seen him put the ball up over 40 times apiece, which is a significant departure from his first three contests of the campaign when he averaged 31.6 pass attempts per contest. Stafford will next take aim at an injury-ravaged Ravens defense in a Week 6 road matchup on Sunday, Oct. 12.</p> <h4 id="rhamondre-stevenson-rb">Rhamondre Stevenson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Stevenson led New England’s three-headed backfield with his seven carries Sunday, rewarding fantasy managers with a pair of trips to the end zone. The bad news for the veteran rusher was that his ball security woes continued with his third lost fumble in as many games. Stevenson’s case of fumblitis didn’t cost his team a shot at victory like it did in Week 3 against the Steelers. That said, it wouldn’t be surprising if the Patriots lean more heavily on TreVeyon Henderson and Antonio Gibson going forward if Stevenson is unable to correct his turnover issues.</p> <h4 id="spencer-rattler-qb">Spencer Rattler (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The second-year QB led the Saints to their first win of the season with another relatively quiet, but turnover-free, performance. Rattler was able to pick his spots against a poor Giants secondary, connecting with Rashid Shaheed on an 87-yard catch-and-run TD in the second quarter. Rattler doesn’t appear to be in much danger of losing his starting job to rookie Tyler Shough despite the team’s 1-4 record, posting a 6:1 TD:INT and 67.2 percent completion rate, albeit with a poor 5.6 YPA. He’ll look to build on this performance in Week 6 against the Patriots.</p> <h4 id="aj-brown-wr">A.J. Brown (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Brown finished second in receptions and third in targets during a busy day for the Eagles’ passing attack, but he averaged just 8.6 yards per grab against Denver’s tough defense. Brown’s reception and receiving yardage tallies were his second highest of the season, but through five games, he has just a single touchdown catch and only one game of more than 43 receiving yards as well. Brown won’t have to wait long for his next opportunity to put an end to that unfavorable trend, as he draws a favorable Week 6 road matchup against the Giants on Thursday night.</p> <h4 id="brian-robinson-jr-rb">Brian Robinson Jr. (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Starter Christian McCaffrey gobbled up a season high 76 snaps on offense (88 percent) Thursday, leaving just scraps for Robinson, even with the 49ers missing several key offensive players on a short week. The veteran backup finished with his worst per-carry average (2.4 yards) since being traded to San Francisco this preseason. Robinson’s lack of involvement in the passing game (three targets) coupled with zero trips to the end zone through five appearances make him a poor fantasy option Week 6 against the Buccaneers.</p> <h4 id="cooper-kupp-wr">Cooper Kupp (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Kupp produced his second-best receiving line as a member of the Seahawks while finishing in a tie with Jaxon Smith-Njigba for the team lead in targets (nine) Sunday. The 32-year-old Kupp was held out of the end zone for the fifth time in as many games this season, resulting in a useful PPR score and not much else. The former Los Angeles Ram has carved out a decent role as the Seahawks’ No. 2 receiver, but he lacks the upside that once made him a must-start option in fantasy. Kupp’s upside is capped as a flex option for a Week 6 matchup against the Jaguars.</p> <h4 id="sam-darnold-qb">Sam Darnold (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Darnold’s untimely interception in the closing moments of Sunday’s narrow loss could not erase the gaudy passing numbers he provided fantasy managers Sunday. It was the 28-year-old’s first start this season eclipsing the 300-yard mark in passing, and the most comfortable he has looked running Seattle’s offense through five starts. Darnold will attempt to combine strong results with a Seahawks win in a road matchup against the Jaguars next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="jaxon-smith-njigba-wr">Jaxon Smith-Njigba (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Smith-Njigba put it all together with his first game of the season recording 100 or more yards while also nabbing a touchdown. The outpouring of fantasy production was a welcome sight after the star receiver experienced a gradual reduction in targets from the high-water mark of 13 he set back in Week 1. JSN bumped his receiving line up to 34-534-2 through five appearances as he settles in as QB Sam Darnold’s most-trusted option in the passing game. Managers can start Smith-Njigba with confidence heading into a Week 6 road matchup against the Jaguars next Sunday.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_5_2025_RRT_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_5_2025_RRT_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <h2 id="projected-lineup-for-next-week">Projected Lineup for Next Week</h2> <p><strong>Total Projected Points:</strong> 133.59<br/></p> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_6_2025_RRT_projected.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> <th data-field="opponent" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="false">Opponent</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week5"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Abbey’s TNT Team Week 5 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-5-ARV/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Abbey’s TNT Team Week 5 Report"/><published>2025-10-07T18:30:52+00:00</published><updated>2025-10-07T18:30:52+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-5-ARV</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-5-ARV/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Abbey’s TNT Team 🧨 Lost against Americas Team 145.70-178.27<br/> Current Standing: #5<br/> Playoff Chances: 66.6%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 93.0%<br/> Best Performer: Emeka Egbuka (27.80 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="bijan-robinson-rb">Bijan Robinson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The 181 scrimmage yards were a career high for Robinson, as he hit the century mark in receiving yards for the second time in four games to begin the season. The third-year RB scored on a 14-yard run in the second quarter, his first TD on the ground in 2025, and he’s topped 100 combined yards in every game so far. Robinson has amassed 314 rushing yards and 274 receiving yards through four weeks, earning a well-deserved rest during Atlanta’s Week 5 bye before facing the Bills in Week 6.</p> <h4 id="xavier-legette-wr">Xavier Legette (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Making his return from a two-game absence due to a hamstring injury, Legette made an impact with a seven-yard scoring grab late in the second quarter that ignited a comeback from a 17-0 deficit. Despite the score, the 2024 first-round pick continues to struggle to generate anything resembling useful fantasy production, as he now has a 6-39-1 line on 18 targets through his three games. Bryce Young’s struggles with consistency and accuracy are partly to blame, but Legette isn’t the most inspiring fantasy prospect despite a favorable Week 6 home matchup against the Cowboys next Sunday afternoon.</p> <h4 id="colston-loveland-te">Colston Loveland (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable</p> <h4 id="dylan-sampson-rb">Dylan Sampson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Not much changed for Sampson with the switch from quarterback Joe Flacco to Dillon Gabriel. Sampson’s seven snaps Sunday was the third consecutive game with fewer than 10 for the rookie, whose role has diminished since Quinshon Judkins entered the picture Week 2.</p> <h4 id="jaydon-blue-rb">Jaydon Blue (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> With Miles Sanders (ankle) and KaVontae Turpin (foot) both sidelined, Blue drew into the game-day lineup for the first time but didn’t see much usage. It would likely take an injury to Cowboys lead back Javonte Williams for Blue to get onto the fantasy radar.</p> <h4 id="bo-nix-qb">Bo Nix (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Nix had his fair share of struggles against the Eagles’ talented defense, but he helped lead Denver back from a 17-3 second-half deficit. Nix led a trio of fourth-quarter scoring drives, capping one of them with an 11-yard touchdown pass to Evan Engram and following it up with a two-point conversion toss to Troy Franklin. Nix has at least one touchdown pass in every game thus far this season and has posted his two highest passing yardage totals of the campaign in the last pair of contests heading into a Week 6 trip across the pond to face the Jets in London.</p> <h4 id="kalif-raymond-wr">Kalif Raymond (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Raymond remained on the turf for some time after taking a hit on an 11-yard punt return in second quarter before walking off the field under his own power. His only contribution to Sunday’s box score was the aforementioned return, as he had no targets at the time of his exit.</p> <h4 id="geno-smith-qb">Geno Smith (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The left half of Smith’s stat line looked perfectly acceptable, but the two picks, four sacks and quarterback rating of 18.9 that comprise the rest of his numbers all underscore how difficult the afternoon was. The Raiders’ day actually started off in encouraging fashion via a marathon 16-play, 80-yard drive that consumed 9:50 of the first quarter, but that ultimately culminated in a field goal. The next five possessions would feature a blocked punt, both of Smith’s interceptions, a punt and a missed field goal, helping dig Las Vegas into a hole it couldn’t recover from. Smith has now thrown nine interceptions over his first five games at the helm of the Raiders’ offense, including three contests in which he’s tossed multiple picks. Nevertheless, Smith will continue under center, potentially without Brock Bowers (knee) once again, when the Raiders welcome in the Titans for a favorable Week 6 home clash.</p> <h4 id="kyren-williams-rb">Kyren Williams (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Williams averaged an impressive 4.6 yards per carry with a long gain of 20 yards, but it was via his work as a receiver that he made the biggest impact by far. His reception, receiving yardage and target totals were all season highs, and he added his second and third receiving touchdowns of the campaign on 14- and eight-yard grabs in the second and fourth quarters, respectively. However, the star running back’s night ended on quite the sour note, as he was stuffed on a fourth-and-1 play that ended the game. Williams notably logged 13 more carries than backfield mate Blake Corum in Thursday’s loss, a reminder that the former is still the clear leader of the ground attack heading into a Week 6 road matchup against the Ravens on Sunday, Oct. 12.</p> <h4 id="puka-nacua-wr">Puka Nacua (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Nacua was in the customary position of leading the Rams in receptions and targets while checking in second in receiving yards. The prolific pass catcher also brought in one of Matthew Stafford’s three touchdown passes, recording a one-yard scoring grab with just under four minutes remaining in the third quarter. Nacua now has three consecutive double-digit reception and target totals, and he’s posted both of his touchdowns this season in the last pair of contests. Nacua will remain Stafford’s most reliable target in a Week 6 road matchup against the Ravens on Sunday, Oct. 12.</p> <h4 id="tyreek-hill-wr">Tyreek Hill (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Injured Reserve <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Per Marcel Louis-Jacques of ESPN, Hill – who underwent a major procedure Tuesday to repair his dislocated left knee and multiple torn ligaments, including his ACL – won’t need additional surgery, with agent Drew Rosenhaus indicating afterward that the wideout will play next season, while noting that “the realistic goal is the start of the season.” In Hill’s absence for the rest of the 2025 campaign, Malik Washington and Nick Westbrook-Ikhine are in line to see expanded roles alongside top WR Jaylen Waddle, with Dee Eskridge, Cedrick Wilson and Tahj Washington available to mix in.</p> <h4 id="cade-otton-te">Cade Otton (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Otton set new season highs in targets, receptions and yardage. The veteran starter produced next to nothing over his previous four appearances, literally saddling managers with bagels in the box score for Weeks 1 and 3. The 26-year-old is averaging 4.5 targets in the two games Mike Evans (hamstring) has missed, highlighting a window of elevated usage for the tight end while the team’s star wideout is sidelined. Otton’s strong results immediately put him back on the map at a shallow fantasy position for next Sunday’s tilt against the 49ers.</p> <h4 id="emeka-egbuka-wr">Emeka Egbuka (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Egbuka was unconscious in Sunday’s thrilling victory, catching every ball thrown his way en route to a new career high in receiving yards (163). The standout rookie continued to step up in the absence of Mike Evans (hamstring), who missed his second game recovering from a Week 3 injury. Egbuka produced his second consecutive game with 100-plus yards and a trip to the end zone, proving that he can adequately fill his superstar teammate’s shoes as Tampa Bay’s No. 1 wideout. The Ohio State product is also proving that he can produce WR1 numbers for fantasy managers heading into a matchup against the 49ers next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="calvin-ridley-wr">Calvin Ridley (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Ridley entered Sunday’s game having recorded only 141 yards combined across his first four games of the season. He finally got on track against the Cardinals, accounting for the Titans’ three longest plays from scrimmage with receptions of 47, 38 and 25 yards. His longest two came at particularly opportune times, as he helped set up a touchdown early in the fourth quarter before getting Tennessee into field-goal range to attempt the game-winning kick as time expired. It will still be difficult to consistently trust Ridley given his start to the season, but it was encouraging to see him display some rapport with Cam Ward.</p> <h4 id="deebo-samuel-wr">Deebo Samuel (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Samuel overcame a heel injury during the practice week to lead a shorthanded Washington receiver room Sunday. The star acquisition led his new club in targets, receptions and receiving yards while catching QB Jayden Daniels’ only passing touchdown of the contest. The 29-year-old has turned back the clock in 2025, generating 346 yards of offense and four total touchdowns through five games. Even if No. 1 wideout Terry McLaurin (quadriceps) returns against the Bears next Monday, Samuel’s consistent production makes him a must-start asset in fantasy for Week 6.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_5_2025_ARV_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_5_2025_ARV_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <h2 id="projected-lineup-for-next-week">Projected Lineup for Next Week</h2> <p><strong>Total Projected Points:</strong> 124.02<br/></p> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_6_2025_ARV_projected.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> <th data-field="opponent" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="false">Opponent</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week5"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Michael’s Managable Team Week 5 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-5-MMT/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Michael’s Managable Team Week 5 Report"/><published>2025-10-07T18:30:52+00:00</published><updated>2025-10-07T18:30:52+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-5-MMT</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-5-MMT/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Michael’s Managable Team Lost against Game of Zones - House Hamlin 119.91-122.87<br/> Current Standing: #4<br/> Playoff Chances: 61.2%<br/> Lineup Efficiency: 84.2%<br/> Best Performer: Jake Ferguson (22.15 pts)<br/></p> <pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="khalil-shakir-wr">Khalil Shakir (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Shakir matched his season high of nine targets, though he wasn’t able to turn that into much production. Four of his six catches went for six or fewer yards, leading to his third performance with less than 50 receiving yards on the campaign. Shakir will continue to be a key part of the Buffalo offense, but he’s reliant primarily on yards after the catch or touchdowns for big fantasy performances, with the majority of his opportunity coming in the short areas of the field.</p> <h4 id="harold-fannin-jr-te">Harold Fannin Jr. (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Fannin had a mixed performance in Dillon Gabriel’s first game under center. He was overshadowed by David Njoku – who led the team with nine targets – but was a reliable short-area target for Gabriel. Fannin accounted for the Browns’ first touchdown of the day with a one-yard catch midway through the first quarter, also the first of his career. He hasn’t shown much upside, but Fannin could emerge as a favorite target of Gabriel in the quick-pass game.</p> <h4 id="jake-ferguson-te">Jake Ferguson (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Dak Prescott continues to lean heavily on the tight end while CeeDee Lamb (ankle) is sidelined. Ferguson was on the other end of two of the QB’s four TD passes on the afternoon, hitting paydirt on a 26-yard strike and a one-yard toss in the second quarter as the Cowboys built a 23-3 lead before halftime. Over three games since Lamb went down, Ferguson has compiled a 27-171-3 line on 30 targets, and his seven receptions Sunday were a team high. He’ll look to keep rolling in Week 6 against the Panthers.</p> <h4 id="george-pickens-wr">George Pickens (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The game was more lopsided than the final score might suggest – Dallas took a 30-6 lead into the fourth quarter – and Pickens wasn’t needed for much volume as a result. He made his few looks count, however, burning Sauce Gardner for a 43-yard TD in the third quarter. Since CeeDee Lamb (ankle) got hurt early in Week 3, Pickens has erupted for a 15-259-4 line on 24 targets as Dak Prescott’s most dangerous downfield threat. Whether he’s able to continue that hot streak in Week 6 against the Panthers may depend largely on Lamb’s health.</p> <h4 id="jahmyr-gibbs-rb">Jahmyr Gibbs (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Gibbs has showcased his versatility in the Lions’ offense in the last two games, primarily working as a rusher in Week 4 before being excellent as a pass catcher in Sunday’s win. His touchdown came on an impressive 20-yard yard catch and run on a quick screen, during which he weaved through traffic before barreling through several players to reach the end zone. David Montgomery saw the majority of work in the fourth quarter with Detroit in control of the game, but Gibbs has still found the end zone in four straight games while surpassing 85 scrimmage yards in each of those contests.</p> <h4 id="woody-marks-rb">Woody Marks (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Marks rotated within drives with Nick Chubb for most of the game, but he still ended up with four fewer carries. Neither back was able to get much going, and three of Marks’ seven carries went for one yard or less. While it was a disappointing follow-up to what appeared to be a breakout performance in Week 5, game script didn’t help as Houston pulled most of its offensive starters early in the fourth quarter.</p> <h4 id="michael-pittman-jr-wr">Michael Pittman Jr. (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The veteran receiver finished second on the Colts in receptions during the lopsided victory, and although he averaged only 7.8 yards per catch, he rounded out his production nicely with a four-yard scoring grab late in the first half. Pittman has at least five receptions in four of the first five contests of the season, and although he continues to be used primarily in a short-area role, he’s already recorded four touchdown catches, one more than he tallied across 16 regular-season games in 2024. Pittman will look to continue adding to that total in a Week 6 home matchup against the Cardinals.</p> <h4 id="daniel-jones-qb">Daniel Jones (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Jones’ solid, efficient stat line was a fitting microcosm of what’s come to define his body of work early in his Colts tenure, as the veteran signal-caller once again turned in a mistake-free effort that complemented the exploits of Jonathan Taylor and the defense perfectly. Jones worked with a tight circle of five targets overall, tossing his pair of touchdowns to Tyler Warren (11 yards) and Michael Pittman (four yards). Jones has completed a sharp 71.3 percent of his passes and posted a 6:2 TD:INT through his first five games at the helm of Indianapolis’ offense, and he’s added another three scores on the ground. Jones next takes aim at the Cardinals’ defense in a Week 6 home clash.</p> <h4 id="bhayshul-tuten-rb">Bhayshul Tuten (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Tuten has had his practice reps managed in each of the last three weeks of game prep, but he’s still been available to the Jaguars offense on game days. While Travis Etienne has been a workhorse out of the backfield this season, Tuten has received regular touches, turning 21 carries into 88 yards and one touchdown and three catches (on four targets) for 40 yards and another score through four contests.</p> <h4 id="tre-harris-wr">Tre’ Harris (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Harris actually saw a season high in terms of snap percentage, but the extra work didn’t get the rookie more opportunities. The Chargers could be in a few more favorable passing game scripts with the offensive line in tatters due to injuries, but it has yet to significantly unlock the 2025 second-round pick.</p> <h4 id="justin-herbert-qb">Justin Herbert (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Herbert did not look comfortable in the pocket without starting left tackle Joe Alt (ankle) on Sunday, finishing below 200 yards passing for the first time this season. The 27-year-old was sacked four times while throwing his fourth interception of the season, all of which have come during his current three-game skid. Things got so bad that head coach Jim Harbaugh turned to backup QB Trey Lance in garbage time of Sunday’s loss. Herbert did salvage his fantasy day a bit by providing managers with a season high of 60 yards on the ground. The talented signal-caller will attempt to get his season back on track against the fledgling Dolphins next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="davante-adams-wr">Davante Adams (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Adams edged Puka Nacua by three for the team lead in receiving yards, and he was one target behind his teammate for the top spot in that category as well. Adams’ yardage and target tallies were also his best since Week 2 and second highest of the campaign in both cases. Nacua remains the clear alpha option in the Rams’ air attack, but Adams’ role as the No. 2 receiver is just as clearly delineated heading into a Week 6 road matchup against the Ravens on Sunday, Oct. 12.</p> <h4 id="tj-hockenson-te">T.J. Hockenson (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The veteran tight end continued to play a short-area role and finished as the runner-up in receptions for the Vikings while also tying for second in targets. Hockenson provided some key contributions on the Vikings’ game-winning drive late in the fourth quarter, making two catches for 20 yards during the possession. He has between four and six receptions in his last three games, but he’s yet to top 49 receiving yards in any contest this season heading into the Week 6 bye.</p> <h4 id="drake-maye-qb">Drake Maye (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Maye continued his impressive development in Week 5 despite failing to score a touchdown for the first time this season. The sophomore signal-caller did the dirty work between the 20s, leading a pair of lengthy drives in the second half that RB Rhamondre Stevenson finished off with short rushing scores. Maye is completing an impressive 73.9 percent of his pass attempts through five starts, leading New England to a surprising 3-2 start to the campaign. The North Carolina product should continue offering starter-level production in fantasy in a road tilt against the Saints next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="alvin-kamara-rb">Alvin Kamara (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The 55 scrimmage yards were a season low for Kamara, and it’s the third time in five games to begin the season that he’s failed to reach 60. The veteran back is struggling to make an impact, as defenses haven’t had much reason to fear the Saints’ passing attack, but they could begin to loosen up for Kamara after QB Spencer Rattler hit Rashid Shaheed for an 87-yard TD in Sunday’s win. Kamara will try to rebound in Week 6 against the Patriots.</p> <h4 id="ricky-pearsall-wr">Ricky Pearsall (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_5_2025_MMT_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_5_2025_MMT_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <h2 id="projected-lineup-for-next-week">Projected Lineup for Next Week</h2> <p><strong>Total Projected Points:</strong> 128.43<br/></p> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_6_2025_MMT_projected.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> <th data-field="opponent" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="false">Opponent</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week5"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry></feed>
