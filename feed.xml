</code></pre> <hr/> <h2 id="-player-report">🏥 Player Report</h2> <h3 id="-cooper-rush-qb">🟢 Cooper Rush (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Rush drew his second straight start in the absence of Lamar Jackson (hamstring). He ran a decent first possession that resulted in a field goal, completing both of his passes for 12 yards while also scrambling for seven. However, he was intercepted on Baltimore's following drive and the team had several additional miscues before Rush was finally pulled after losing a fumble deep in Rams territory late in the third quarter. Jackson is expected back in Week 8 following Baltimore's bye, and Rush could be in danger of being demoted to the third-string quarterback. </div> <h3 id="-dj-moore-wr">🟡 DJ Moore (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> During Monday's 25-24 win at Washington, Moore paid a visit to the sideline tent but played through whatever was bothering him, logging 60 of 64 offensive snaps (94 percent) and hauling in three of five targets for 42 yards and two carries for 10 yards. Afterward, he was admitted to a local hospital for a precautionary medical evaluation, and coach Ben Johnson relayed to Scott Bair of Marquee Sports Network on Tuesday that Moore was dealing with a groin injury. The Bears listed hip and groin issues as the reasons for Moore's DNP at Wednesday's walkthrough, so his status bears watching in advance of Sunday's game against the Saints. </div> <h3 id="-roschon-johnson-rb">🟢 Roschon Johnson (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Though Johnson has now suited up four games this season, Monday marked the first time that he's touched the ball in 2025. His role is expected to be contained mostly to special teams while rookie Kyle Monangai serves as the Bears' No. 2 running back behind D'Andre Swift. </div> <h3 id="-tee-higgins-wr">🟢 Tee Higgins (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> This was far from a standout performance from Higgins, but it did represent his highest reception and yardage totals of the season. He narrowly missed out on a more impressive fantasy showing, as he was dragged down at Green Bay's one-yard line on a 13-yard reception midway through the third quarter. Higgins was evaluated for a concussion due to the tackle on that same play but was cleared to return without missing a full possession. The Cincinnati offense is still likely to be inconsistent, but Joe Flacco prioritized getting the ball to Higgins and Ja'Marr Chase in his Bengals debut, which has improved the outlook for the star pass catchers. </div> <h3 id="-joe-flacco-qb">🟢 Joe Flacco (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Flacco had a quick turnaround after being traded to Cincinnati on Tuesday. Given that and a tough road matchup, he performed relatively well. He led three scoring drives in the second half, highlighted by a two-yard touchdown pass to Tanner Hudson and a 19-yard scoring toss to Ja'Marr Chase. This marked Flacco's first multi-touchdown performance across five starts in 2025, and he should be able to put up respectable numbers with the help of Chase and Tee Higgins. </div> <h3 id="-jerome-ford-rb">🟢 Jerome Ford (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Ever since the Browns selected two running backs in the 2025 NFL Draft, it felt like Ford could be flipped at the deadline, which falls on Nov. 4, a day after Week 9 wraps. That Cleveland is 1-5 and seemingly playing for the future only cements that notion. He's primarily served as a third-down back since rookie Quinshon Judkins was established as the starter earlier this season. Lately, Dylan Sampson, a fourth-round draft pick in 2025, has rotated in with Ford, which sets up a scenario where Cleveland trades Ford and allots more playing time to Sampson. </div> <h3 id="-christian-kirk-wr">🟢 Christian Kirk (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Kirk had his best day as a Texan due primarily to a 47-yard catch to start the fourth quarter, narrowly missing a touchdown while being taken down at the three-yard line. Houston has spread its targets relatively evenly between several different pass catchers early this season, leaving Kirk with only four targets in consecutive games. That limited volume will hurt his fantasy outlook, though Sunday's big play was encouraging. </div> <h3 id="-jj-mccarthy-qb">🟡 J.J. McCarthy (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> McCarthy thus has logged an official practice for the first time since suffering a high right-ankle sprain Week 2 against the Falcons. Coach Kevin O'Connell told Alec Lewis of The Athletic earlier Wednesday that both McCarthy and Carson Wentz (shoulder) were slated to take part in drills coming out of the Vikings' Week 6 bye, but he also wasn't ready to name a starting quarterback for Sunday's game against the Eagles. Wentz himself was a full participant Wednesday, so he appears to be a step ahead of McCarthy on that front, though the latter added that his ankle is "getting there. I wouldn't say it's 100 percent," per Ben Goessling of The Minnesota Star Tribune. </div> <h3 id="-juwan-johnson-te">🟢 Juwan Johnson (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Johnson suited up after dealing with an ankle issue during practice for the second week in a row. The 29-year-old also logged exactly two catches for the second straight contest, as he recorded season lows in targets and receiving yards. The lowlight of Johnson's performance came on his second catch when he coughed up a fumble in the fourth quarter. Johnson went from averaging 9.7 targets per game over the first three weeks to averaging 3.0 over the last three weeks. This downturn in opportunities has coincided with the overall decrease in passing attempts for the Saints across the last three games, so it appears his dropoff in production may continue so long as the New Orleans offense eases its reliance on Spencer Rattler's arm. Johnson will look to grab more passes during the Week 7 contest versus Chicago on Sunday, Sept. 19. </div> <h3 id="-breece-hall-rb">🟢 Breece Hall (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Hall's workload was his largest of the season yet, as the Broncos and Jets engaged in a slugfest where pass protection was at a premium for Justin Fields, who was sacked nine times. Turning to Hall didn't yield particularly encouraging dividends for New York, however, as Denver's talented defense held the running back to a long run of eight yards. Hall had come in on an encouraging two-game stretch where he'd amassed 194 yards on 28 carries against the suspect defenses of the Dolphins and Cowboys, but the notable increase in the caliber of competition Sunday served to neutralize him. Hall and the Jets get an easier assignment in their return stateside, as the Panthers will pay a visit to MetLife Stadium next Sunday for a Week 7 interconference clash. </div> <h3 id="-dallas-goedert-te">🟢 Dallas Goedert (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Goedert led the Eagles across the board in receptions, receiving yards and targets with those marks, and his game-best 36-yard catch also qualified as a season-high figure. The veteran tight end has scored all five of his touchdowns this season over the last four games, and that tally ties a career best for Goedert, who also recorded the same number of trips to the end zone in 2019. With 20 targets in his last two games alone, Goedert will remain a highly viable option in all formats during a Week 7 road matchup against the Vikings on Sunday, Oct. 19. </div> <h3 id="-kendrick-bourne-wr">🟢 Kendrick Bourne (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Fresh off posting a career-best 142 receiving yards against the Rams in Week 5, Bourne likely made his managers double take at the box score after hitting that same mark in consecutive contests. The 29-year-old has shown great chemistry with old teammate Mac Jones, as the former Patriots continue to post video-game numbers filling in for injured 49ers starters in 2025. Bourne continued starting in place of Ricky Pearsall (knee) while Jauan Jennings (ribs) returned in a limited capacity but revealed that he was playing with five broken ribs after the contest. If Pearsall is forced to miss a third consecutive game in Week 7, then Bourne's stock would remain elevated for next Sunday's tilt against the Falcons. </div> <h3 id="-zach-charbonnet-rb">🟢 Zach Charbonnet (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> As made clear by his rushing line, Charbonnet found virtually no running room against a talented Jaguars front seven, and he actually gained 10 fewer rushing yards on two more carries than backfield mate Kenneth Walker. Sunday marked Charbonnet's fourth game with a sub-4.0-yards-per-carry figure this season, so outside of his occasional rushing touchdowns, the third-year back's fantasy outlook remains stagnant heading into a tough Week 7 home matchup against the Texans on Monday night, Oct. 20. </div> <h3 id="-kenneth-walker-iii-rb">🟢 Kenneth Walker III (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Walker logged two fewer carries than Zach Charbonnet, but he outgained his teammate by 10 rushing yards, as neither back was particularly efficient during the defense-centric battle. The fourth-year pro's yardage total represented quite the downturn after he'd topped the 80-yard mark in each of the previous two games, and Charbonnet's workload is somewhat of a concern for the moment for Walker's fantasy managers. It remains to be seen if a similar timeshare will apply moving forward, but neither player has a particularly bright outlook for a Week 7 home matchup against a tough Texans defense on Monday night, Oct. 20. </div> <h3 id="-terry-mclaurin-wr">🟡 Terry McLaurin (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The report is just an estimate after the Commanders held a walk-through. McLaurin is expected to resume practicing in earnest Thursday, although presumably with limitations. Commanders coach Dan Quinn said Wednesday that he isn't sure if McLaurin will be ready for Sunday's game at Dallas. </div> <hr/> <h2 id="-lineup-analysis">📝 Lineup Analysis</h2> <h3 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h3> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_6_2025_BTE_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <h3 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h3> <p><small><em>What you should have started for maximum points</em></small></p> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_6_2025_BTE_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <hr/> <h2 id="-week-7-optimal-projected-lineup">🔮 Week 7 Optimal Projected Lineup</h2> <div style="padding: 15px;

The 23-year-old London didn't cool off over his team's Week 5 bye, bookending the break with a pair of 100-plus yard games with a touchdown scored in each. He actually finished the contest as the only wide receiver to record a catch for Atlanta, highlighting his status as QB Michael Penix's unquestioned No. 1 target. A red-hot London will set his sights on a battered 49ers defense Week 7. </div> <h3 id="-justice-hill-rb">🟢 Justice Hill (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Ravens ran a run-heavy offense as long as possible, giving Hill a chance to mix in on possessions to relieve Derrick Henry. Hill saw a season-high six carries as a result, but he made a more significant impact as a pass catcher. His usage could change with the anticipated return of Lamar Jackson (hamstring) after the team's bye, but Hill has at least three catches in four of six games on the campaign. </div> <h3 id="-joshua-palmer-wr">🟡 Joshua Palmer (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Palmer was forced out of the first half of Monday's 24-14 loss to the Falcons with an ankle injury, finishing the night with two receptions for 60 yards. Though Palmer may have been hard-pressed to make it back to the field if the Bills played on Sunday this week, he'll benefit from Buffalo being on bye for Week 7. The wideout will still need to resume practicing in some fashion during Week 8 to have a chance at playing in the Bills' next game Oct. 26 versus the Panthers. </div> <h3 id="-courtland-sutton-wr">🟢 Courtland Sutton (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Sutton traveled overseas to London for Sunday's international tilt, only to be greeted impolitely by Jets' CB Sauce Gardner once the game kicked off. The shutdown corner won his individual matchup against Sutton, holding Denver's No. 1 wideout to just one reception in the narrow victory. This was Sutton's second one-catch performance through six starts this season, which would be concerning if he hadn't posted WR1 numbers in his four other appearances. Sunday's dud can be written off as a bad matchup coupled with an unfavorable game script. Look for Sutton to get back to his productive ways against the Giants next Sunday. </div> <h3 id="-trevor-lawrence-qb">🟢 Trevor Lawrence (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Lawrence's final passing line with more than adequate, but he also took seven sacks and finished with an ugly 46.6 QBR for the afternoon. The 2021 first overall pick did continue to cultivate his connection with No. 1 receiver Brian Thomas, who he hit on eight occasions for 90 yards, including a 21-yard touchdown late in the first quarter. Lawrence hit Tim Patrick from 26 yards out early in the fourth quarter for his other TD toss, the quarterback's first multi-touchdown-pass tally since Week 2. Despite the solid numbers, the modest point total did Jacksonville in Sunday, a matter he'll look to rectify in a London matchup against the high-powered Rams in Week 7. </div> <h3 id="-hollywood-brown-wr">🟢 Hollywood Brown (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Brown delivered a standout performance under the bright lights of Sunday Night Football when he lifted his team with two trips to the end zone in the second half. The 28-year-old has done an admirable job starting for a thin Chiefs' receiving corps, producing a 30-302-3 line through six weeks of action. The impending doom Brown's managers are currently feeling is the looming return of Kansas City's top WR Rashee Rice. The suspended wideout will return for next Sunday's tilt against the Raiders, potentially eating into his replacement's production in the process. Brown should remain rostered until the dust settles from Rice's return, but expectations should be kept in check for Week 7. </div> <h3 id="-jakobi-meyers-wr">🟡 Jakobi Meyers (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Meyers, who logged 90 percent snap share in a Week 6 win over the Titans, didn't practice Wednesday, but his anticipated presence a day later bodes well for his chances of being available Sunday against the Chiefs. The Raiders' upcoming injury report will clarify the wideout's official participation level Thursday. </div> <h3 id="-rashid-shaheed-wr">🟢 Rashid Shaheed (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The speedy wideout has caught exactly four passes in five straight games, but Sunday's yardage total was his lowest of the season. Shaheed remains dependent on deep throws for significant fantasy value, but with Spencer Rattler getting more confident and comfortable in coach Kellen Moore's offense, connections like last week's 87-yard TD could become more frequent. Shaheed may have a better chance of making an impact in Week 7 against the Bears. </div> <h3 id="-saquon-barkley-rb">🟢 Saquon Barkley (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Barkley was set up well on paper for a matchup against the Giants' porous run defense, but game script would eventually cap his opportunities and lead to his second-lowest carry total of the campaign. He was efficient with his opportunities, averaging an encouraging 4.8 yards per carry after posting 5.0 yards per tote in the Week 5 loss to the Broncos. Barkley has still to crack the 90-yard mark on the ground through six games, however, and he's still averaging just 3.4 yards per carry on the season thanks to a slow start to the season. Barkley will have a tough Week 7 challenge on his hands as well, considering the talented Vikings defense awaits in a Week 7 road matchup on Sunday, Oct. 19. </div> <h3 id="-george-kittle-te">🟢 George Kittle (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Injured Reserve<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Last Wednesday, Shanahan told David Lombardi of SFStandard.com that Kittle as a chance to suit up Week 7, and the tight end's return to practice this Wednesday is the first step in making that a reality. Kittle has been sidelined since the season opener, when he injured his hamstring in the first half of an eventual 49ers win at Seattle. Ultimately, Friday's practice report will reveal his odds to play Sunday versus the Falcons. </div> <h3 id="-brock-purdy-qb">🟡 Brock Purdy (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Purdy has been battling a turf toe injury for most of the season, sitting out Weeks 2 and 3 and 5 and 6 as a result. He was able to log conditioning work on the side last Thursday, and Shanahan told Nick Wagoner of ESPN.com on Monday that Purdy would be evaluated Wednesday to see if taking part in practice was possible. Now that Purdy has resumed on-field work, Shanahan said Purdy is more limited than backup quarterback Mac Jones (knee/oblique), per Matt Barrows of The Athletic. It's unclear if that means Jones is a better bet than Purdy to start Sunday's game against the Falcons, but the latter at least is putting himself in a position to return to action. </div> <h3 id="-tony-pollard-rb">🟢 Tony Pollard (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Pollard finished with his worst fantasy score of the season in a seemingly promising matchup against the Raiders defense. The veteran starter still led Tennessee's backfield with 10 carries, finishing five ahead of backup Tyjae Spears. Pollard's reduced touches were rather the result of a poor game script as opposed to a changing of the guard in Tennessee's backfield. Fantasy managers should continue treating Pollard as a potential flex option against the Patriots next Sunday. </div> <h3 id="-zach-ertz-te">🟢 Zach Ertz (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Following a Week 5 blanking at the hands of the Chargers, Ertz enjoyed a noteworthy resurgence in Monday's narrow loss. The veteran tight end led the Commanders in receptions and targets while checking in behind only Chris Moore in receiving yards. Ertz also posted his first touchdown since Week 2 on a six-yard scoring grab early in the fourth quarter, rounding out an encouraging night that also saw him tie a season high in receptions. He should have a good chance at carrying over his momentum into Week 7, as he'll face the Cowboys' vulnerable defense on the road. </div> <hr/> <h2 id="-lineup-analysis">📝 Lineup Analysis</h2> <h3 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h3> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_6_2025_EET_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <h3 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h3> <p><small><em>What you should have started for maximum points</em></small></p> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_6_2025_EET_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <hr/> <h2 id="-week-7-optimal-projected-lineup">🔮 Week 7 Optimal Projected Lineup</h2> <div style="padding: 15px; background-color: #e7f3ff; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;"> <strong>Next Opponent:</strong> Michael's Managable Team<br/> <strong>Total Projected Points:</strong> 110.66<br/> </div> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_7_2025_EET_projected.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> <th data-field="opponent" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="false">Opponent</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <hr/> <h2 id="-remaining-schedule-analysis">📅 Remaining Schedule Analysis</h2> <div style="padding: 15px; background-color: #fff3cd; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;"> <strong>⚠️ Average Opponent Strength:</strong> 117.94 PPG </div> <table class="table table-sm table-hover"> <thead><tr> <th>Opponent</th><th>Record</th><th>Avg Points</th> </tr></thead> <tbody> <tr><td><strong>Michael's Managable Team</strong></td><td>4-2</td><td>131.77</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>Mama Daughter Duo</strong></td><td>2-4</td><td>134.29</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>Americas Team</strong></td><td>3-3</td><td>131.31</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>Big Titi Energy</strong></td><td>1-5</td><td>91.68</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>To Infinity and Bijan!</strong></td><td>2-4</td><td>109.85</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>Abbey's TNT Team</strong></td><td>4-2</td><td>124.92</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>Mcconky Donkeys</strong></td><td>4-2</td><td>109.85</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>To Infinity and Bijan!</strong></td><td>2-4</td><td>109.85</td></tr> </tbody></table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week6"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">To Infinity and Bijan!

Coach Jonathan Gannon told Tyler Drake of ArizonaSports.com on Wednesday that Murray will need to "make sure he's healthy enough to play. We'll progress him along this week and see where he's at." Murray's activity level Thursday and Friday thus will be key for his chances to return Sunday against the Packers, but if he needs more time to recover, Jacoby Brissett is on hand to lead the Cardinals offense. </div> <h3 id="-darnell-mooney-wr">🟡 Darnell Mooney (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Falcons didn't practice Wednesday, but the listing suggests Mooney will participate later this week. He hasn't practiced since injuring his hamstring during a Week 4 win over Washington. </div> <h3 id="-kyle-pitts-sr-te">🟢 Kyle Pitts Sr. (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Pitts followed up his best performance of the season against the Commanders (5-70-1) with his lowest fantasy score to date on Monday Night Football. Michael Penix was keyed in on Drake London (10-158-1) and Bijan Robinson (6-68-0) in the passing game, leaving scraps for Pitts and the rest of Atlanta's auxiliary options. Pitts still carries a modest 23-223-1 receiving line into a Week 7 road tilt against the 49ers on Sunday. </div> <h3 id="-mark-andrews-te">🟢 Mark Andrews (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The positive for Andrews was that he remained involved in the Baltimore offense, finishing tied for second on the team in targets. He was unable to convert that into much production while catching passes from the combination of Cooper Rush and Tyler Huntley, with his longest gain going for only nine yards. The outlook for all Ravens pass catchers should improve with the anticipated return of Lamar Jackson (hamstring) in Week 8 following the team's bye, though Andrews could lose out on opportunity to more explosive options such as Rashod Bateman and Isaiah Likely. </div> <h3 id="-keon-coleman-wr">🟢 Keon Coleman (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Coleman tied for the team lead in receptions and targets, but as his final line indicates, those opportunities were essentially for naught. The second-year wideout has endured an underwhelming season that's included a Week 5 benching for that game's opening series, and Coleman notably couldn't make an impact Monday despite the Bills being without Dalton Kincaid (oblique) and Curtis Samuel (neck/ribs) to begin the game and then losing Joshua Palmer (ankle) during the contest. Coleman and quarterback Josh Allen will have a Week 7 bye to work on their chemistry before returning to action Oct. 26 on the road against the Panthers. </div> <h3 id="-tetairoa-mcmillan-wr">🟢 Tetairoa McMillan (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> As his final line indicates, the rookie first-round pick made excellent use of his trio of catches, turning two of them into 19- and two-yard touchdown grabs for the first pair of end-zone trips of his career. Otherwise, McMillan's reception, yardage and target totals all tied or served as new season lows, making it a mixed bag of a day to an extent from a fantasy perspective. Nevertheless, McMillan's role as Carolina's No. 1 receiver is as iron clad as it gets, but he's likely to draw plenty of Sauce Gardner's attention in a Week 7 visit to the Jets next Sunday afternoon. </div> <h3 id="-javonte-williams-rb">🟢 Javonte Williams (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Cowboys were forced into a relatively pass-heavy game script as they kept pace with the Panthers. That limited Williams to a season-low 13 carries, but the primary issue was his lack of efficiency. Williams' longest rush went for only six yards, and his longest reception was good for only nine yards. The positive takeaway is that Williams earned 18 touches and the next closest Dallas back (Jaydon Blue) had only three. Williams should have a strong chance to bounce back in Week 7 against Washington. </div> <h3 id="-marvin-mims-jr-wr">🟢 Marvin Mims Jr. (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Mims played 21 of the Broncos' 60 offensive snaps Sunday, behind fellow wide receivers Courtland Sutton (48), Pat Bryant (35) and Troy Franklin (35). The third-year wideout's 35 percent snap share was his lowest mark of the season. Mims has flashed his play-making ability at times this season, but his inconsistent usage in Denver's offense makes him extremely difficult to trust for fantasy purposes. The 23-year-old will have his next chance to take a step forward in a Week 7 matchup against the Giants, yet he'll continue to face stiff competition for targets in a crowded receiving corps. </div> <h3 id="-josh-jacobs-rb">🟡 Josh Jacobs (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> After a somewhat slow start to the season, Jacobs has been making the most of his workload over the last two games, combining for 307 yards from scrimmage and four rushing TDs on 49 touches. As the Packers kick off Week 7 prep, he's dealing with an ailment, but his ability to practice in some capacity Wednesday indicates he isn't in much danger of missing Sunday's contest at Arizona. Jacobs will have two more chances to get back to all activity ahead of the weekend. </div> <h3 id="-quentin-johnston-wr">🟡 Quentin Johnston (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Johnston approached Week 6 action with a questionable tag after logging limited practices Wednesday through Friday, and he was ultimately deemed inactive for the Chargers' 29-27 win over the Dolphins. Johnston now has two more chances to upgrade his participation level ahead of this Sunday's game against the Colts, but the wideout will likely need to practice fully by Friday in order to avoid a Week 7 injury designation. </div> <h3 id="-carson-wentz-qb">🟢 Carson Wentz (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Wentz emerged from the Vikings' last game Week 5 against the Browns in London with an injury to his left, non-throwing shoulder. Coach Kevin O'Connell said Wednesday that Wentz handled every throw at Monday's unofficial session, and the veteran signal-caller seemingly maintained that activity level two days later. Per Alec Lewis of The Athletic, O'Connell also wouldn't name a starter for Week 7 between Wentz and second-year pro J.J. McCarthy, who was limited Wednesday in his first practice since he suffered a high right-ankle sprain Week 2. How McCarthy fares as the week continues likely will determine who is under center for Minnesota on Sunday versus the Eagles. </div> <h3 id="-justin-jefferson-wr">🟢 Justin Jefferson (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Jefferson paced the Vikings in receptions, receiving yards and targets on the day, turning in his second consecutive 100-yard effort in the process. His final reception of the contest was especially critical, as he came down with a 21-yard grab to take the ball to the Browns' 27 yard-line with under two minutes remaining on Minnesota's game-winning drive. Jefferson has displayed excellent chemistry with fill-in signal-caller Carson Wentz over the last pair of contests, but J.J. McCarthy (ankle) may be set to return to action when the Vikings come out of a Week 6 bye to host the Eagles on Sunday, Oct. 19. </div> <h3 id="-justin-fields-qb">🟢 Justin Fields (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Fields has yet to throw an interception this season, but his cautious approach hasn't led to any success, as the Jets are the last remaining winless team in the NFL. After mustering only 45 passing yards in the team's Week 6 loss to the Broncos, Fields is looking to take more chances moving forward, which may be required to prevent getting benched in favor of Tyrod Taylor. Bouncing back as a passer won't be easy for Fields on Sunday against the Panthers without Wilson, who has the league's second-highest target share this season. </div> <h3 id="-chris-godwin-jr-wr">🔴 Chris Godwin Jr. (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Doubtful<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Though the Buccaneers have yet to officially rule Godwin out for this coming Monday's game against the Lions, head coach Todd Bowles acknowledged earlier in the week that the veteran wideout is likely on track to miss a second straight contest due to a fibula injury. Godwin's absence from the team's first Week 7 practice supports that notion, and he could be one of three key playmakers that the Buccaneers will be without in a matchup with Detroit. In addition to Godwin, receiver Emeka Egbuka (hamstring) and running back Bucky Irving (shoulder/foot) were spectators for Thursday's practice, though wideout Mike Evans (hamstring) returned to the field for the first time since Week 3. </div> <hr/> <h2 id="-lineup-analysis">📝 Lineup Analysis</h2> <h3 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h3> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_6_2025_TIB_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <h3 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h3> <p><small><em>What you should have started for maximum points</em></small></p> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_6_2025_TIB_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <hr/> <h2 id="-week-7-optimal-projected-lineup">🔮 Week 7 Optimal Projected Lineup</h2> <div style="padding: 15px;

Positively, he did continue to show a connection with fellow rookie tight end Harold Fannin, as the duo connected for a 25-yard gain -- the longest of the day for both Gabriel and the team. Gabriel should have the chance to put together a better performance in Week 7 when the Browns host the Dolphins. </div> <h3 id="-quinshon-judkins-rb">🟢 Quinshon Judkins (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Browns fell behind early in the game and took to the air 52 times in a comeback effort. That limited Judkins' opportunity, and he also lost out on touches to Jerome Ford as a pass catcher. Judkins also suffered from an efficiency perspective, with his longest gain of the day going for only six yards. The Browns should be in a more neutral game script in Week 7 against Miami, so Judkins is likely to be in for a bounce-back performance. </div> <h3 id="-jameson-williams-wr">🟢 Jameson Williams (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Williams finally put together a strong showing, leading the Lions in receiving yards while finding the end zone for the first time since Week 2. His touchdown catch was his longest of the day, as he caught a pass deep across the middle of the field before crashing through several defenders for a 22-yard score. Williams also tallied a pair of 15-yard gains to help him surpass 50 receiving yards in a game for only the second time this season. </div> <h3 id="-jonathan-taylor-rb">🟢 Jonathan Taylor (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Taylor put together another signature stat line, averaging 5.9 yards per carry on his way to his second-highest rushing yardage total of the season. He also scored his fourth touchdown of the last two games on a one-yard rush with under five minutes remaining to erase a 27-24 deficit and put the final points of the day up on the board. Taylor is already sitting on 603 rushing yards, seven rush TDs and an average of 5.3 yards per carry through six contests, and he'll face the Chargers' porous run defense in a Week 7 road showdown next Sunday. </div> <h3 id="-brock-bowers-te">🟡 Brock Bowers (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Bowers is standing on the sideline in shorts, which comes as no surprise after reports this past weekend suggested he's unlikely to return for Week 7 at Kansas City. He initially suffered a PCL injury and bone bruise in Week 1, and it now seems the goal may be a return after the Raiders' Week 8 bye. TE Michael Mayer filled in admirably during Sunday's 20-10 win over Tennessee, catching five passes for 50 yards and a touchdown on a team-high seven targets (while playing 91 percent of snaps on offense). </div> <h3 id="-kimani-vidal-rb">🟢 Kimani Vidal (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Despite reports earlier this week Vidal and Hassan Haskins would be a part of a committee, the second-year back proved definitively he was the more explosive player by tallying 138 total yards on 21 touches to Haskins' 23 yards on seven opportunities. Omarion Hampton (ankle) is expected to be out at least a month, and while the Chargers have reportedly been sniffing around available options according to NFL.com's Ian Rapoport, Vidal's massive outing might quiet the trade calls for another week. It's worth noting Miami's run defense is one of the worst in the league, and it should be tougher sledding at home against the Colts next week. </div> <h3 id="-tua-tagovailoa-qb">🟢 Tua Tagovailoa (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Tagovailoa's turnover issues persisted in the narrow loss, although the last of his three interceptions came on a last-gasp play to close out the contest. The 2020 first-round pick's first two INTs were much more ill-timed, as Tagovailoa short-circuited drives at the Chargers' 39-yard line and his own 37, which led to 10 points for Los Angeles. Tagovailoa did lead Miami to two fourth-quarter touchdown drives and capped the second one off with a seven-yard scoring toss to Darren Waller with 46 seconds remaining, but he also undeniably played a direct part in the Dolphins falling to 1-5. Tagovailoa's Week 7 matchup is far from ideal in terms of his quest to atone for the turnover-filled performance, as a road trip to Cleveland to face the Browns' aggressive defense awaits. </div> <h3 id="-jaylen-waddle-wr">🟢 Jaylen Waddle (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Waddle fell just short of his second consecutive 100-yard effort, but he still led the Dolphins in receptions, receiving yards and targets on the afternoon. The 2021 first-round pick has unsurprisingly seen an uptick in involvement during the first two full games Miami has played without Tyreek Hill (IR, knee), posting a combined 12-205-1 receiving line on 17 targets in that pair of contests. Waddle's clear-cut No. 1 receiver role should persist in a Week 7 road matchup against a talented Browns defense. </div> <h3 id="-jordan-addison-wr">🟢 Jordan Addison (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Kevin Seifert of ESPN.com reported Addison was subject to a first-quarter benching for undisclosed reasons, but the third-year wideout ultimately would make up for lost time in clutch fashion. Addison was efficient with his opportunities, and the bulk of those came at the tail end of the Vikings' game-winning drive late in the fourth quarter. Addison was on the receiving end of each of Carson Wentz's final three completions and totaled 21 yards on those catches, the last which was a go-ahead 12-yard touchdown grab. For his part, Addison conceded afterward that he wasn't sure if he'd even be able to play in the game, per Seifert, but he made good on his vow to be ready if he did step on the field. Following the completion of his season-opening three-game suspension, Addison has immediately played a key part in Minnesota's air attack with a 9-155-1 line on 14 targets over his first two contests. He'll now prepare to play his first 2025 game stateside following the Week 6 bye when the Vikings host the Eagles on Sunday, Oct. 19 in a contest that could also provide Addison his first regular-season opportunity to work with J.J. McCarthy (ankle) as his quarterback. </div> <h3 id="-jordan-mason-rb">🟢 Jordan Mason (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Mason's rushing opportunities were limited, but he locked in a solid fantasy day with a three-yard touchdown run to cap off the first drive of the second half. The offseason addition generally found tough sledding on the ground outside of the short score and his game-long 14-yard run, but he continued to keep Minnesota's ground attack viable in the ongoing absence of Aaron Jones (IR, hamstring). Mason should be in line to remain the lead back when the Vikings come out of the Week 6 bye with a Week 7 home matchup against the Eagles on Sunday, Oct. 19. </div> <h3 id="-garrett-wilson-wr">🔴 Garrett Wilson (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Doubtful<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Wilson also logged a 'DNP' on Wednesday, and though coach Aaron Glenn hasn't ruled out the wideout for Sunday's game against the Panthers, ESPN's Adam Schefter previously reported that Wilson is expected to miss a couple of weeks after hyperextending his knee in Week 6. While Wilson is trending in the wrong direction ahead of the weekend, fellow WR Josh Reynolds (hip) participated in practice Thursday after missing Wednesday's session. </div> <h3 id="-jaylen-warren-rb">🟢 Jaylen Warren (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Warren returned from a one-game absence caused by a knee injury with his role in question due to competition from Kenneth Gainwell. Warren comfortably led the team with 11 carries, though he gave up a considerable amount of work to Gainwell in the receiving game. He was efficient with his work, but Warren appears to be the leader of a committee in Pittsburgh rather than a true lead back for the time being. </div> <h3 id="-jauan-jennings-wr">🟡 Jauan Jennings (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Jennings played through five broken ribs, among other health concerns, during the 49ers' loss to Tampa Bay in Week 6, a contest in which he handled 77 percent of offensive snaps but secured just one of three targets for seven yards. While Jennings may again manage to play through his injuries at home against the Falcons on Sunday, he's combined for just three grabs for 31 yards (on seven targets) in his last two appearances. Meanwhile, Ricky Pearsall (knee) and Skyy Moore (undisclosed) are not practicing Wednesday. </div> <h3 id="-aj-barner-te">🟢 AJ Barner (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Barner finished in the relatively unfamiliar position of second in receiving yardage and tied with Jaxon Smith-Njigba for the longest reception of the game. That catch covered a distance of 61 yards on the first play of Seattle's game-clinching drive, with Barner getting loose down the middle of the field after making the reception and taking the ball down to the Jaguars' 12-yard line. Barner has now set new single-game season highs in receiving yards in three consecutive contests, but he's typically much more of a shorter-area target for Sam Darnold and will remain a complementary pass-catching option in a tough Week 7 home matchup against the Texans on Monday night, Oct. 20. </div> <h3 id="-tyjae-spears-rb">🟢 Tyjae Spears (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Spears more than doubled his total touches in his second game back from an ankle injury. Tony Pollard (10-34-0) still spearheaded the Titans' backfield, but the gap in touch distribution inched even closer Sunday. The speedy backup will continue vying for more snaps against the Patriots next Sunday. </div> <hr/> <h2 id="-lineup-analysis">📝 Lineup Analysis</h2> <h3 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h3> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_6_2025_90s_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <h3 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h3> <p><small><em>What you should have started for maximum points</em></small></p> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_6_2025_90s_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <hr/> <h2 id="-week-7-optimal-projected-lineup">🔮 Week 7 Optimal Projected Lineup</h2> <div style="padding: 15px;

In the end, Michael Carter (11 touches for 64 yards and no touchdowns on a 44 percent snap share) and Bam Knight (12-54-1 on 51 percent) split the backfield almost evenly Week 6. However, Knight was limited Wednesday due to a knee issue, leaving Carter as the sole healthy running back on Arizona's active roster. </div> <h3 id="-michael-penix-jr-qb">🟢 Michael Penix Jr. (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Penix outdueled Bills star QB Josh Allen (57.7 completion percentage for 180 yards) on the national stage en route to the Falcons' third win of the campaign. Bijan Robinson stole the show on offense with 238 yards from scrimmage, but Atlanta's signal-caller also deserves praise for the upset victory. Penix led an impressive 14-play drive midway through the fourth quarter that ate up most of the remaining clock while deflating Buffalo's hopes of a comeback. The surging sophomore will look to build on a modest two-game win streak when the Falcons take on the 49ers in Week 7. </div> <h3 id="-travis-kelce-te">🟢 Travis Kelce (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Kelce kept the good times rolling with another positive fantasy result following last week's 7-61-1 receiving line. The 35-year-old hasn't posted eye-popping numbers in any particular week, but the consistent production at a shallow position certainly makes fantasy managers' lives easier when constructing weekly lineups. Kelce will continue operating as one of Patrick Mahomes' top and most-trusted targets against the Raiders next Sunday. </div> <h3 id="-hunter-henry-te">🟢 Hunter Henry (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Through six games, Henry has maintained steady playing time while recording a 20-277-3 receiving line on 31 targets. Though his volume has tapered off over his last three outings, the tight end remains a viable red-zone option for QB Drake Maye and a candidate to see increased targets on any given week, when game script and/or game flow dictate. </div> <h3 id="-chris-olave-wr">🟡 Chris Olave (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> It's the first report this season of any limitations in practice, likely reflecting a new injury suffered during Sunday's 25-19 loss to the Patriots. Olave's practice participation at the start of Week 7, even in a limited capacity, suggests he's on track to play this Sunday against the Bears. He's accounted for a whopping 32.2 percent of New Orleans' targets this season, but with meager averages of 8.8 yards per catch and 5.3 yards per target. Olave did finally hit on a big play this past Sunday, catching a deep pass for 53 yards on the first snap of the game against New England. </div> <h3 id="-will-shipley-rb">🟢 Will Shipley (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Shipley hasn't been a significant part of the offense at any point this season for the Eagles, but Thursday represented his season-low snap count. He did not touch the ball on offense but did return one kick for 22 yards. </div> <h3 id="-devonta-smith-wr">🟢 DeVonta Smith (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Smith was third across the board to Dallas Goedert and A.J. Brown in receptions, receiving yards and targets on the night, and his overall numbers represented a significant downturn from his season-best effort against the Broncos on Sunday. Smith recorded exactly half of the receptions and targets he had in that contest, while his yardage tally was a sharp decline from the 114 he managed versus Denver. His first opportunity to bounce back will come against the Vikings in a Week 7 road matchup on Sunday, Oct. 19. </div> <h3 id="-jalen-hurts-qb">🟢 Jalen Hurts (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Hurts and the Eagles offense had a productive first quarter when they netted 10 points as a unit, and the reigning Super Bowl MVP connected with Dallas Goedert from three yards out late in the period for six of those. Hurts would add a one-yard touchdown run at just under the seven-minute mark of the second quarter, and that would surprisingly be the end of the scoring on the night for Philadelphia. Hurts exceeded 30 pass attempts for a second consecutive contest for the first time this season, and he averaged a season-best 8.6 yards per attempt Thursday while connecting with six different targets. The sixth-year pro's one interception also was very costly, however, as it came at the Giants' nine-yard line early in the fourth quarter with the Eagles down 10 and was returned all the way to Philadelphia's 23-yard line to set up the New York's game-clinching touchdown. Hurts has hit or exceeded 280 passing yards in each of the last two games heading into a Week 7 road showdown against the Vikings on Sunday, Oct. 19. </div> <h3 id="-kaleb-johnson-rb">🟢 Kaleb Johnson (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Johnson saw six carries during the Steelers' Week 4 win over the Vikings, and he saw a similar workload following Pittsburgh's Week 5 bye. Jaylen Warren continues to serve as the team's clear lead back, but Johnson has seen slightly more opportunities over the past two games. The 22-year-old's 11 offensive snaps still lagged behind Warren (31) and Kenneth Gainwell (20), and Johnson's fantasy value will likely remain limited as long as those two remain healthy. </div> <h3 id="-dk-metcalf-wr">🟢 DK Metcalf (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Metcalf remained Aaron Rodgers' top target, leading the team in targets and yards. All four of his catches went for 20 yards or more, highlighted by a 25-yard score down the right sideline to kick off the fourth quarter. Even with an additional missed opportunity for a long touchdown due to an underthrow by Rodgers, Metcalf has found the end zone in each of his last four games and has topped 80 receiving yards in three of five contests to begin his tenure with the Steelers. </div> <h3 id="-christian-mccaffrey-rb">🟢 Christian McCaffrey (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> McCaffrey scored his first regular-season touchdown since the 2023 campaign after being held out of the end zone as a runner over his previous five starts this year and all four healthy appearances in 2024. The dual-threat superstar has been in the doldrums as a pure rusher this season (3.1 YPC), but he has offset that with WR1 production as a receiver (46-444-3). In fact, CMC has finished with more receiving yards than rushing yards in five of his six starts this year, highlighting a peculiar start to his game logs. Fantasy managers could care less how their workhorse gets his numbers so long as the overall production is elite, as it has been all season. McCaffrey will likely be asked to continue shouldering the load for the 49ers' offense against the Falcons on Sunday Night Football in Week 7. </div> <h3 id="-rachaad-white-rb">🟢 Rachaad White (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> White got the nod in place of injured starter Bucky Irving (foot/shoulder) for the second consecutive week, rewarding fantasy managers with his third touchdown over that span. The 26-year-old White finished below four yards per carry in both spot-starts, but his nose for the goal line helped cement another strong fantasy score. No. 3 RB Sean Tucker (6-25-1) remained a distant second in carries behind White, but the former was able to vulture a touchdown from the fill-in starter this time around. The Buccaneers have an extra day off before hosting the Lions on Monday Night Football in Week 7, so White's managers should monitor Irving's availability leading up to that contest before deciding whether to deploy White in their lineups. </div> <hr/> <h2 id="-lineup-analysis">📝 Lineup Analysis</h2> <h3 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h3> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_6_2025_JST_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <h3 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h3> <p><small><em>What you should have started for maximum points</em></small></p> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_6_2025_JST_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <hr/> <h2 id="-week-7-optimal-projected-lineup">🔮 Week 7 Optimal Projected Lineup</h2> <div style="padding: 15px;

</code></pre> <hr/> <h2 id="-player-report">🏥 Player Report</h2> <h3 id="-marvin-harrison-jr-wr">🟡 Marvin Harrison Jr. (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Harrison was diagnosed with a concussion during this past Sunday's loss at Indianapolis, and while Jonathan Gannon told Dani Sureck of the team's official site on Wednesday that the second-year wide receiver remains in the protocol for head injuries, his limited listing indicates he at least has made some progress through it. In order to play Sunday against the Packers, though, Harrison will need to gain clearance from an independent neurologist. Arizona's receiving corps is particularly banged up at the moment, as Michael Wilson (foot, limited) and Zay Jones (knee, DNP) also are tending to injuries. </div> <h3 id="-james-cook-iii-rb">🟢 James Cook III (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Cook enjoyed a solid night on the ground despite game script working against the run as the game unfolded, bouncing back nicely from a 49-yard showing in the Week 5 loss to the Patriots. However, he failed to draw a target for the first time this season after not hauling in the one pass thrown his way Week 5, a relatively rare slump for him as a pass catcher. Cook's fantasy value remains significantly elevated in all formats, however, and he draws a favorable matchup on the road against the Panthers on Sunday, Oct. 26 following Buffalo's Week 7 bye. </div> <h3 id="-jk-dobbins-rb">🟢 J.K. Dobbins (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Denver's entire backfield struggled to find running lanes Sunday, with no tailbacks finishing with a per-carry average higher than 3.0 yards in the win. Dobbins still comfortably led the Broncos with 14 rushing attempts, 12 more than rookie backup RJ Harvey. This was easily Dobbins' worst fantasy score of the season after providing managers with five weeks of consistent RB2 production. The veteran starter has an excellent opportunity to get back on track in Week 7 against the Giants, who currently are surrendering 128.8 rushing yards per game thus far this season. </div> <h3 id="-romeo-doubs-wr">🟢 Romeo Doubs (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Doubs was Jordan Love's top target in Sunday's win, leading the team in targets. He converted that into his third performance of 50 or more receiving yards this season, thanks to long gains of 21 and 15 yards. Doubs isn't likely to turn in huge fantasy performances often thanks to the emergence of Matthew Golden and Tucker Kraft, but it's clear he has rapport and the trust of Love, which should be enough to keep Doubs involved in the offense. </div> <h3 id="-matthew-golden-wr">🟢 Matthew Golden (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Golden continues to get more involved in the Green Bay offense, as he's now earned at least five targets in each of his last three games. He was impressive with the opportunity, ripping off long gains of 35 and 31 yards, the latter of which all but clinched a win for the Packers. Golden topped 100 yards from scrimmage for the first time in his career while showcasing his ability to work deep down the field and also pick up yards after the catch. He appears to be earning trust from coaches and Jordan Love, which should lead to more consistent usage as the season progresses. </div> <h3 id="-tyler-warren-te">🟢 Tyler Warren (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Warren tied Josh Downs for the team lead in receptions and led the way in both receiving yards and targets on an afternoon where he also recorded his second touchdown grab of the season. Warren found the end zone from eight yards out to cap off the opening possession of the game, and he tallied his fifth catch of 20-plus yards this season earlier in the drive with a 23-yard reception. The rookie tight end will continue to serve as a focal point of the offense during a Week 7 marquee road matchup against the Chargers. </div> <h3 id="-travis-hunter-wr">🟢 Travis Hunter (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Hunter had career highs for snap share (79 percent) and route share (88 percent) in Sunday's loss to Seattle, but his seven targets largely came near the line of scrimmage (4.0 aDOT) and led to a meager 4-15-0 receiving line. He's already getting a few schemed touches each week yet has a much lower per-route target rate (19 percent) than teammates Brian Thomas (24 percent), Parker Washington (25 percent), Travis Etienne (23 percent) and Bhayshul Tuten (29 percent). The Jaguars could look to get Hunter more deep/intermediate targets, but that won't necessarily be easy to do against a tough Rams defense this Sunday in London. </div> <h3 id="-ashton-jeanty-rb">🟢 Ashton Jeanty (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Jeanty ground out a solid fantasy day by scoring his third rushing touchdown of the year on a season-high 23 carries. Veteran backup Raheem Mostert (five carries) was the only other rusher to record a touch in the win, highlighting Jeanty's stranglehold on the every-down role out of Las Vegas' backfield. The sixth overall pick from this year's draft has generated 497 combined yards from scrimmage with five total touchdowns through six starts in 2025. Jeanty's offensive involvement has increased with an average of 22.3 touches over the Raiders' last three contests. Fantasy managers can start the Boise State product with confidence for next Sunday's road tilt against the Chiefs. </div> <h3 id="-omarion-hampton-rb">🟢 Omarion Hampton (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Injured Reserve<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Chargers head coach Jim Harbaugh didn't provide many details about the injury Hampton sustained in the Week 5 loss to the Commanders, but the fact that the promising rookie is expected to need more than four weeks to make a full recovery points to him likely nursing a high-ankle sprain. A target date for Hampton's return has yet to be established, but because the Chargers have a bye coming up in Week 12, the team could be motivated to hold him out through that period to give him ample time to heal. Garafolo notes that Hassan Haskins is likely to serve as the Chargers' lead back Sunday in Miami while practice-squad signee Kimani Vidal also sees work, but Los Angeles is also expected to be in the market for a running back ahead of the Nov. 4 trade deadline to compensate for the long-term injuries to Hampton and Najee Harris (Achilles). </div> <h3 id="-ollie-gordon-ii-rb">🟢 Ollie Gordon II (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Gordon once again struggled to display efficiency while operating as the Dolphins' top reserve backfield option, while starter De'Von Achane gashed Los Angeles with 16 carries for 128 rushing yards (8.0 YPC) and two scores, adding four grabs for 22 yards in the receiving game (six targets). At this stage, Gordon retains fantasy value purely as a handcuff in deeper formats, as his availability has rendered Jaylen Wright a healthy scratch. The rookie sixth-round pick faces a rough matchup on the road against Cleveland in Week 7. </div> <h3 id="-kayshon-boutte-wr">🟢 Kayshon Boutte (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> While his target volume was modest, it was Boutte's biggest share since Week 1, and he led the Patriots in receptions and receiving yards Sunday while hauling in scores of 25 and 29 yards from Drake Maye in the first half. Boutte will take an 18-301-3 line on 23 targets this season into a Week 7 clash with the Titans, and with Maye seemingly headed for a breakout campaign, the third-year wideout's fantasy value may be on the upswing. </div> <h3 id="-mac-jones-qb">🟡 Mac Jones (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Jones will be joined on the practice field by No. 1 QB Brock Purdy (toe), though the latter will be more limited than the former, according to what Shanahan told Matt Barrows of The Athletic. It's unknown if that means Jones has better odds than Purdy to continue leading the 49ers offense Week 7, but Purdy at least has put himself in a position to see his first game action since Week 4. In four starts in place of Purdy this season, Jones has completed 113 of 168 passes (67.3 percent) for 1,252 yards, six touchdowns and three interceptions, rushed 16 times for 23 yards and fumbled three times (one lost). </div> <h3 id="-jake-tonges-te">🟢 Jake Tonges (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Tonges continued doing his best George Kittle (hamstring) impression in another effective spot-start Sunday. The 25-year-old Tonges has been a pleasant surprise in fantasy during his brief run as the starter, posting a 25-223-3 receiving line through six games. David Lombardi of SFStandard.com reported that Kittle could return from injured reserve in Week 7, which would effectively end Tonges' run of utility. Managers should wait until Kittle is officially activated before making any rash decisions regarding Tonges in Week 7 and onward. </div> <h3 id="-chig-okonkwo-te">🟢 Chig Okonkwo (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Okonkwo's six targets Sunday tied his previous season high, while the six grabs set a new high-water mark through six starts. Aside from a one-catch dud in Week 4, the veteran tight end has carved out a consistent role in the passing game.

</code></pre> <hr/> <h2 id="-player-report">🏥 Player Report</h2> <h3 id="-tyler-allgeier-rb">🟢 Tyler Allgeier (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Allgeier got involved in the box score early with a 21-yard touchdown scamper on Atlanta's opening possession. The talented backup then took a back seat to starter Bijan Robinson, who ripped apart Buffalo's defense to the tune of 238 yards and a score of his own. Allgeier has generated some flex appeal after hitting pay dirt thrice over his last four appearances. There is a four-yard dud nestled in between, so fantasy managers should also be aware of Allgeier's drastic floor ahead of Sunday's tilt against San Francisco. </div> <h3 id="-david-njoku-te">🟡 David Njoku (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Njoku appears to be missing a second consecutive practice due to the knee injury he suffered during Cleveland's loss to the Steelers in Week 6, which bodes poorly for his odds of being able to suit up at home against the Dolphins on Sunday even though the issue isn't considered long-term. Zac Jackson of The Athletic reports that Njoku is one of Cleveland's top candidates to be moved ahead of the Nov. 4 trade deadline, which could motivate the team to be extra cautious with the tight end's health. If Njoku indeed can't go Week 7, rookie third-round pick Harold Fannin will benefit from increased target opportunities at the tight end position. </div> <h3 id="-troy-franklin-wr">🟢 Troy Franklin (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Franklin's day in London got off to a rubbish start when he coughed up the first fumble of his career on his first reception of the contest. The silver lining for fantasy managers was that the wideout remained involved offensively following the turnover, receiving three more touches in the narrow win. Franklin has shown flashes of upside early in his sophomore campaign, but Sunday's dud is an example of the inconsistency he can exhibit. The 22-year-old's value is likely limited to deeper formats in next Sunday's tilt against the Giants. </div> <h3 id="-evan-engram-te">🟢 Evan Engram (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Engram led Denver in targets, receptions and yardage in an odd victory that saw No. 1 WR Courtland Sutton finish with just one reception. The 30-year-old Engram also recorded his first rushing attempt of the season, something we haven't seen consistently from the tight end since his early years as a member of the New York Giants. Sunday's solid showing overseas comes on the heels of the veteran tight end's first touchdown of the year against the Eagles last week. Managers in need of help at the tight-end position should take a serious look at the ascending Engram in Week 7 when the Broncos host the aforementioned Giants next Sunday. </div> <h3 id="-joe-mixon-rb">🟢 Joe Mixon (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Out<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Caserio's comments during his press conference mark the first time that a member of the Houston brass has addressed Mixon's status since the start of the regular season. The veteran running back was placed on the non-football injury list ahead of training camp after getting hurt during an individual workout in the spring, and the Texans have been non-committal on a timeline for his return ever since. Given that the Texans aren't yet hinting that Mixon will even resume practicing in the near future, the 29-year-old doesn't look like he's on track to be an option in the Houston backfield until late in the season, if at all. The Texans are likely to continue to lean on a timeshare of Nick Chubb and rookie Woody Marks at running back for the foreseeable future. </div> <h3 id="-brian-thomas-jr-wr">🟢 Brian Thomas Jr. (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Thomas led the Jaguars' pass catchers across the board in receptions, receiving yards and targets, one-upping the then season-best 80-yard effort he'd posted against the Chiefs on Monday night. The second-year wideout also scored his long-awaited first touchdown of the campaign via a 21-yard grab late in the first quarter that opened the scoring on the afternoon. Thomas has started to find some equilibrium in his production over the last three games, and he'll aim to extend the momentum in a Week 7 matchup against the Rams in London. </div> <h3 id="-rashee-rice-wr">🟢 Rashee Rice (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Reid declined to discuss expectations for playing time, saying he isn't sure how many snaps Rice will take. Reid did say that the wideout is in good shape, and ESPN's Jeremy Fowler reports that the Chiefs won't ease Rice back into action. Rice's impressive production to this point in his career means most fantasy managers will want him in lineups, even if there are minor workload concerns for his first game in more than a year. He's coming back from a six-game suspension after completing his rehab from an LCL tear during the offseason. Rice also dealt with a groin injury during the preseason, but there's been no hint of any trouble there since August. He's been allowed at team facilities since Week 4, giving the Chiefs plenty of time to evaluate his conditioning and get him up to speed schematically. </div> <h3 id="-isiah-pacheco-rb">🟢 Isiah Pacheco (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Pacheco finished Sunday's win as the Chiefs' leading rusher, garnering six more touches than veteran backup Kareem Hunt (6-23-0). The 26-year-old Pacheco had been mired in an even timeshare for most of the season, so Sunday's disparity in touches could be something to monitor moving forward. Pacheco would need that hypothetical increase in usage in order to develop into a reliable starting option in fantasy. Until then, treat the physical runner as nothing more than a flex option against the Raiders next Sunday. </div> <h3 id="-ladd-mcconkey-wr">🟢 Ladd McConkey (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> McConkey's 42-yard reception on the final possession with under a minute to go was the catalyst for the game-winning field goal just three plays later, but the second-year wideout benefitted significantly in the absence of Quentin Johnston (hamstring) by leading the team in receiving yards, targets and receptions for the first time this season. This kind of workload could be the status quo for the foreseeable future as Los Angeles struggles to deal with a litany of injuries, whether to rookie running back Omarion Hampton (ankle), Johnston or a bevy of injured offensive lineman. </div> <h3 id="-devon-achane-rb">🟢 De’Von Achane (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Achane had been uncharacteristically bottled up by the Panthers in Week 5, but the electric back set an early tone Sunday with a 49-yard breakaway touchdown run with just over four minutes remaining in the first quarter. He'd go on to add a four-yard scoring scamper with just under eight minutes left in the contest, a score that narrowed a 26-13 deficit. Achane eclipsed the century mark for the first time this season with Sunday's production, and his carry total was his second highest through the first six contests. The third-year back should play a key role again during a Week 7 road clash against the tough Browns defense. </div> <h3 id="-darius-slayton-wr">🟡 Darius Slayton (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Slayton injured his hamstring during the Giants' Week 5 loss at New Orleans and hasn't practiced in the meantime, sitting out last Thursday's win against the Eagles in the process. He'll have two more chances this week to mix into drills before New York potentially makes a ruling on his status for Sunday's game at Denver. </div> <h3 id="-aaron-rodgers-qb">🟢 Aaron Rodgers (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Rodgers had one of his better showings of the season, completing five passes of at least 20 yards. Four of those went to DK Metcalf, including a 25-yard touchdown down the right sideline to begin the fourth quarter. Rodgers has had a mixed start to his tenure with the Steelers, though he's averaged over 7.5 yards per attempt in three of five games this season, with Sunday also marking his third multi-touchdown performance of the campaign. </div> <h3 id="-mike-evans-wr">🟡 Mike Evans (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Bowles said Tampa Bay will continue to monitor Evans throughout the week before making a decision on his availability, or lack thereof, for Monday Night Football against Detroit. If Evans is able to get back on the field Week 7 after having missed the Buccaneers' last three games it will provide a tremendous boost for Baker Mayfield and the passing attack, especially given that both Emeke Egbuka (hamstring) and Chris Godwin (fibula) could be unavailable. The extent of Evans' practice activity Friday and Saturday figure to be crucial, and it won't be surprising if the final word on his status comes down to the wire. </div> <h3 id="-baker-mayfield-qb">🟢 Baker Mayfield (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Mayfield produced a sterling 139.0 passer rating against a 49ers defense that was helpless after losing LB Fred Warner (ankle) early in the contest. The Buccaneers also suffered a key loss early on when WR Emeka Egbuka (hamstring) exited the game after recording just two receptions. This meant that Mayfield had to finish off the win sans his three top weapons, with Mike Evans (hamstring) and Chris Godwin (fibula) in street clothes Sunday. The 30-year-old Mayfield overcame expectations and produced his fifth multi-score game through six starts. With the Buccaneers visiting the Lions on Monday Night Football in Week 7, it will be important for fantasy managers to note which receivers Mayfield will have at his disposal before making roster decisions. </div> <h3 id="-tyler-lockett-wr">🟢 Tyler Lockett (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Lockett's snap rate remained depressed for the second straight game, as he was on the field for only 32 percent of offensive snaps. He was still targeted three times, though his lone catch went for no gain. Lockett has posted at least 10 receiving yards in a game only once this season. </div> <h3 id="-jayden-daniels-qb">🟢 Jayden Daniels (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br/> <strong>Details:</strong> As his collection of numbers indicates, it was a mixed bag of a night for Daniels in his second game back from a knee sprain that cost him a pair of contests. The second-year signal-caller threw a season-high three touchdown passes, connecting with Chris Moore (22 yards), Luke McCaffrey (33 yards) and Zach Ertz (six yards) to erase 13-0 and 16-10 deficits. However, Daniels' first-quarter interception, his first of the season, led to a Bears field goal, and his fumble at Chicago's 45-yard line on an attempted handoff to Jacory Croskey-Merritt with 3:10 remaining and Washington clinging to a two-point lead would eventually result in a game-winning field goal by opposing kicker Jake Moody. Daniels also took three sacks, and this was his first multi-turnover tally of the season. The star quarterback and his teammates don't have time to dwell on the last-second defeat, however, as a road date with the arch-rival Cowboys awaits Sunday afternoon. </div> <hr/> <h2 id="-lineup-analysis">📝 Lineup Analysis</h2> <h3 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h3> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_6_2025_KTT_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <h3 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h3> <p><small><em>What you should have started for maximum points</em></small></p> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_6_2025_KTT_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/></p> <hr/> <h2 id="-week-7-optimal-projected-lineup">🔮 Week 7 Optimal Projected Lineup</h2> <div style="padding: 15px; background-color: #e7f3ff; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;"> <strong>Next Opponent:</strong> Abbey's TNT Team<br/> <strong>Total Projected Points:</strong> 137.45<br/> </div> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_7_2025_KTT_projected.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> <th data-field="opponent" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="false">Opponent</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <hr/> <h2 id="-remaining-schedule-analysis">📅 Remaining Schedule Analysis</h2> <div style="padding: 15px; background-color: #fff3cd; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;"> <strong>🔥 Average Opponent Strength:</strong> 121.13 PPG </div> <table class="table table-sm table-hover"> <thead><tr> <th>Opponent</th><th>Record</th><th>Avg Points</th> </tr></thead> <tbody> <tr><td><strong>Abbey's TNT Team</strong></td><td>4-2</td><td>124.92</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>Game of Zones - House Hamlin</strong></td><td>4-2</td><td>128.40</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>Rookie Mistake</strong></td><td>3-3</td><td>119.25</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>Michael's Managable Team</strong></td><td>4-2</td><td>131.77</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>Americas Team</strong></td><td>3-3</td><td>131.31</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>To Infinity and Bijan!</strong></td><td>2-4</td><td>109.85</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>Emma's Excellent Team</strong></td><td>1-5</td><td>91.76</td></tr> <tr><td><strong>Michael's Managable Team</strong></td><td>4-2</td><td>131.77</td></tr> </tbody></table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week6"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry></feed>
