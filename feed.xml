</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="lamar-jackson-qb">Lamar Jackson (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The star QB left last Wednesday‚Äôs practice early because a teammate stepped on his foot, and since then the team has downplayed the issue. Jackson‚Äôs presence at Monday‚Äôs practice should ease any lingering concerns on that front, though it‚Äôs unclear if he‚Äôll be deemed a full participant Monday.</p> <h4 id="joe-flacco-qb">Joe Flacco (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Flacco was nearly flawless while working the Browns‚Äô first three drives, capping the second with a 15-yard TD strike to rookie tight end Harold Fannin. The 41-year-old is set as the Week 1 starter for Cleveland, and while the team may choose to take a look at one of the quarterbacks it selected in the 2025 Draft, Dillon Gabriel or Shedeur Sanders, if the season goes off the rails, Flacco offers a much more stable floor for the passing game, and targets such as Jerry Jeudy and David Njoku.</p> <h4 id="marvin-mims-jr-wr">Marvin Mims Jr. (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Broncos coach Sean Payton said after Mims was forced to depart last Wednesday‚Äôs practice early that he was expected to retake the field Monday, so it‚Äôs encouraging to see the 2023 second-rounder following that timetable without any setbacks. By all indications, Mims is only dealing with a minor groin injury and remains on track for Sunday‚Äôs regular-season opener against the Titans.</p> <h4 id="nico-collins-wr">Nico Collins (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Collins played on the first two drives with the rest of the Texans‚Äô first-team offense and caught his touchdown from five yards out on fourth down to cap off the full first unit‚Äôs time in the game. Collins is once again primed for a massive role in Houston‚Äôs air attack this coming season, especially with Tank Dell (PUP-knee) still facing a highly uncertain return timeline.</p> <h4 id="brock-bowers-te">Brock Bowers (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Bowers logged only one offensive snap in Las Vegas‚Äô first preseason contest Aug. 7, but he got more run against San Francisco. The second-year tight end‚Äôs lone catch was a beauty ‚Äì he went up for a heave from Geno Smith that was contested by a 49ers defender and came down with the ball for a 28-yard gain. After setting an NFL rookie record with 112 receptions last year, Bowers figures to be Smith‚Äôs top target in 2025, and he‚Äôs arguably fantasy‚Äôs most alluring tight-end option.</p> <h4 id="jaylen-waddle-wr">Jaylen Waddle (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Waddle played along with most of Miami‚Äôs healthy starting offensive unit and was on the field for three possessions. He made his lone catch on the final drive on a pass delivered by Tua Tagovailoa, and Waddle will now turn his focus toward a Week 1 matchup against the Colts.</p> <h4 id="tua-tagovailoa-qb">Tua Tagovailoa (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Tagovailoa made his preseason debut and led three offensive possessions, the final of which ended with a touchdown. Though Jaylen Waddle also played, Tagovailoa primarily targeted Malik Washington, who did the majority of the work on Tagovailoa‚Äôs 25-yard touchdown pass. Most importantly, he came from the contest healthy and will be locked in as the starting quarterback for Miami‚Äôs Week 1 matchup against the Colts.</p> <h4 id="jordan-addison-wr">Jordan Addison (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Suspension <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Addison appeared to hurt his hand or arm Wednesday, resulting in him spending the rest of practice off the field as an observer. That he‚Äôs avoided any sort of serious issue is an especially positive development considering that both Justin Jefferson (hamstring) and Jalen Nailor (hand) currently are nursing injuries of their own. Jefferson, at least, returned to practice Monday and has begun ramping up his activity level with the goal of being fully healthy for Week 1 against the Bears on Monday, Sept. 8. Addison, for his part, will miss time early in the regular season due to his three-game suspension, though he‚Äôll be allowed to suit up for Friday‚Äôs preseason finale against the Titans if coach Kevin O‚ÄôConnell decides to play his starters.</p> <h4 id="jordan-mason-rb">Jordan Mason (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Getting the start with Aaron Jones held out of the lineup Minnesota‚Äôs exhibition opener, Mason saw a heavy workload on the team‚Äôs first drive and then checked out of the contest. Mason was very productive last season with the 49ers in Kyle Shanahan‚Äôs RB-friendly scheme, but it‚Äôs not yet clear how big a role he‚Äôll have with the Vikings behind Jones, who is coming off a 2024 campaign in which he amassed 1,546 scrimmage yards and played all 17 regular-season games.</p> <h4 id="garrett-wilson-wr">Garrett Wilson (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Wilson has yet to record a catch on four passes from new QB Justin Fields through two exhibitions, but the former‚Äôs standing as the unquestioned No. 1 option in the Jets‚Äô passing game isn‚Äôt in question. Once Week 1 rolls around, Wilson should be good for the typical 9.2 targets per game that he‚Äôs averaged through three pro campaigns, all of which have resulted in 1,000-yard seasons.</p> <h4 id="jaylen-warren-rb">Jaylen Warren (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Pittsburgh initially inked Warren via his second-year restricted free agent tender in March, a one-year deal, but per Gerry Dulac of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette his new deal extends through the 2027 season. That provides the Steelers with some long-term backfield clarity, with Warren and rookie third-round pick Kaleb Johnson positioned as a running back tandem for the foreseeable future. For the 2025 campaign Kenneth Gainwell, who is on a one-year deal, could also have a consistent role. Warren will be the favorite to operate as Pittsburgh‚Äôs starter early in the regular season, and beginning Sunday on the road versus the Jets. Per Ian Rapoport of NFL Network, Warren‚Äôs two-year deal includes over a $7 million contract for 2025 and $12 million guaranteed.</p> <h4 id="jauan-jennings-wr">Jauan Jennings (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Jennings, who continues to seek a new contract with the 49ers after having requested a trade, is back on the practice field for the first time since late July. General manager John Lynch said in late August that the team doesn‚Äôt intend to trade Jennings, but he spoke of the wide receiver‚Äôs availability for Week 1 in uncertain terms. Even if Jennings is only practicing on a limited basis, his return to the field is a significant step in the right direction. Wednesday‚Äôs first official practice report of the week will shed more light on Jennings‚Äô chances of suiting up Sunday versus the Seahawks.</p> <h4 id="tyjae-spears-rb">Tyjae Spears (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Injured Reserve <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The move ensures that Spears, who has been managing a high-ankle sprain, will miss at least the first four games of the regular season. Tony Pollard will lead the team‚Äôs backfield, with Julius Chestnut and Kalel Mullings (ankle) left to handle complementary snaps in Spears‚Äô absence, though it‚Äôs possible that the Titans will add another running back from among other teams‚Äô cut-downs.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_1_2025_90s_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_1_2025_90s_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week1"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">TBD Week 1 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-1-CTR/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="TBD Week 1 Report"/><published>2025-09-03T01:20:26+00:00</published><updated>2025-09-03T01:20:26+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-1-CTR</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-1-CTR/"><![CDATA[<pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="bryce-young-qb">Bryce Young (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Young and his first-unit teammates played only two series, and as his final line indicates, the 2023 first overall pick couldn‚Äôt get on the board as a passer. He targeted Ja‚ÄôTavion Sanders and rookie sensation Tetairoa McMillan with his two throws, with the former unable to find the handle on his opportunity despite the ball hitting his hands. He also saw his first pass intercepted by Derek Stingley and returned 31 yards into Panthers territory, but the play was nullified by a defensive holding penalty. While it was an underwhelming cameo for Young to say the least, expectations remain high for him in Year 2 in Dave Canales‚Äô offense, and he also was sharp during joint practices against Houston earlier in the week. Young‚Äôs preseason now is complete, as David Newton of ESPN.com reports Canales already has ruled out playing starters in Thursday night‚Äôs home preseason finale against the Steelers.</p> <h4 id="chase-brown-rb">Chase Brown (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Brown played the opening drive and accounted for all five of Cincinnati‚Äôs RB touches on the series, after getting all eight touches across two drives in the previous preseason game. His final carry was a one-yard TD plunge on fourth down, with Samaje Perine then taking over on the next drive. Perine may have a role on clear passing situations, but it looks like Brown will open the regular season handling most of Cincinnati‚Äôs backfield snaps and a huge share of the carries. If it doesn‚Äôt work out, the Bengals have Perine and rookie sixth-round pick Tahj Brooks as favorites for the second and third spots on the depth chart. They‚Äôll open the regular season with a road game against the Browns at 1:00 p.m. ET on Sunday, Sept. 7.</p> <h4 id="jerry-jeudy-wr">Jerry Jeudy (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Jeudy also sat out the team‚Äôs preseason opener, so his last chance to log exhibition snaps will occur Aug. 23 against the Rams. As the coming season approaches, Jeudy remains entrenched as the No. 1 option in a Cleveland wideout corps that also includes Cedric Tillman, Jamari Thrash and Diontae Johnson.</p> <h4 id="trevor-lawrence-qb">Trevor Lawrence (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> As the team‚Äôs regular-season opener approaches, the Jaguars will focus on keeping Lawrence ‚Äì who was limited to 10 games last season ‚Äì healthy and ready to face Carolina. As long as he can avoid injuries, Lawrence is bounce-back candidate this year while working with Coen, who‚Äôs coming off a successful season as Tampa‚Äôs Bay‚Äôs offensive coordinator. In addition to ascending second-year wideout Brian Thomas, Travis Hunter, the No. 2 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, provides Lawrence with another intriguing playmaker in a pass-catching corps that also includes WRs Dyami Brown and Parker Washington and TE Brenton Strange.</p> <h4 id="brenton-strange-te">Brenton Strange (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Strange played one offensive possession with the Jaguars‚Äô starting skill-position unit and hauled in his only target over the middle of the field. The offseason departure of Evan Engram leaves Strange as the clear top tight end on the depth chart, though it may be hard for him to be a consistent fantasy contributor due to target competition from the likes of Brian Thomas and Travis Hunter.</p> <h4 id="xavier-worthy-wr">Xavier Worthy (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Worthy logged his first reception of the preseason after seeing the field briefly with the rest of the starters last week against the Seahawks. The gadget receiver avoided the league‚Äôs concussion protocol after going down hard in practice earlier in camp. Worthy could see an expanded role on offense this season with fellow wideout Rashee Rice expected to miss a significant chunk of the season due to an impending league suspension, Tom Pelissero of the NFL Network reports. The latter may be active for the first four games of the season until a ruling is made, but expect Worthy to operate as the team‚Äôs top receiver for a good portion of the fantasy campaign.</p> <h4 id="patrick-mahomes-qb">Patrick Mahomes (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Mahomes ramped up his preseason workload after logging just three snaps on offense over the Chiefs‚Äô previous two exhibition games. The superstar QB looked to be in mid-season form while orchestrating two lengthy scoring drives (15 total plays) in one quarter of action. Mahomes threw for a career-low 3,928 yards while tying his previous worst of 26 touchdowns across 16 contests in 2024. The 29-year-old will be poised to improve on those totals this upcoming year with fellow All-Pro Travis Kelce and an improving group of young talent around him.</p> <h4 id="stefon-diggs-wr">Stefon Diggs (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Though Diggs didn‚Äôt suit up for any preseason games, he doesn‚Äôt appear to have hit any snags in his recovery from the torn ACL he sustained Oct. 27, 2024 while playing with the Texans. After signing with New England in March, the veteran wideout avoided placement on the PUP list ahead of training camp and didn‚Äôt experience any apparent restrictions in practices. The Patriots‚Äô first injury report Wednesday will clarify whether Diggs was a full participant in practice. If he opens the week without limitations, he should be ready to serve as New England‚Äôs No. 1 receiver Sunday.</p> <h4 id="cam-skattebo-rb">Cam Skattebo (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Making his preseason debut after a hamstring injury cost him a few weeks, Skattebo got the start on a night when Tyrone Tracy and Devin Singletary were among the many players rested. Skattebo played the first two drives and gained four yards on each of his three carries before calling it a night. Tracy appears to be the starter for Week 1 against Washington, with both Skattebo and Singletary candidates for roles off the bench. All the missed time during training camp and the preseason killed any chance Skattebo might‚Äôve had to push Tracy for the lead role Week 1.</p> <h4 id="braelon-allen-rb">Braelon Allen (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Allen split the backfield work with No. 1 RB Breece Hall during the Jets‚Äô first two drives, and the former ended up outgaining his position mate by eight yards on the same number of rushes. Through two exhibitions, Allen has 15 carries for 67 yards, which amounts to 4.5 YPC (or nearly 1.0 yard more than the 3.6 he averaged as a rookie last season). The sample size is small, but it appears as if Allen will be in the mix for touches early and often alongside Hall in 2025.</p> <h4 id="brandon-aiyuk-wr">Brandon Aiyuk (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Out <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> This is merely a procedural move, as coach Kyle Shanahan has circled (in his mind) a Week 6 road matchup with the Buccaneers as a possible date for Aiyuk to make his 2025 debut, per Vic Tafur of The Athletic. With this move from active/PUP to reserve/PUP, though, Aiyuk technically can return to action as early as Thursday, Oct. 2 at the Rams. He remains in recovery mode from the ACL and MCL tears that he sustained in his right knee Week 7 of last season. With Demarcus Robinson suspended for the first three games of the season, Jauan Jennings (calf) and Ricky Pearsall are the top wide receivers on San Francisco‚Äôs active roster.</p> <h4 id="chris-godwin-jr-wr">Chris Godwin Jr. (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Godwin suffered a season-ending dislocated left ankle in Week 7 of last season that required surgery. In early March, he inked a three-year, $66 million contract to remain with the Buccaneers, and while there was optimism from coach Todd Bowles during the offseason program that Godwin may be available for the beginning of the 2025 campaign, he opened training camp on active/PUP. Now that he‚Äôs been cleared to practice, the veteran wideout can return to action as soon as Week 1, although an October return still appears likely, per Adam Schefter of ESPN. By keeping him off the PUP list, which would require a minimum four-game absence, the Bucs are at least keeping open the possibility of a late September return. As long as Godwin remains sidelined, Mike Evans and rookie first-round pick Emeka Egbuka will serve as the team‚Äôs top two wide receivers with Jalen McMillan out due to a sprained neck.</p> <h4 id="zach-ertz-te">Zach Ertz (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Ertz and John Bates are both being rested ‚Äì in Ertz‚Äôs case for a third straight week ‚Äì while 2024 second-round pick Ben Sinnott isn‚Äôt among the 33 names being held out. It‚Äôs the latest sign that Sinnott has made no real progress toward usurping Ertz, although there‚Äôs perhaps still some risk it eventually happens. In any case, Ertz gets a solid target projection for Week 1 against the Giants, putting him in play as a lineup option even though he was drafted as a backup (or not at all) in most fantasy leagues. The uncertainty surrounding Terry McLaurin (contract) and Noah Brown (undisclosed injury) could further boost Ertz‚Äôs volume outlook as the opener draws near, with the wideouts potentially having workload limitations even if they both end up playing (following prolonged absences this summer).</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_1_2025_CTR_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_1_2025_CTR_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week1"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Mama Daughter Duo Week 1 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-1-JST/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mama Daughter Duo Week 1 Report"/><published>2025-09-03T01:20:26+00:00</published><updated>2025-09-03T01:20:26+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-1-JST</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-1-JST/"><![CDATA[<pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="michael-penix-jr-qb">Michael Penix Jr. (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Penix and veteran backup Kirk Cousins will both sit out a third consecutive preseason game, with Falcons coach Raheem Morris opting to rest veteran starters until the regular season. Atlanta waived quarterback Emory Jones (concussion) with an injury designation Monday, per Tori McElhaney of the Falcons‚Äô official site, leaving Easton Stick and new signee Ben DiNucci in position for preseason reps versus Dallas.</p> <h4 id="jalen-coker-wr">Jalen Coker (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Injured Reserve <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Panthers head coach Dave Canales said Coker has a ‚Äúserious quad strain,‚Äù per Mike Kaye of The Charlotte Observer. While the second-year wideout‚Äôs placement on IR allows him to retake the field after a minimum of only four games, it sounds like his return could be postponed until as late as Week 7 against the Jets on Sunday, Oct. 19. With Carolina also having traded Adam Thielen to Minnesota, the team inked veteran wideout Hunter Renfrow to the active roster Saturday to help provide depth behind Tetairoa McMillan (hamstring) and Xavier Legette.</p> <h4 id="rome-odunze-wr">Rome Odunze (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Odunze showed marked improvement over his catchless outing last week with Friday‚Äôs team-leading performance. The 2024 first-round pick caught QB Caleb Williams‚Äô only passing touchdown while also finishing with Chicago‚Äôs longest reception (37 yards). Odunze will attempt to build off of a modest 54-734-3 receiving line as a rookie when the Bears kick off the regular season against the Vikings on Sept. 8.</p> <h4 id="dandre-swift-rb">D‚ÄôAndre Swift (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Swift made his 2025 preseason debut Friday after sitting out an additional game against Buffalo last week. The 26-year-old moved the ball well on eight touches as he prepares to lead Chicago‚Äôs backfield for the second consecutive campaign. Swift generated 1,345 yards from scrimmage and six touchdowns in 17 regular-season starts last year, numbers he could easily reproduce with a clean bill of health in 2025.</p> <h4 id="caleb-williams-qb">Caleb Williams (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Williams carried the momentum over from his impressive preseason debut into Friday‚Äôs exhibition finale where he dialed up Rome Odunze for a touchdown late in the first half. Chicago‚Äôs offense sputtered out of the gates with a pair of punts, but Williams was unfazed and finished with another encouraging performance with Week 1 just around the corner. Expectations will be high for Williams when his sophomore season officially kicks off on Sept. 8 against the Vikings, after the organization signed the hottest head coaching free agent in Ben Johnson and surrounded the signal-caller with a talented supporting cast.</p> <h4 id="jayden-reed-wr">Jayden Reed (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Reed returned to practice Wednesday after resting for three weeks, acknowledging afterward that he wasn‚Äôt 100 percent and was still ‚Äúworking through‚Äù the injury. It‚Äôs an issue that often requires surgery and a multi-month timeline for rehab/recovery in such a scenario. He‚Äôll thus try to avoid surgery, or at least delay it until the offseason, but his fantasy value plunges with the added injury risk (and possibility of reduced performance or limited workloads). Reed intends to play Week 1, although Green Bay‚Äôs medical staff has a reputation for being cautious with injured players. He‚Äôs participating in Thursday‚Äôs padded practice scrimmage, per Rob Demovsky of ESPN.com.</p> <h4 id="travis-kelce-te">Travis Kelce (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> A slimmer Kelce made his preseason debut Friday after sitting out the Chiefs‚Äô first two exhibitions. The 35-year-old decided to lace up for a 13th season after his team was unceremoniously bounced from the Super Bowl by the Eagles in 2024. Kelce‚Äôs numbers have been steadily declining since his last 1,000-yard season back in 2022. That said, an over-the-hill Kelce still warrants fantasy consideration at a very shallow position.</p> <h4 id="hunter-henry-te">Hunter Henry (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> After logging six snaps in the Patriots‚Äô preseason opener, Henry didn‚Äôt see action in the team‚Äôs final two exhibition tilts, with an eye toward keeping him healthy ahead of Week 1. Henry, who is coming off a 2024 regular season in which he recorded a receiving line of 66/674/2 on 97 targets in 16 games, approaches the coming campaign as New England‚Äôs top pass-catching option in a TE corps that also returns Austin Hooper, who recorded 45 catches on 59 targets while working in tandem with Henry last year.</p> <h4 id="chris-olave-wr">Chris Olave (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Olave finished in a three-way tie for the team lead in receptions while profiling as the runner-up in receiving yards. The 2022 first-round pick made catches of 12, seven and 10 yards while working with Spencer Rattler on the Saints‚Äô first three drives, and he‚Äôll head into the regular season poised to reprise his No. 1 receiver role while working with either Rattler or rookie Tyler Shough as his quarterback.</p> <h4 id="devonta-smith-wr">DeVonta Smith (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> That‚Äôs also the case with A.J. Brown (hamstring), so the Eagles will indeed have both wideouts available for Week 1 action. As the coming season approaches, Smith and Brown remain the team‚Äôs clear-cut top two options at their position, with Jahan Dotson, John Metchie and Darius Cooper rounding out Philadelphia‚Äôs WR corps.</p> <h4 id="jalen-hurts-qb">Jalen Hurts (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Hurts didn‚Äôt play in the preseason as the Eagles used the exhibition slate to evaluate their backup quarterback options after trading away Kenny Pickett in the offseason. Hurts didn‚Äôt need the reps after leading Philadelphia to a Super Bowl title last season, but he‚Äôll be ready to go for the start of regular-season play against the Cowboys on Thursday, Sept. 4. He‚Äôs being drafted as a consensus top-five fantasy quarterback in most formats after averaging 20 passing touchdowns and 13 rushing TDs over the past four regular seasons.</p> <h4 id="kaleb-johnson-rb">Kaleb Johnson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Johnson came in at the start of the third drive, after Jaylen Warren and Kenneth Gainwell were done playing (but before the first-string offensive linemen were removed). The rookie had gains of seven and eight yards on his carries behind the starting O-line, and he didn‚Äôt play at all after halftime. It was a nice finish to the preseason, with back-to-back solid outings after struggling in Pittsburgh‚Äôs opener, but Johnson won‚Äôt necessarily have a large role come Week 1 against the Jets. That doesn‚Äôt mean he won‚Äôt be a key part of the offense as the season progresses, but there‚Äôs risk of a three-man committee initially, with Warren presumably starting and Gainwell seemingly on track for at least a small role.</p> <h4 id="christian-mccaffrey-rb">Christian McCaffrey (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> McCaffrey won‚Äôt see any exhibition action this year, but by all accounts he‚Äôs been looking like his pre-2024 self after dealing with Achilles tendinitis in both legs and a PCL sprain in his right knee last season. In parts of three campaigns since being traded from Carolina to San Francisco in October 2022, he‚Äôs averaged 115.5 yards from scrimmage per game and scored 31 TDs in 31 regular-season games.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_1_2025_JST_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_1_2025_JST_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week1"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Fantasy Guru Kayden Week 1 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-1-KTT/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Fantasy Guru Kayden Week 1 Report"/><published>2025-09-03T01:20:26+00:00</published><updated>2025-09-03T01:20:26+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-1-KTT</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-1-KTT/"><![CDATA[<pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="evan-engram-te">Evan Engram (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Engram was naturally part of the first-team offense over the first three drives, but he closed out his preseason in quiet fashion after making a splash with a 58-yard catch against the Cardinals last Saturday. The veteran tight end is teed up for a significant role in the Broncos‚Äô Bo Nix-led offense, beginning with their Week 1 home matchup against the Titans.</p> <h4 id="joe-mixon-rb">Joe Mixon (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Out <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Mixon is officially out the first four games of the year after having been placed on the Reserve/Non-Football Injury list Tuesday, but when prompted Wednesday for more clarity about a timetable for his potential return to the field, all Caserio said was that the team will ‚Äútake it one day at a time,‚Äù and that players on IR or the NFI lists will be evaluated ‚Äúafter four weeks and see where they are in their progression and then make a determination.‚Äù Mixon has been sidelined throughout spring activities, training camp and the preseason, leaving Nick Chubb, Dameon Pierce, Woody Marks and Dare Ogunbowale as Houston‚Äôs top backfield options to open the regular season.</p> <h4 id="brian-thomas-jr-wr">Brian Thomas Jr. (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Thomas played two drives and worked as the top target for Trevor Lawrence over that span, especially in the absence of rookie wide receiver Travis Hunter (upper body). Expectations for Thomas are sky high after a 1,282-yard, 10-touchdown rookie regular season. The Jaguars will wrap up preseason play with a trip to Miami on Saturday.</p> <h4 id="rashee-rice-wr">Rashee Rice (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Suspension <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Rice‚Äôs suspension will begin immediately, as he and the NFL reached an agreement Wednesday on an arrangement that will force him to miss the first six weeks of the regular season but allow him to retake the field mid-season. He will first be eligible for reinstatement and to resume practicing Oct. 13 and to make his regular-season debut in Week 7 versus the Raiders on Oct. 19. JuJu Smith-Schuster figures to join Xavier Worthy and Hollywood Brown (ankle) in the majority of three-wide sets until Rice is reinstated.</p> <h4 id="isiah-pacheco-rb">Isiah Pacheco (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Pacheco handled the first and last touches of Kansas City‚Äôs opening drive Friday, the latter of which netted him a two-yard touchdown. It is worth mentioning that veteran backup Kareem Hunt got the first crack at the goal line from three yards out on the previous carry before giving way to Pacheco. That‚Äôs a scenario that could pop up during the regular season, where Pacheco has scoring opportunities poached by Hunt from in close. The 26-year-old Pacheco is still the preferred option for both his team and fantasy managers when the Chiefs take on the Chargers to open the season on Sept. 5 in Sao Paulo, Brazil.</p> <h4 id="ladd-mcconkey-wr">Ladd McConkey (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> McConkey played one series with the majority of the Chargers‚Äô starters, including Justin Herbert. He hauled in his only target over the middle of the field and made a few defenders miss to pick up extra yardage. McConkey may not see the field again until Week 1 of the regular season, but his rapport with Herbert appears to be on track.</p> <h4 id="devon-achane-rb">De‚ÄôVon Achane (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Achane will practice for the first time since he sustained a soft-tissue calf injury Aug. 16, a notable step in the right direction even if he‚Äôs limited in his return to on-field work. McDaniel has consistently indicated that Achane is on track to play Week 1, though Miami has taken a cautious approach to his recovery and prioritized avoiding any setbacks. With Jaylen Wright (leg) not practicing Monday and trending in the wrong direction Week 1, expanded backfield opportunities behind Achane figure to be on tap for rookie Ollie Gordon, who McDaniel said ‚Äútook advantage of an inopportune health situation,‚Äù C. Isaiah Smalls II of the Miami Herald reports.</p> <h4 id="kendre-miller-rb">Kendre Miller (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Miller handled the first running back opportunity for the Saints and rattled off gains of eight and seven yards on his first two carries, with the second one wiped out by an offensive holding call. The oft-injured 2023 third-round pick is getting a fresh start with the new coaching staff in New Orleans, and he seems to be locked into the No. 2 role behind Alvin Kamara heading into a Week 1 home matchup against the Cardinals.</p> <h4 id="wandale-robinson-wr">Wan‚ÄôDale Robinson (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> As with most of New York‚Äôs key players, Robinson‚Äôs time on the field was brief ‚Äì he played just seven offensive snaps, a bit fewer than fellow WR roster locks Darius Slayton (10) and Jalin Hyatt (11). Nonetheless, Robinson was the only member of that trio to get multiple targets, and his lone catch came on a short hookup with Russell Wilson. Robinson got a healthy 140 targets and caught 93 of them last season, though he averaged only 7.5 YPC. Malik Nabers (toe/shoulder) hasn‚Äôt yet played in a preseason game, and he‚Äôs expected to get the lion‚Äôs share of attention among New York‚Äôs receiving corps again in 2025. That should leave Robinson, Slayton and (to a lesser extent) Hyatt competing for looks from a new QB room that features Wilson, Jameis Winston and rookie Jaxson Dart.</p> <h4 id="darius-slayton-wr">Darius Slayton (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Slayton had been working through an undisclosed injury that caused him to miss the Giants‚Äô preseason opener against the Bills, but the 2019 fifth-rounder progressed enough in his recovery to suit up Saturday. Slayton is entering the final year of his two-year contract and is aiming to bounce back from a disappointing 2024 regular season in which his 39 catches for 573 yards were his lowest output since 2021 (26 catches for 339 yards). The Giants‚Äô quarterback situation in 2024 was shaky, but the addition of Russell Wilson should help raise Slayton‚Äôs floor this season.</p> <h4 id="aaron-rodgers-qb">Aaron Rodgers (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Rodgers will sit out a third consecutive preseason game, as will No. 1 receiver DK Metcalf and star pass rushers T.J. Watt and Cameron Heyward. The veteran quarterback will have to wait until the Steelers‚Äô Week 1 opener to take on his former team, the Jets, on the road and make his debut in offensive coordinator Arthur Smith‚Äôs scheme. Mason Rudolph will start under center once again Thursday.</p> <h4 id="baker-mayfield-qb">Baker Mayfield (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Buccaneers used some starters in their second preseason game, but Mayfield wasn‚Äôt one of them. They‚Äôll start Kyle Trask at QB this Saturday, followed by Teddy Bridgewater, allowing the two to continue their competition for the backup QB job. Mayfield, meanwhile, will be on the sideline to keep him healthy ahead of a Week 1 game at Atlanta. The Buccaneers may not have WR Chris Godwin (ankle), WR Jalen McMillan (neck) or LT Tristan Wirfs (knee) available for the contest, but they seem confident in first-round pick Emeka Egbuka stepping up to replace Godwin/McMillan, at least.</p> <h4 id="austin-ekeler-rb">Austin Ekeler (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Ekeler and rookie Jacory Croskey-Merritt are the two running backs on Washington‚Äôs list of players that won‚Äôt participate. It‚Äôs a sign they‚Äôll share work come Week 1 against the Giants, although there‚Äôs also talk of Chris Rodriguez having a role, which might include short-yardage carries. The Commanders traded Brian Robinson to San Francisco for a sixth-round pick Friday, showing confidence in some combination of Ekeler, Croskey-Merritt, Rodriguez and Jeremy McNichols to form a committee. Ekeler‚Äôs receiving skills make his role the most secure, although he‚Äôs on the downside of his career and has fumbled 18 times (including playoffs) in 63 games over the past four season.</p> <h4 id="jayden-daniels-qb">Jayden Daniels (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> There‚Äôs a list of 33 players that won‚Äôt take part Saturday, including Daniels, Marcus Mariota, Austin Ekeler, Jacory Croskey-Merritt, Terry McLaurin (contract), Deebo Samuel, Noah Brown (undisclosed), Jaylin Lane, Zach Ertz and John Bates. The next time we see most of them will be a Week 1 home game against the Giants.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_1_2025_KTT_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_1_2025_KTT_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week1"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Michael‚Äôs Managable Team Week 1 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-1-MMT/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Michael‚Äôs Managable Team Week 1 Report"/><published>2025-09-03T01:20:26+00:00</published><updated>2025-09-03T01:20:26+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-1-MMT</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-1-MMT/"><![CDATA[<pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="khalil-shakir-wr">Khalil Shakir (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Shakir is back on the practice field for the first time since suffering a right high-ankle sprain Aug. 1, so even being restricted to limited reps would represent a significant step in the right direction. Head coach Sean McDermott has expressed optimism about Shakir‚Äôs chances of being available Week 1, so even if Buffalo opts to take a cautious approach to the No. 1 wideout‚Äôs health, look for his activity level to ramp up in advance of Buffalo‚Äôs regular-season opener against Baltimore on Sunday, Sept. 7.</p> <h4 id="rj-harvey-rb">RJ Harvey (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Harvey was the first running back to record a carry, and he was in on Denver‚Äôs first three possessions overall with the rest of the first-team offense. The rookie second-round pick got some solid work in during preseason, finishing Denver‚Äôs three-game exhibition slate with a 13-47 rushing line and three receptions for seven yards on four targets. Harvey heads into his first NFL season set to operate in tandem with veteran J.K. Dobbins atop the Broncos‚Äô running back depth chart.</p> <h4 id="woody-marks-rb">Woody Marks (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The 2025 fourth-round pick made a strong final impression for the coaching staff, scoring the Texans‚Äô first TD of the afternoon on a nine-yard run early in the second quarter. With Joe Mixon (foot/ankle) uncertain for Week 1 and potentially headed for a stay on the PUP list, Marks could have a role in the offense right out of the gate behind Nick Chubb and Dameon Pierce.</p> <h4 id="daniel-jones-qb">Daniel Jones (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Colts coach Shane Steichen reportedly informed Jones and Anthony Richardson of his decision Tuesday morning. There wasn‚Äôt a decisive winner in the QB competition over two preseason games, but Jones seemingly made a better impression on the practice field this spring and summer. His poor track record with the Giants suggests Richardson is likely to make starts at some point this season, however.</p> <h4 id="bhayshul-tuten-rb">Bhayshul Tuten (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Tuten tied for the team lead in carries but served as the third back. Travis Etienne worked exclusively with the starting skill-position unit, with Tank Bigsby following him. That left Tuten to work primarily late in the second quarter and much of the second half. He did find the end zone from eight yards away early in the fourth quarter, but his role come the regular season is in question.</p> <h4 id="tre-harris-wr">Tre‚Äô Harris (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Harris exited a practice last Wednesday due to an unspecified issue, but his absence from the Week 1 injury report implies that he took every rep during Tuesday‚Äôs session. The rookie second-round receiver out of Ole Miss will be available for Friday‚Äôs season opener versus the Chiefs in Sao Paulo, Brazil, but it‚Äôs unclear if he‚Äôll be able to immediately earn meaningful target volume on the perimeter after the Chargers brought aboard veteran slot man Keenan Allen in August to complement No. 1 wideout Ladd McConkey and third-year man Quentin Johnston.</p> <h4 id="justin-herbert-qb">Justin Herbert (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Herbert made a brief appearance, leading one drive that went nine plays and 51 yards. Though his completion percentage left something to be desired, Herbert displayed plenty to be encouraged about, connecting early with Ladd McConkey on a short pass before hitting KeAndre Lambert-Smith for a 29-yard gain down the left sideline. Herbert may not see the field again until the regular season, but he appears ready to roll if that is the case.</p> <h4 id="tj-hockenson-te">T.J. Hockenson (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> It was surprising to see Hockenson play in the first preseason game given his injury scare earlier in the week. Even though he didn‚Äôt do much in the game, it shows he‚Äôs ready for the regular season.</p> <h4 id="drake-maye-qb">Drake Maye (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Maye logged two drives apiece in both of the Patriots‚Äô first two exhibitions, completing seven of 12 passes for 58 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions, rushing twice for 16 yards and a TD and losing a fumble. He thus has a number of reps under his belt ahead of his second campaign after throwing for 2,276 yards and a 15:10 TD:INT on 66.6 percent passing and turning 54 carries into 421 yards and two scores in 13 regular-season appearances (12 starts) as a rookie.</p> <h4 id="alvin-kamara-rb">Alvin Kamara (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Fantasy managers are just fine with that, after Kamara made it through training camp without any report of injury troubles or missed time. The Saints used some of their other starters in multiple preseason games, which allowed RB Kendre Miller to get a bunch of first-team work. Miller thus stands as the favorite to enter Week 1 against Arizona as Kamara‚Äôs top backup, although it‚Äôs a fluid situation, with rookie Devin Neal just recently coming back from a hamstring injury and Clyde Edwards-Helaire perhaps competing for a small role.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_1_2025_MMT_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_1_2025_MMT_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week1"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Americas Team Week 1 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-1-RRT/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Americas Team Week 1 Report"/><published>2025-09-03T01:20:26+00:00</published><updated>2025-09-03T01:20:26+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-1-RRT</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-1-RRT/"><![CDATA[<pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="trey-mcbride-te">Trey McBride (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The talented tight end was on the receiving end of Kyler Murray‚Äôs longest completion of the night, kickstarting Arizona‚Äôs second drive. McBride, who signed a four-year, $76 million extension in April, is ticketed for another massive role again in 2025 after recording 111 receptions for 1,146 yards and two touchdowns across 16 regular-season contests last season.</p> <h4 id="chuba-hubbard-rb">Chuba Hubbard (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Panthers‚Äô lead back was out there with his first-unit mates for two series, but Hubbard was sparsely used. That was also the case in the preseason opener against the Browns, as keeping the versatile back healthy for Week 1 is clearly a top priority. Hubbard will share the backfield with Rico Dowdle this coming season, which will likely lead to at least a slight hit to the former‚Äôs touches, but he should still be in line for a robust role as both runner and receiver.</p> <h4 id="jamarr-chase-wr">Ja‚ÄôMarr Chase (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Chase played just one drive Monday night, after catching four passes for 71 yards and a TD on two series in Cincinnati‚Äôs preseason opener. He‚Äôll likely be held out of the final preseason game, ahead of a Week 1 contest at Cleveland against a defense led by DE Myles Garrett and CB Denzel Ward. Chase caught 11 of 14 targets for 152 yards and two TDs in his two matchups with Cleveland last season, after having just one big game against the Browns through his first three years in the league.</p> <h4 id="dalton-schultz-te">Dalton Schultz (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The move to restructure Schultz‚Äôs 2025 pay from base salary into a signing bonus lowers the Texans‚Äô salary cap for this season, and the veteran tight end is still slated to make the $11 million he‚Äôs owed in 2026. Schultz played in all 17 regular-season games in 2024 and finished with 53 catches (on 85 targets) for 532 yards and two touchdowns, all of which were his lowest since the 2019 campaign as a member of the Cowboys.</p> <h4 id="josh-downs-wr">Josh Downs (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Downs has been dealing with a hamstring issue since Aug. 14, but it appears as though he‚Äôs not too far away from returning to practice. With that in mind, the wideout is trending toward being ready for Week 1 action, in the absence of any setbacks.</p> <h4 id="travis-etienne-jr-rb">Travis Etienne Jr. (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> All four of Etienne‚Äôs touches came on Jacksonville‚Äôs second drive after Tank Bigsby played the first drive, though both possessions featured the rest of the team‚Äôs healthy starters, including quarterback Trevor Lawrence. Etienne and Bigsby appear headed for a timeshare in the regular season, though rookie fourth-round pick Bhayshul Tuten is pushing to crack that rotation and helped his case by scoring a second-quarter touchdown with the backups Sunday. Etienne‚Äôs standing in the Jaguars‚Äô backfield competition is unlikely to change in the team‚Äôs preseason finale against the Dolphins on Saturday.</p> <h4 id="amari-cooper-wr">Amari Cooper (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> On the same day reports surfaced that Jakobi Meyers is seeking a trade, the Raiders move to bolster their wideout depth. Once Cooper is up to speed with the team‚Äôs offense, he should have an immediate opportunity to make his mark in a pass-catching corps that otherwise features Meyers (for now, at least) and TE Brock Bowers. In six games with the Browns and eight with the Bills in 2024, the 31-year-old ‚Äì who the Raiders drafted fourth overall in 2015 ‚Äì combined to record a 44-547-4 line on 85 targets.</p> <h4 id="matthew-stafford-qb">Matthew Stafford (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Stafford has practiced in full since his return to the field Aug. 18, so while him being named the Week 1 starter was expected, McVay hadn‚Äôt actually communicated the decision until now. With game day now approaching, the 37-year-old quarterback could begin having a cap on his reps as a form of load management, but barring a tangible setback in his recovery from the back injury that caused him to miss most of training camp and the preseason, fantasy managers will be able to count on Stafford‚Äôs presence under center, a notable development for Puka Nacua, Davante Adams and RB Kyren Williams. Per Stu Jackson of the Rams‚Äô official site, starting left tackle Alaric Jackson (tailbone/blood clots) also is expected to play Week 1.</p> <h4 id="rhamondre-stevenson-rb">Rhamondre Stevenson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Stevenson, who has been managing an unspecified injury that isn‚Äôt viewed as significant, sported a non-contact jersey in his return to practice this week, per Andrew Callahan of the Boston Herald, but there‚Äôs nothing to suggests that his Week 1 status is in any danger. Added clarity in that regard will arrive no later than the Patriots‚Äô first official injury/practice report, but as the coming season approaches Stevenson is set to reprise his key role in a backfield that also includes dynamic 2025 second-rounder TreVeyon Henderson, along with fellow returnee Antonio Gibson. Though Henderson remains the upside play from a fantasy standpoint and figures to cut into Stevenson‚Äôs volume this season, there should be enough touches, in an offense that could lean toward the run, for both players to carry weekly fantasy lineup utility.</p> <h4 id="spencer-rattler-qb">Spencer Rattler (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The NFL‚Äôs last remaining preseason QB competition finally reached its conclusion, as Rattler beat out rookie second-round pick Tyler Shough. In seven games (six starts) as a 2024 fifth-rounder last season, Rattler completed 130 of 228 passes (57 percent) for 1,317 yards, four touchdowns and five interceptions, while adding 18 carries for 146 yards and fumbling five times (three lost). He‚Äôll be under center for the Saints on Sunday, Sept. 7 against the Cardinals, but Rattler likely won‚Äôt have much job security.</p> <h4 id="aj-brown-wr">A.J. Brown (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The same applies to DeVonta Smith (groin), which paves the way for the Eagles‚Äô top two wideouts to be available for Week 1 action. Brown is coming off a 2024 regular season in which he recorded a 67-1,079-7 line on 97 targets in 13 contests and is in line to continue in his key role in a Philadelphia passing offense that runs largely through him, Smith and TE Dallas Goedert.</p> <h4 id="brian-robinson-jr-rb">Brian Robinson Jr. (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Christian McCaffrey has remained healthy all summer, but nearly all of the 49ers‚Äô other running backs have missed time with injuries, including Isaac Guerendo (shoulder). Guerendo did return to practice earlier this week, but there‚Äôs now risk he drops down the depth chart with San Francisco trading for Robinson, who has 40 starts and 22 TDs to his name in the NFL (including playoffs). The Commanders, meanwhile, are left with Austin Ekeler, Jacory Croskey-Merritt, Chris Rodriguez and Jeremy McNichols in the backfield. Washington reportedly will receive a sixth-round pick and eat some of Robinson‚Äôs $3.4 million base salary, Mike Garafolo of NFL Network reports.</p> <h4 id="sam-darnold-qb">Sam Darnold (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Coach Mike Macdonald said rookie QB Jalen Milroe will start and play the entire contest. Darnold will next be seen in action Week 1, when the Seahawks host the rival 49ers.</p> <h4 id="cooper-kupp-wr">Cooper Kupp (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Kupp made his official debut with the Seahawks after switching allegiances within the NFC West this past offseason. The veteran superstar had little to do in his one drive of action after Zach Charbonnet (5-45-1) stole the show on the ground. The end of Kupp‚Äôs tenure with the Rams saw his production dwarfed by injury, with his last 1,000-yard season coming during his MVP run in 2021. The 32-year-old will look for a fresh start while starting opposite Jaxon Smith-Njigba and catching passes from Sam Darnold in 2025.</p> <h4 id="jaxon-smith-njigba-wr">Jaxon Smith-Njigba (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Seattle‚Äôs key starters on offense got to see the field for the first drive of Friday‚Äôs exhibition before exiting with a clean bill of health. New starting QB Sam Darnold connected with Smith-Njigba for the first time as teammates for a short gain. With DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett joining different clubs this past offseason, Smith-Njigba will attempt to build off of last year‚Äôs fantasy breakout as Seattle‚Äôs undisputed No. 1 receiver in 2025.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_1_2025_RRT_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_1_2025_RRT_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week1"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">To Infinity and Bijan!

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="kyler-murray-qb">Kyler Murray (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Murray and the rest of the starters handled the first two possessions of the Cardinals‚Äô preseason opener against Kansas City on Aug. 9, but the first-team offense appears to have shown enough in practices since for Gannon to feel confident heading into Week 1. A consistent drumbeat throughout training camp has been the improved connection between Murray and second-year wideout Marvin Harrison, an encouraging development considering that Arizona made no notable changes to its skill-position personnel from last season. Murray and Harrison‚Äôs next opportunity to demonstrate their purportedly improved rapport will arrive during the regular-season opener in New Orleans on Sunday, Sept. 7.</p> <h4 id="darnell-mooney-wr">Darnell Mooney (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> It‚Äôs the second promising sign this week, after Mooney avoided an injury list on cutdown day, which suggests the Falcons expect him to play at some point in September. The return to practice Thursday seemingly even gives Mooney a shot to play Week 1 against Tampa Bay, with 10 days to ramp up after missing practice for a little over a month. The Falcons haven‚Äôt done anything to upgrade their WR room in the meantime ‚Äì perhaps another hint at confidence in Mooney‚Äôs September availability</p> <h4 id="mark-andrews-te">Mark Andrews (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Andrews didn‚Äôt practice Monday, but if he was dealing with any sort of injury, it appears it was only minor. Ravens general manager Eric DeCosta said Wednesday that he expects Isaiah Likely (foot) to be ‚Äúback in the early part of the season,‚Äù per Jamison Hensley of ESPN.com, but it remains to be seen whether Likely will be a candidate to return in time to suit up Week 1 versus the Bills. If Likely misses any regular-season games, Andrews will figure to see an uptick in targets and snaps while Charlie Kolar steps into the No. 2 tight end role.</p> <h4 id="keon-coleman-wr">Keon Coleman (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Allen said Coleman is ‚Äústill seeing a lot of growth in his game and just the nuance to playing the receiver position and doing the things that we‚Äôre asking him to do,‚Äù and that the second-year pro has ‚Äúconsistently‚Äù been ‚Äúa guy that can go and win‚Äù in one-on-one situations. With top wideout Khalil Shakir expected back for Week 1, but considered week-to-week due to a high-ankle sprain and currently not practicing, Coleman appears to be making the most of his increased opportunities. The 2024 second-round pick was primarily deployed as a downfield target as a rookie, but Buffalo‚Äôs addition of deep threat Joshua Palmer in free agency could open up a path for Coleman to see more flexible, fantasy-friendly utilization Year 2. Coleman‚Äôs size, body control, and potential to dominate in one-on-one situations provide him the upside of developing into a go-to red zone target for Allen, something the Bills lacked last season.</p> <h4 id="tetairoa-mcmillan-wr">Tetairoa McMillan (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> McMillan was sidelined a little more than a week due to a minor hamstring injury, but getting back on the field more than a week before Week 1 prep begins bodes well for the eighth overall pick in this year‚Äôs draft. It remains to be seen if he‚Äôll avoid the injury report entirely once Carolina is required to post one ahead of their season opener against Jacksonville.</p> <h4 id="javonte-williams-rb">Javonte Williams (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Signed to a one-year, $3 million deal in free agency this spring, Williams faced little competition in training camp as both Miles Sanders and rookie Jaydon Blue dealt with injuries. The Cowboys also treated Williams as the starter during the preseason, as he didn‚Äôt play in any of those three exhibitions. Despite those encouraging signs, Williams could end up serving as the lead option in a committee rather than operating as a true bell cow. The uncertainty of Williams‚Äô workload, coupled with the lack of efficiency he showed during his final two seasons in Denver after suffering a severe knee injury in 2022, make it difficult to insert him in fantasy lineups with much confidence this week.</p> <h4 id="isaac-teslaa-wr">Isaac TeSlaa (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Lions coach Dan Campbell said after the Lions‚Äô preseason finale 26-7 loss to Houston, in which TeSlaa caught both his targets for 41 yards and a touchdown, that the 2025 third-round pick is ‚Äúgoing to have some growing pains‚Äù but that ‚Äúwe‚Äôre very pleased with where he‚Äôs at after six weeks of camp‚Äù and ‚Äúif you took most receivers, he‚Äôd be in the upper echelon of those, as far as development‚Äù at this stage of his rookie season. Patrick operated as the No. 3 receiver for Detroit much of last season, and his departure now leaves that role up immediately for grabs between TeSlaa and Kalif Raymond.</p> <h4 id="josh-jacobs-rb">Josh Jacobs (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Jacobs suited up for the second time this preseason and once again made a very quick appearance. He took a carry on the first play of the game and then departed the contest to ensure he‚Äôs ready for a Week 1 matchup against the Lions. Jacobs should be in line for a heavy workload once again as the Packers‚Äô clear workhorse back.</p> <h4 id="nick-chubb-rb">Nick Chubb (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Texans will make Mixon‚Äôs placement on reserve/NFI official Tuesday. Mixon hasn‚Äôt practiced at all this summer and now will miss at least the first four games of the regular season, leaving the door open for Chubb, rookie Woody Marks and veterans Dameon Pierce and Dare Ogunbowale to jockey for backfield work. Chubb was rested for the preseason finale this past weekend, suggesting he‚Äôs the leader for the early-down role over Pierce. Marks and Ogunbowale profile more as pass-catching backs, though Marks certainly could grow into a larger role. Chubb has played in just 10 regular-season games over the last two seasons due to yet another severe knee injury, and he looked sluggish on 102 carries in 2024, turning them into 332 yards (3.3 yards per carry) and three touchdowns with Cleveland. He also doesn‚Äôt catch many passes, muting his fantasy appeal. Marks, a fourth-round rookie, comes at a cheaper cost in drafts and is five years younger with less wear and tear on his body.</p> <h4 id="quentin-johnston-wr">Quentin Johnston (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Chargers head coach John Harbaugh had already confirmed Monday that Johnston cleared the NFL‚Äôs five-step concussion protocol, and the third-year wideout‚Äôs absence from the injury report suggests that he practiced fully Tuesday and will be available for Friday‚Äôs season opener versus the Chiefs in Sao Paulo, Brazil. While Johnston projects to begin the 2025 campaign as a starter, the Chargers‚Äô offseason additions of veteran Keenan Allen and rookie second-round pick Tre Harris could cut into Johnston‚Äôs target share and playing time.</p> <h4 id="justin-jefferson-wr">Justin Jefferson (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Jefferson has been sidelined since late July by what has been described as a mild left hamstring strain, but the star wide receiver is ready to start ramping up his activity level. Per Kevin Seifert of ESPN.com, Jefferson will participate in part of Monday‚Äôs practice. Though Jefferson hasn‚Äôt yet been cleared to participate in team drills without limitations, this development nonetheless is a step in the right direction. Jefferson‚Äôs goal is to be ready for Week 1 against the Bears on Monday, Sept. 8, but he‚Äôs unlikely to suit up for Friday‚Äôs preseason finale against the Titans.</p> <h4 id="treveyon-henderson-rb">TreVeyon Henderson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> After an electric kickoff-return TD in the Patriots‚Äô exhibition opener last weekend, Henderson found paydirt again Saturday, this time on an eight-yard run on the team‚Äôs second possession of the afternoon that saw the rookie running back demonstrate both patience and his ability to power though contact. Rhamondre Stevenson (undisclosed) remains atop the depth chart, but it may just be a show of deference to the veteran after Henderson was selected 38th overall in the 2025 Draft to be one of the centerpieces of the offense.</p> <h4 id="malik-nabers-wr">Malik Nabers (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Nabers dealt with numerous health concerns in recent months, sitting out the offseason program due to a toe injury that dates back to college and also bothered him during a standout rookie season, then suffering a shoulder injury early in training camp before tightness in his back popped up. He didn‚Äôt play at all during the preseason, but he returned to practice last Monday and appeared to have no limitations while running at Wednesday‚Äôs session. Afterward, he said, ‚ÄúYeah, I feel like I‚Äôm always ready. When it‚Äôs game time and those lights are on, I believe my body‚Äôs going to turn it on.‚Äù Next Wednesday‚Äôs injury report will reveal whether or not Nabers has any limitations ahead of a Week 1 road matchup with the Commanders on Sunday, Sept. 7.</p> <h4 id="justin-fields-qb">Justin Fields (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Fields started New York‚Äôs first two preseason games but handled a total of just three offensive possessions. Per Zack Rosenblatt of The Athletic, Fields has rarely thrown the ball downfield throughout training camp, with New York‚Äôs offense instead focusing on the run game and short-area passes. That observation is reinforced by the fact that he‚Äôs averaging just 3.9 air yards per attempt across his limited exhibition action, and that all four of Fields‚Äô targets to No. 1 receiver Garrett Wilson this preseason have fallen incomplete. Glenn admitted after Saturday‚Äôs preseason loss to the Giants that ‚Äúour passing game has to be better,‚Äù saying that ‚Äúour guys know we‚Äôre going to put our heads down and go back to work.‚Äù Fields‚Äô rushing abilities have been sufficient to provide fantasy upside in the past, but for him to enter the mix as a consistent QB1 this season, the Jets‚Äô passing game will have to establish a better rhythm before a Week 1 contest against Pittsburgh.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_1_2025_TIB_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_1_2025_TIB_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week1"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">30 Years of Tears Week 1 Report</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-1-TOM/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="30 Years of Tears Week 1 Report"/><published>2025-09-03T01:20:26+00:00</published><updated>2025-09-03T01:20:26+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-1-TOM</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-1-TOM/"><![CDATA[<pre><code class="language-echarts">{

</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="marvin-harrison-jr-wr">Marvin Harrison Jr. (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> After hooking up with Murray for a 15-yard catch in the preseason opener versus Kansas City, Harrison and the rest of the Cardinals‚Äô No. 1 offense sat out this past Saturday‚Äôs game against Denver. Murray and Harrison connected on a number of passes against a tough Broncos secondary in a joint practice, however. Harrison is looking to build upon a 62-885-8 line on 116 targets over 17 regular-season games as a rookie, and the fourth overall pick in the 2024 Draft seems poised to break out based on early returns in training camp and the exhibition schedule.</p> <h4 id="joe-burrow-qb">Joe Burrow (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Burrow played in the first two preseason game, leading Cincinnati‚Äôs offense to four touchdowns (including three TD passes) on five drives. He‚Äôll play at Cleveland in Week 1, mostly surrounded by the same supporting cast as last season, plus TE Noah Fant and two new guards (Dylan Fairchild, Lucas Patrick) that are competing for starting jobs. The Bengals appear shootout-prone again, with minimal offseason upgrades on defense and star DE Trey Hendrickson (contract) missing all of training camp.</p> <h4 id="jk-dobbins-rb">J.K. Dobbins (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Dobbins‚Äô only touch of the night came on Denver‚Äôs first possession, one play after his first target of the night fell incomplete but was wiped off the books by an illegal use of hands penalty against San Francisco. Dobbins was the only one of the top four backs on Denver‚Äôs depth chart not to log a carry ‚Äì RJ Harvey, Audric Estime and Jaleel McLaughlin combined for 18 rush attempts ‚Äì but the veteran is almost certain to open the campaign in a prominent role and could certainly see more action in Denver‚Äôs second preseason contest next Saturday night at home against the Cardinals.</p> <h4 id="jared-goff-qb">Jared Goff (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> With Goff, who also didn‚Äôt play in last Thursday‚Äôs Hall of Fame Game against the Chargers, not slated to see action versus Atlanta, the report notes that Hendon Hooker is set to play the first half Friday, with Kyle Allen on track to play in the second half. Goff is entrenched as the Lions‚Äô starting QB ahead of Week 1, but according to Tim Twentyman of the team‚Äôs official site, Hooker and Allen are in a close competition to back up Goff.</p> <h4 id="romeo-doubs-wr">Romeo Doubs (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Doubs played for two offensive possessions along with other starters such as Matthew Golden, Tucker Kraft and Josh Jacobs. He caught his touchdown on a slant route on a pass from Malik Willis, who started the game for Green Bay. Most importantly, Doubs looks ready for the Packers‚Äô Week 1 matchup against the Lions after working through a back injury for much of the last two weeks.</p> <h4 id="matthew-golden-wr">Matthew Golden (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Golden played on the first two offensive possessions along with many of Green Bay‚Äôs top skill-position players, such as Josh Jacobs, Romeo Doubs and Tucker Kraft. He made a long contested catch down the right sideline on a throw from Malik Willis, showcasing his playmaking ability that will be a welcomed addition to the Packers‚Äô receiving corps. Golden looks locked into an immediate role as a starting outside receiver heading into a Week 1 matchup against the Lions.</p> <h4 id="jayden-higgins-wr">Jayden Higgins (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> The Texans rested their starters, including Nico Collins and Christian Kirk, for their final exhibition contest, and Higgins made only a brief cameo on the team‚Äôs first two drives before exiting. The 2025 second-round pick seems locked into the No. 3 spot on the depth chart due to Tank Dell (knee) still lacking a timeline for his return, and it‚Äôs a role that could result in significant volume for Higgins in a high-ceiling passing game led by C.J. Stroud.</p> <h4 id="travis-hunter-wr">Travis Hunter (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Hunter missed Jacksonville‚Äôs preseason finale due to an upper-body issue, but the team had consistently indicated that the injury was only minor. The rookie first-rounder is ready to make his regular-season debut Sunday, Sept. 7, though it remains to be seen exactly how the Jaguars intend to divvy up his snaps between offense and defense. Hunter has been listed as a starting wide receiver on the Jaguars‚Äô unofficial preseason depth charts, but the team‚Äôs first official regular-season depth chart, to be released during Week 1 prep, will provide a clearer indication of the dual-threat playmaker‚Äôs current standing on both sides of the ball.</p> <h4 id="ashton-jeanty-rb">Ashton Jeanty (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Jeanty logged the Raiders‚Äô first touch from scrimmage and shared time with Zamir White on the drive. Jeanty, the rookie first-round pick, had a relatively quiet first preseason as a pro, rushing 12 times for 37 yards and a touchdown while recording one catch for two yards over three games. That type of sparse usage should be a distant memory as soon as the regular season begins, as Jeanty is expected to handle a robust role in the Raiders‚Äô ground attack beginning with a Week 1 road matchup against the Patriots on Sunday, Sept. 7.</p> <h4 id="omarion-hampton-rb">Omarion Hampton (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Hampton played in one series with the rest of the Chargers‚Äô starters and logged gains of five and seven yards. More importantly, he was the only back to appear with the starting offensive unit, which included Justin Herbert. Hampton is likely to be a part of a rotation at the start of the regular season, though it remains to be seen if he is paired with Najee Harris (eye) or one of a few other running backs vying for a role in the team‚Äôs backfield.</p> <h4 id="ollie-gordon-ii-rb">Ollie Gordon II (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Gordon is fresh off an impressive preseason and is currently the only healthy running back on Miami‚Äôs active roster, though Achane is expected to be ready for Week 1 despite not having practiced since Aug. 16. The team has added a pair of depth backfield options to the practice squad in Jeff Wilson and JaMycal Hasty, but after looking like the Dolphins‚Äô best running back in three consecutive preseason games, Gordon should be the favorite to handle any additional available backfield reps Week 1. If Achane ends up limited in practice leading up to the regular-season opener, it‚Äôs possible Gordon is tasked with a significant workload.</p> <h4 id="jaxson-dart-qb">Jaxson Dart (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Though the Giants had listed him behind Russell Wilson and Jameis Winston on depth charts throughout the preseason, Dart took reps ahead of Winston in all three of New York‚Äôs exhibition contests, with the rookie first-round pick completing 32 of 47 attempts for 372 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions to go with six carries for 52 yards and another score. He now appears to have clinched the No. 2 job heading into Sunday‚Äôs season opener in Washington. While Wilson should start for the Giants as long as he stays healthy and keeps the team competitive, Dart‚Äôs excellent preseason could embolden the coaching staff to make a change if the veteran shows any signs of slippage.</p> <h4 id="chig-okonkwo-te">Chig Okonkwo (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br/> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br/> <strong>Details:</strong> Okonkwo‚Äôs lone catch came on a pass from rookie first overall pick Cameron Ward, who played two drives. Okonkwo appears to be locked in atop Tennessee‚Äôs tight end depth chart, ahead of rookie fourth-round pick Gunnar Helm and last year‚Äôs backup Josh Whyle. Tennessee‚Äôs starters may see more extensive action in the team‚Äôs second preseason game Friday against the Falcons.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_1_2025_TOM_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br/><br/></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_1_2025_TOM_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="team-reports"/><category term="2025-26,"/><category term="WeeklyRecap,"/><category term="Week1"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[weekly team status recap]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Year 2 League Changes</title><link href="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-0/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Year 2 League Changes"/><published>2025-08-26T10:19:38+00:00</published><updated>2025-08-26T10:19:38+00:00</updated><id>https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-0</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://family-fantasy-football.github.io/reports/2025/Week-0/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="important-league-changes-for-2025-season">Important League Changes for 2025 Season</h2> <h3 id="league-expansion">League Expansion</h3> <p><strong>OLD:</strong> 10 teams<br/> <strong>NEW:</strong> 12 teams, welcoming Emma Grau and Christine Hamlin</p> <h3 id="rostering-changes">Rostering Changes</h3> <p><strong>OLD:</strong> 3 WR and 8 BENCH spots <strong>NEW:</strong> 2 WR and 7 BENCH spots</p> <h3 id="waiver-system-overhaul">Waiver System Overhaul</h3> <p><strong>OLD:</strong> First Come, First Serve waivers<br/> <strong>NEW:</strong> FAAB (Free Agent Acquisition Budget) continuous system</p> <ul> <li>Each team receives <strong>$100 budget</strong> for the entire season</li> <li>Bid on players you want - highest bid wins</li> <li>$0 bids <strong>ARE</strong> allowed</li> </ul> <h3 id="quarterback-scoring-changes">Quarterback Scoring Changes</h3> <h4 id="touchdown-passes">Touchdown Passes</h4> <p><strong>OLD:</strong> 4 points per TD<br/> <strong>NEW:</strong> 6 points per TD</p> <h4 id="completion-percentage-new">Completion Percentage (NEW!)</h4> <ul> <li><strong>+0.5 points</strong> for each completion</li> <li><strong>-1.0 points</strong> for each incompletion</li> <li><strong>Break-even point:</strong> 66.7% completion rate</li> </ul> <p><em>Example: 20/30 passing = (20 √ó 0.5) + (10 √ó -1) = 0 points from completion percentage</em></p> <h3 id="tight-end-scoring-boost">Tight End Scoring Boost</h3> <p><strong>OLD:</strong> 0.5 PPR (Half Point Per Reception)<br/> <strong>NEW:</strong> 0.75 PPR</p> <h2 id="questions">Questions?</h2> <p>If you have any questions about these changes, please reach out in the league chat or group message.
