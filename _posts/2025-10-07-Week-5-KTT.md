## Player Report

#### Tyler Allgeier (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Bijan Robinson had a massive day with 21 touches, a career-high 181 scrimmage yards and a rushing TD of his own, but Allgeier still made an impact with a 15-yard score late in the third quarter. It was the fourth-year RB's second touchdown of the season, and despite his backup role he's been able to carve out some fantasy value behind Robinson, turning 41 carries through four weeks into 155 rushing yards. The Falcons will be on bye in Week 5, but Allgeier's volume in Week 6 could depend on whether the team can keep things close against the Bills.
#### David Njoku (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Njoku was Dillon Gabriel's favorite pass catcher, as Njoku led the team in targets, receptions and yards. His biggest contribution was a nine-yard touchdown catch late in the third quarter -- his first of the season -- and he also chipped in an impressive leaping catch just before halftime that went for 17 yards. This was by far Njoku's most productive performance of the season and was a positive first showing with Gabriel.
#### Evan Engram (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Engram finished second in receptions and targets on an afternoon when Bo Nix spread the ball around to nine different pass catchers overall. The veteran tight end also scored his first touchdown in a Broncos uniform on an 11-yard catch just before the halfway point of the fourth quarter, and his receiving yardage total was a new season high. Engram has played a more short-area role than may have initially been expected upon his signing with Denver this offseason, but his upside keeps him a viable consideration at what can be a difficult position for reliable fantasy production.
#### Troy Franklin (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Franklin was a distant second in receiving yards to Courtland Sutton on the afternoon, and he tied for third in targets while recording a two-point conversion following Evan Engram's fourth-quarter touchdown grab. Franklin, Bo Nix's former Oregon teammate, has no fewer than four and as many as nine targets over Denver's first five games, but he's posted 44 receiving yards or fewer in three of those contests. Franklin will likely remain a relatively middling fantasy option in a Week 6 matchup against the Jets in London.
#### Brian Thomas Jr. (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Thomas finished as the Jaguars' leader in receptions, receiving yards and targets, holding the top spot in the middle category for the second consecutive week. His final catch of the night was the most critical, as he recorded a 33-yard grab on Jacksonville's game-winning drive and then drew a pass interference penalty that wiped out an interception four plays later. Thomas' yardage tally was also a new season high for the second-year wideout, who's yet to have his first true breakout effort in head coach Liam Coen's offense but has put together his two best all-around performances this season in the last pair of contests. Thomas will take a 16-244-0 line into a Week 6 home matchup against a Seahawks squad that just conceded a 163-yard, one-touchdown day to the Buccaneers' Emeka Egbuka on Sunday.
#### Isiah Pacheco (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Pacheco excelled on a per-carry basis (5.1 YPC) while garnering the most targets out of the backfield for Kansas City on Monday. That's where the good news ends, as fellow RB Kareem Hunt found the end zone twice on his seven rushing attempts in the loss. Pacheco's fantasy value continues to be doused by the presence of his veteran teammate in an even timeshare, a scenario that should continue repeating itself against the Lions on Sunday.
#### Ladd McConkey (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** McConkey responded well coming off of his worst receiving line as a pro last week (1-11-0), grabbing five receptions and his first touchdown of the 2025 season in a losing effort. The 23-year-old finished behind only Keenan Allen (nine) in targets Sunday, maintaining the former's healthy average of 6.8 targets per game through five weeks. McConkey will attempt to ride the momentum from Sunday's strong fantasy performance into a road tilt against the Dolphins in Week 6.
#### De'Von Achane (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Achane came into the interconference battle with elevated expectations, considering the struggles of the Panthers against the run and the fact Tyreek Hill's (IR, knee) absence was expected to open up even more pass-catching opportunities for the versatile back. The latter partly did come to fruition, as Achane recorded his third-highest reception and target tallies of the season and salvaged his fantasy day with an impressive 10-yard touchdown catch on the first play of the second quarter. However, the speedy back was surprisingly stymied on the ground, leading to a season-low rushing yardage total. Achane's chances of a rebound Week 6 are kind of bleak as well, considering he'll face off with a talented Chargers defense in South Florida.
#### Darius Slayton (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Slayton pulled up lame in the fourth quarter of Sunday's loss to the Saints, and now the Giants have a short week ahead of Thursday night's game against the Eagles. If Slayton is unable to play Week 6, Jalin Hyatt and Beaux Collins figure to see every-down snaps alongside slot man Wan'Dale Robinson, though the Giants could use more two-tight end sets featuring Daniel Bellinger.
#### Wan'Dale Robinson (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Jaxson Dart wasn't able to stretch the field much in his first game working without Malik Nabers (knee), and while tight ends Theo Johnson (6-33-2 on seven targets) and Daniel Bellinger (4-52-0 on four targets) saw more volume than usual, Robinson was able to get his share of those short passes as well. The veteran slot receiver has caught multiple passes in four of five games so far in 2025, posting a 23-267-1 line on 34 targets, and he should continue to have a solid PPR floor given the team's lack of other receiving options. However, Robinson may not have much of a ceiling in a Week 6 clash with the Eagles.
#### Aaron Rodgers (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The Steelers played from ahead for most of the game, so Rodgers attempted only eight passes in the second half. He managed to move the offense efficiently when asked, however, with the key to his day being an explosive 80-yard touchdown to DK Metcalf early in the second quarter. This was a return to form for Rodgers, as he had only a 3:3 TD:INT while combining to throw for 332 yards across his last two games. Pittsburgh is likely to continue to rely on its run game and short passes to move the offense, which will lead to inconsistent fantasy results for Rodgers.
#### Mike Evans (WR)
**Injury Status:** Out <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** out
#### Baker Mayfield (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Mayfield flirted with perfection in a masterful performance that saw him miss just four pass attempts while committing zero turnovers. The 30-year-old was especially sharp in the clutch when he led a pair of five-play drives that took up a little over one minute of game clock to give Tampa Bay the 10 points needed to secure victory. The loss of star WR Mike Evans (hamstring) hasn't hampered Mayfield and the passing offense, as the signal-caller is averaging 334.0 passing yards with a pair of touchdowns in the two games sans Evans. Mayfield will look to build off of the momentum of his cleanest outing when the Buccaneers host the 49ers next Sunday.
#### Tyler Lockett (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** There were some positives to take away from the performance, as Lockett logged a season-high 74 percent of offensive snaps and drew four targets for the second consecutive game. However, he was unable to connect with Cam Ward, who has struggled in his first four starts as a pro. Like nearly every Titans' pass catcher, Lockett is an unreliable fantasy option.
#### Jayden Daniels (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Daniels returned from a two-week absence due to a knee injury in order to lead his team to its third win of the season. The 24-year-old was sporting a brace on his left knee, but it did not appear to limit the quarterback's mobility on any of his eight carries Sunday. Daniels is averaging 221.3 passing yards and 41.3 rushing yards with four touchdowns to no interceptions in three 2025 starts. The dual-threat sophomore could be primed for his finest fantasy outing under the bright lights of Monday Night Football in Week 6 when the Commanders host a Bears defense that is surrendering 389.0 yards of offense to opponents this season.
