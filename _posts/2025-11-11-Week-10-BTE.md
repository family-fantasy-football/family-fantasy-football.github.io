## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 DJ Moore (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Moore and Rome Odunze traded places after Moore led all Bears wide receivers in receiving yards while Odunze went without a catch in the Week 9 win over the Bengals. Prior to Sunday's goose egg, Moore had at least three catches in every game this season. Chicago's wide receiver room has been hit-or-miss with the Bears leaning more on the ground game lately, but Moore will try to get back on track in Week 11 against the Vikings, just as Odunze did against the Giants.
</div>

### 🟢 Tee Higgins (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Higgins was the star of the first three quarters for the Bengals, making a picturesque contested 44-yard touchdown grab along the left sideline with under two minutes remaining in the first half before tacking on a two-yard scoring catch with just over five minutes left in the third quarter. Higgins added his two-point conversion reception following a Noah Fant 23-yard TD catch with under two minutes remaining, and the former has now visited the end zone four times in the last three games. Higgins also has at least 62 receiving yards in three of the last four contests, affording him plenty of momentum going into Cincinnati's Week 10 bye.
</div>

### 🟢 Joe Flacco (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Listed as questionable coming in due to a shoulder injury, Flacco ironically finished the offensive showcase with a career-high passing yardage total that comfortably exceeded his previous best of 389. The veteran quarterback got it done with plenty of efficiency while averaging 10.0 yards per attempt and facilitating 100-yard performances for top wideouts Tee Higgins, who also caught two of Flacco's touchdowns, and Ja'Marr Chase. Flacco appeared to have authored a miraculous comeback with his two final scoring tosses of the day to Noah Fant (23 yards) and Andrei Iosivas (nine yards), but Chicago answered with a 58-yard touchdown by Colston Loveland to escape with the victory. Despite the disappointing outcome Sunday, Flacco has provided a significant spark for Cincinnati's air attack and already has a pair of 300-yard efforts in the four games he's started heading into a Week 11 road matchup against the Steelers on Sunday, Nov. 16 following the Week 10 bye.
</div>

### 🟡 C.J. Stroud (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 J.J. McCarthy (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> McCarthy started the game well, leading the Vikings to an opening-drive touchdown, primarily on the strength of a 62-yard completion to Jalen Nailor. However, it was an up-and-down performance from there, as he turned the ball over twice in three possessions spanning late in the second quarter to early in the third quarter, changing the trajectory of the game. On the other hand, he had three completions of at least 20 yards while also racking up a season-high 48 rushing yards. McCarthy is likely to remain inconsistent considering he has only four career starts, though he has a positive matchup in Week 11 against Chicago.
</div>

### 🟢 Juwan Johnson (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The tight end put together a career-best day in terms of yardage, including a 30-yard touchdown from rookie quarterback Tyler Shough in the fourth quarter, the second straight game in which the duo has connected for a score. Johnson is having a breakout campaign in his sixth NFL season, putting together a 43-491-3 line on 61 targets through 10 games heading into the Saints' bye week.
</div>

### 🟢 Devin Singletary (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Singletary ceded most of the rushing workload to Tyrone Tracy (14 carries for 71 yards), but the former finished with a two-yard advantage in scrimmage yards (73 to 71). Most of Singletary's yardage came on a 41-yard catch on a fourth-quarter pass from Russell Wilson, who came into the game after Jaxson Dart suffered a concussion in the second half. Singletary should continue to platoon with Tracy, but expectations for the Giants' offense would be low if Dart doesn't play in Week 11 against the Packers.
</div>

### 🟢 Breece Hall (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Hall took a screen pass to the house for a 42-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter. The Jets' two longest offensive plays besides that touchdown were runs of 30 and 22 yards by Hall. After having zero touchdowns through seven games, Hall has produced two rushing touchdowns, a receiving score and a touchdown pass across his last two outings. He should continue to lead the Jets' run-heavy offense Thursday against the Patriots.
</div>

### 🟢 Dallas Goedert (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Goedert finished Monday's low-scoring affair as the Eagles' second-leading receiver behind WR DeVonta Smith (4-69-1). It also was Goedert's third-best receiving total in what has been a touchdown-dependent campaign. The 30-year-old currently is sitting on seven touchdowns (a career high) to go along with 34 receptions and 332 yards in eight active games this season. Goedert checks in as a startable tight end in fantasy heading into next Sunday's tilt against Detroit.
</div>

### 🟢 Roman Wilson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Wilson's three targets were his second-highest mark of the season, though nearly the entirety of his production came in garbage time. He caught a pass from Aaron Rodgers over the middle before turning upfield for a 27-yard score with three minutes remaining in a three-score game to tally his second career touchdown. Wilson has shown occasional signs of progress this season, but he remains a peripheral part of the offense.
</div>

### 🟢 Calvin Austin III (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Austin tied DK Metcalf for the team lead in targets, also his highest mark of the season. However, the results didn't follow in a poor offensive showing from the Steelers. Austin had miscues of his own, including a dropped pass that was intercepted midway through the fourth quarter. Austin has earned at least six targets in each of three games since returning from a shoulder injury, though he has only 98 total yards in that span.
</div>

### 🟢 Kendrick Bourne (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Bourne started and logged 43 snaps on offense (68 percent) Sunday, so a lack of playing time can't excuse the putrid fantasy line. The veteran wideout was simply outclassed by the Rams' defensive backs, failing to create separation in a game the 49ers were forced to throw the ball 39 times. After reviving his career with a pair of 142-yard games in Weeks 5 and 6, Bourne has fallen off as a fantasy option in the following weeks, averaging just 2.3 targets per game in those four contests. The 29-year-old's Week 11 value is limited to deeper formats, even in a favorable matchup against the Cardinals next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Jauan Jennings (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jennings was stripped on a first-quarter reception for his first lost fumble of the season. Aside from the hiccup, the veteran starter went on to produce his best receiving line since an impressive showing back in Week 2 (5-89-1). Jennings has been heating up in recent weeks, scoring in consecutive appearances while recording at least four receptions in four straight. Ricky Pearsall (knee) keeps racking up missed games while Brandon Aiyuk (knee) still seems a ways away, so Jennings could continue operating as the 49ers' top receiver against the Cardinals next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Zach Charbonnet (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Charbonnet finished as the Seahawks' leading rusher while matching starter Kenneth Walker (14-67-0) in carries. The 24-year-old Charbonnet did not receive a target for the first time since Week 2 in an odd game script that saw Seattle attempt just 12 passes in a comfortable win. The backup's value has been inflated by six trips to the end zone this season, but his week-to-week production remains volatile, with Sunday being his first game rushing for over 50 yards in eight appearances. Charbonnet is providing enough to be considered a flex option against the Rams next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Kenneth Walker III (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Walker averaged a healthy 4.8 yards per tote Sunday, but his managers might be feeling let down after seeing backups Zach Charbonnet (14-83-1) and George Holani (7-31-1) cash in both of Seattle's rushing scores. The 24-year-old Walker's 120 carries still leads Seattle through nine games, but he has been held out of the end zone since Week 3. Walker is still generating solid rushing totals as the Seahawks' lead back, with managers hoping for a return to his scoring ways against the Rams next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Terry McLaurin (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Out<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> It's another early-week rule out for McLaurin, who doesn't seem to be particularly close to a return in what has turned into a lost season for the Commanders. This could also go down as a lost season for McLaurin, who has appeared in just four games, though he's left a pair of those early with quadriceps issues. Deebo Samuel and Treylon Burks (finger) paced the Washington wide receivers in playing time Week 10 against the Lions, followed by Robbie Chosen, Jaylin Lane and Chris Moore in that order. McLaurin will have the Week 12 bye to try and get ready for a Week 13 date with the Broncos.
