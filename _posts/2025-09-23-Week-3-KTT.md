## Player Report

#### Tyler Allgeier (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** After 26 rushing attempts through the first two weeks, Allgeier's muted role was a product of Sunday's game script, as the Falcons got in an early hole and tried to pass their way out of it. Allgeier is still the top backup behind Bijan Robinson, despite undrafted rookie Nathan Carter getting more touches against Carolina. All of Carter's attempts came on Atlanta's final drive, and he fumbled on his last carry.
#### David Njoku (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Njoku led the Browns across the board in receptions, receiving yards and targets in the narrow upset win. The veteran tight end was productive relative to how quiet a day it was overall for Cleveland's passing attack, and Njoku encouragingly retains a steady role for the time being despite the clear talent and readiness of rookie position mate Harold Fannin. Njoku will take a 12-117-0 line on 18 targets into a Week 4 road matchup against the Lions.
#### Evan Engram (TE)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** questionable
#### Troy Franklin (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Franklin followed up the best performance of his young career against the Colts in Week 2 with an absolute stinker against the Chargers. The 2024 fourth-round selection still finished in a tie for second in team targets with Marvin Mims, but both youngsters paled in comparison to No. 1 wideout Courtland Sutton's monster 6-118-1 receiving line Sunday. Franklin still provides some good upside in a soft matchup against the Bengals next Monday if managers can look past his dud in Week 3.
#### Brian Thomas Jr. (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Thomas endured another lackluster afternoon on a day when Trevor Lawrence continued to struggle with play-to-play consistency. However, the talented second-year wideout still managed to finish second in receiving yards on the afternoon for Jacksonville courtesy of a critical and team-long 46-yard catch with two minutes remaining to set up a game-winning 10-yard touchdown run by Travis Etienne on the next play. While the noteworthy reception propped up Thomas' fantasy day to an extent, he'll still take just a 7-115-1 line on 25 targets through three games into a Week 4 road matchup against the 49ers next Sunday.
#### Isiah Pacheco (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Pacheco was far more efficient with his 10 carries in Sunday's win compared to the paltry 22 rushing yards he managed in Week 2. The positive news ends there, as backup Kareem Hunt also received 10 carries while punching in Kansas City's only rushing touchdown on the evening. It appears a timeshare has developed in the Chiefs' backfield, limiting Pacheco to a flex option at best against the Ravens next Sunday.
#### Rashee Rice (WR)
**Injury Status:** Suspension <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Rice won't be eligible to practice while he remains suspended, but he can take part in meetings and stay involved with the team as he gears up for a return Week 7 versus the Raiders on Oct. 19. The 0-2 Chiefs have solely missed Rice's presence in the first two games of the season, with his absence being further magnified by the loss of fellow receiver Xavier Worthy (shoulder), who will be sidelined for a second straight game Sunday against the Giants after suffering a labrum tear three snaps into Kansas City's Sept. 5 loss to the Chargers.
#### Ladd McConkey (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** McConkey came up with a few critical chain-moving receptions but otherwise was kept in check for a third consecutive week. At this point it certainly seems like Keenan Allen (11 targets) has re-emerged as Justin Herbert's favorite intermediate target, and the blossoming of third-year wide receiver Quentin Johnston into a bona fide option has carved into McConkey's work more. Perhaps backing up some relevant fantasy concerns, the second-year wideout's subpar yardage figure came despite Herbert attempting 47 passes, his most since 2023.
#### De'Von Achane (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** After being held to 2.7 yards per carry by the Patriots in Week 2, Achane bounced back with an efficient effort on the ground that included two double-digit-yardage runs. He also followed up an 8-92-1 receiving line against New England with another busy night as a receiver, albeit in much more of a short-area role. Achane also saw rookie backfield mate Ollie Gordon convert a red-zone carry into a two-yard touchdown in the first quarter and log just three fewer carries, so the division of labor between the two will be worth monitoring in a Week 4 home matchup against the Jets on Monday night, Sept. 29.
#### Darius Slayton (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The Giants couldn't get much going with their passing offense, consistently targeting their top playmakers on deep passes. Slayton was the exception, as he saw the majority of his opportunities in the short areas of the field, with his longest gain going for 14 yards. While Slayton notched a season high in targets and receptions, both Malik Nabers and Wan'Dale Robinson will likely continue to be prioritized ahead of him in the offense.
#### Wan'Dale Robinson (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** The Giants' passing offense never got on track, limiting the production of the entire receiving corps. Robinson wasn't immune, turning in season-worst marks in every statistical category. Many of his targets were tightly contested -- including one that was picked off in double coverage -- and Robinson was hit hard over the middle on his lone catch of the night late in the fourth quarter. Positively, he should continue to maintain a significant role in the offense in Week 4 against the Chargers.
#### Aaron Rodgers (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The veteran QB hit DK Metcalf for a 12-yard score in the second quarter and Calvin Austin with a game-winning 17-yarder with just over two minutes left in the fourth. Rodgers' first touchdown of the afternoon also moved him past Brett Favre into fourth place on the NFL's all-time list, and he finished the game with 510 -- putting him 29 behind Peyton Manning for third place. Rodgers has a 7:3 TD:INT through his first three games as a Steeler, but he faces a tough test in Week 4 in Ireland against the Vikings.
#### Mike Evans (WR)
**Injury Status:** Doubtful <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Evans has been diagnosed with a moderate hamstring strain, according to Jenna Laine of ESPN.com, and she reports Evans will be sidelined three-to-four weeks. Pelissero notes that Evans' latest hamstring injury isn't as severe as the one that cost him four weeks last season. With Evans looking likely to miss Week 4 against the Eagles, first-round rookie Emeka Egbuka figures to vault into the WR1 role for the Bucs. There's also a real chance Chris Godwin (ankle) makes his season debut against Philadelphia. Sterling Shepard should remain in the slot role for Tampa Bay. Tez Johnson and Ryan Miller are next up on the depth chart at wide receiver.
#### Baker Mayfield (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Five Chase McLaughlin field goals and a 55-yard Jamel Dean INT return for a TD accounted for most of Tampa Bay's scoring on the afternoon, but Mayfield did hit Mike Evans for a five-yard strike in the second quarter, giving him a 6:0 TD:INT to begin the season. Evans left the game with a hamstring injury late in the contest, but Chris Godwin (ankle) could be ready to return next week and rookie Emeka Egbuka has already made a significant impact through his first three NFL games, so Mayfield should still have dangerous downfield options available if his veteran No. 1 wideout is sidelined for a Week 4 tilt against the Eagles.
#### Tyler Lockett (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Lockett has maintained a consistent snap rate across three games in Tennessee, playing nearly exactly half of the snaps in every contest. His performance in Sunday's loss was his best of the year, highlighted by a long gain of 16 yards. Elic Ayomanor, Calvin Ridley and Chig Okonkwo are likely to remain prioritized ahead of Lockett in the offense, leaving him with limited upside on a weekly basis.
#### Jayden Daniels (QB)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** questionable
