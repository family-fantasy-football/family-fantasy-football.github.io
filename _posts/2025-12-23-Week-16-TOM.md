## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Jacoby Brissett (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Brissett barely completed 50 percent of his pass attempts in his worst start since taking over for Kyler Murray (foot) back in Week 6. The 27-year-old Brissett recorded his lowest passing yardage total through 10 starts while being held to a single touchdown scored for just the second time this year. Brissett had been a revelation over his previous nine appearances with the Cardinals, so fantasy managers can hold out hope for a bounce-back effort in a soft matchup against Cincinnati in Week 17.
</div>

### 🟢 Marvin Harrison Jr. (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Harrison returned from his second two-game layoff since Week 10 -- the first was due to a concussion -- to reclaim his spot in Arizona's starting lineup. The 22-year-old may have been limited by the nagging heel injury that sidelined him in the first place after finishing Sunday's contest with new single-game lows for receptions (one) and yards (14) this season. Adam Schefter of ESPN shared late Saturday that the Cardinals planned to ease Harrison in upon his return, and that was indeed the case Sunday, as he logged just a 51 percent offensive snap share -- well below the 89 percent share posted by usual No. 2 wideout Michael Wilson. All three of Arizona's top receiving options experienced dips in production against Atlanta in Week 16, so Harrison's dud also may have been the result of a poor matchup for the Cardinals as a whole. Harrison will make another attempt at a return to form -- and may see an increased workload -- in next Sunday's road matchup against the Bengals.
</div>

### 🟢 James Cook III (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Cook has now surpassed 100 rushing yards in back-to-back games, as well as four of his last five appearances. He did much of his damage versus the Browns in the first half, scoring on a highlight-reel 44-yard run early in the first quarter, before finding pay dirt from three yards out late in the second quarter. Cook remains entrenched as the focal point of Buffalo's offense and is locked in as a high-end RB1 for fantasy purposes heading into a home matchup against the Eagles in Week 17. The Bills then will close out the regular season with a favorable home game against the Jets in Week 18.
</div>

### 🟢 Dalton Kincaid (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> One of Josh Allen's top targets was nowhere to be found Sunday, although Kincaid's first blanking of the season came on a day when Allen threw for only 130 yards. Given his typical importance to the air attack, Kincaid's a good bet to bounce back in a Week 17 home matchup against the Eagles.
</div>

### 🟢 Jared Goff (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Goff took to the air a season-high 54 times as the Lions played down by two scores for much of the fourth quarter. He was efficient throughout the contest, and he picked up 199 yards and touchdowns of 27 and four yards across the team's final three drives of the game. While it hasn't led to consistent victories, Goff has topped 300 passing yards in three straight games while also throwing seven touchdowns in that span.
</div>

### 🟡 Romeo Doubs (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The injury appears to have occurred when Doubs attempted to field an onside kick late in the fourth quarter. He wasn't able to do so, and Chicago recovered the ball before subsequently scoring the game-tying touchdown. With Doubs at least temporarily sidelined, Jayden Reed should serve as the Packers' No. 2 wideout, and Dontayvion Wicks and/or Matthew Golden could take on a more prominent role on offense.
</div>

### 🟢 Jayden Higgins (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Higgins' three targets tied for fifth on the team, and the rookie has now managed just two catches for 21 scoreless yards on four targets across the last two contests. Higgins hasn't shown much of a fantasy ceiling in a passing offense that also includes Nico Collins, Dalton Schultz and Christian Kirk. Higgins won't be a recommended fantasy starter next Saturday against the Chargers' tough pass defense.
</div>

### 🟢 Tyler Warren (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Warren tied Josh Downs for the team lead in targets, but he wasn't anywhere near as productive as his teammate. The rookie tight end has now been at 45 receiving yards or fewer in five straight games, a far cry from the 61.7 receiving yards he averaged over his first 10 career contests. Warren has seen 15 targets over his first two games with Philip Rivers, however, affording him upside despite recent struggles in a Week 17 home matchup versus the Jaguars.
</div>

### 🟢 Ashton Jeanty (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jeanty was mired in a three-game slump in which he failed to top 35 rushing yards in each start, but he broke out in impressive fashion by scoring touchdowns as both a runner and receiver Sunday. The 21-year-old accomplished the feat against arguably the league's fiercest defense of 2025, helping push the Texans to the brink of a potential shocking upset. The outburst coincided with the return of starting QB Geno Smith (shoulder/back), but the rookie tailback had been struggling with the veteran signal-caller under center earlier in the schedule. Jeanty will attempt to sprint to the finish line of an inconsistent rookie campaign by taking advantage of a soft matchup against the Giants next Sunday.
</div>

### 🔴 Omarion Hampton (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Hampton got a significant workload after Kimani Vidal left the contest due to a neck injury. Head coach Jim Harbaugh declined to give an update on the status of Vidal, but if he's out next Sunday, Hampton could see another game with significant volume as the Chargers attempt to limit a fearsome Houston pass rush come Week 17. The rookie has double-digit carries in each of the past three weeks since returning from a long-term ankle injury, but he could see a bump in targets too given Hampton had 17 receptions early in the season before the emergence of Vidal.
</div>

### 🟢 Blake Corum (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Corum still logged nine fewer carries than backfield mate Kyren Williams, but he was the only one of the two to get into the end zone. Corum scored his sixth touchdown of the season on a one-yard run in the third quarter directly following an interception of Sam Darnold, and the second-year back logged a career-high carry total. Corum has now recorded double-digit rush attempts in three straight games  and has scored five times over the last four contests, giving him plenty of standalone value going into a Week 17 road matchup against the Falcons on Monday night, Dec. 29.
</div>

### 🟡 Kayshon Boutte (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Boutte was unable to return to this past Sunday's 28-24 win over the Ravens after checking out of the game in the fourth quarter to be evaluated for a head injury. With Boutte now having been diagnosed with a concussion, he could face an uphill battle to clear the five-step protocol in advance of the Patriots' Week 17 game against the Jets. Boutte's potential absence could free up more playing time out wide for rookie Kyle Williams, who had previously seen his largest snap shares of the season in Weeks 10 and 11 while Boutte was sidelined with a hamstring injury.
</div>

### 🟢 Jaxson Dart (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Dart's first completion of the game came with just 1:47 left in the first half. He was 0-for-3 with an interception prior to that point. He continued to struggle as a passer the rest of the way as the Giants fell to 2-13 with the low-scoring loss. The Giants' penultimate game of the regular season will be a Week 17 trip to Las Vegas, which holds significant implications in the race for the first overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. Dart provided some exciting moments earlier in the season, especially with his legs, but he has topped 200 passing yards only twice in his last four starts and may be looking to run less after having been asked to take a more cautious approach down the stretch.
</div>

### 🟢 AJ Barner (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Barner helped spark the Seahawks' second-half rally with a 26-yard touchdown reception with just over six minutes remaining in the fourth quarter. Barner's TD grab snapped a nine-game scoreless drought, and the second-year pro's yardage total was his highest in the last five contests. Barner will look to carry the momentum from his best performance in more than a month over into a Week 17 road matchup against the Panthers on Sunday, Dec. 28.
</div>

### 🟢 Tez Johnson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The rookie's minimal role persisted in Sunday's loss, with Johnson seeing the field on just 25 percent (16 snaps) of the Buccaneers' offensive plays. The recent return of Mike Evans and season debut of Jalen McMillan has predictably pushed Johnson down the depth chart, where he projects to remain for the final two games of the regular season and in the postseason, if Tampa Bay advances.
</div>

### 🟢 Chimere Dike (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The rookie slot receiver and return star scored his third receiving TD in the last five games, and fourth of the season, on a one-yard connection with Cam Ward in the third quarter. Dike has added two punt-return scores to his ledger in 2025, and his 2,269 all-purpose yards through 15 games leads the NFL by a wide margin. Dike will look to pad his totals in Week 17 against the Saints.
</div>

### 🟢 Chris Rodriguez Jr. (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Rodriguez returned from a one-game absence and tied his season high with both 15 carries and 16 touches. He worked in a relatively even split with Jacory Croskey-Merritt for much of the game, though Rodriguez was able to pad his stats in garbage time. Rodriguez recorded four rushing attempts and accounted for 38 yards and his touchdown on Washington's final possession with the team down three scores. The backfield remains fairly ambiguous heading into a Week 17 matchup against the Cowboys, though both Rodriguez and Croskey-Merritt should retain significant roles.
