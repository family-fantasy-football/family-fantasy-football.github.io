## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Bam Knight (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Knight watched teammate Emari Demercado (14-79-0) return from an ankle injury and reclaim the starter's workload out of Arizona's backfield. Head coach Jonathon Gannon stated that he would lean on the hotter hand Monday, and Demercado was that guy on Monday Night Football. Knight still handled a decent amount of touches, so he could retain value in deeper formats in a potential timeshare against the Seahawks on Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Marvin Harrison Jr. (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Harrison entered Monday's primetime tilt facing a team boasting two proven superstar receivers, only to casually finish as the game's leading receiver and top fantasy producer. The seven receptions also represented a new career high for the 22-year-old. Harrison's big night upped his season line to 31-492-3 through eight starts, giving managers hope for strong second half to his sophomore campaign. Even in games in which Harrison doesn't go off, he is providing enough of a floor to earn a spot in fantasy lineups against the Seahawks on Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Dalton Kincaid (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Sunday's production tied Kincaid's previous season highs in targets and receptions from a six-catch, 108-yard outing against the Patriots in Week 5. The 25-year-old was able to tack on his fourth receiving touchdown of the season in the win over the Chiefs, culminating in his finest fantasy performance to date in 2025. Kincaid upped his season line to 27-411-4 through seven appearances, with a couple of low-usage games holding him back from a true breakout season. Kincaid will look to carry the momentum from Sunday's showing into a road matchup against the Dolphins in Week 10.
</div>

### 🟢 James Cook III (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Cook set a new high-water mark for touches in a single game this season (28) while finishing with a game-high 125 yards from scrimmage. The talented rusher did all of the heavy lifting for the Bills between the 20s, allowing for backup Ty Johnson and QB Josh Allen to hit pay dirt on the ground Sunday. Cook entered Sunday's contest averaging a touchdown scored per game this season, so managers will have to live with "just" another 100-yard performance (his fifth on the year). Look for Cook to potentially get back into the scoring column against the Dolphins next Sunday after torching Miami's defense for 108 yards and a touchdown when these two teams met back in Week 3.
</div>

### 🟢 J.K. Dobbins (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The veteran back led the Broncos in rushing on the afternoon, but he once again saw rookie RJ Harvey deliver a big play, this time a 27-yard TD reception from Bo Nix early in the fourth quarter that sparked a comeback. Dobbins has gone four straight games without a score of his own, putting a cap on his fantasy value, but he's still produced 695 rushing yards and four touchdowns through his first nine games with Denver. Dobbins should be busy again in Week 10 against the Raiders.
</div>

### 🟢 Jared Goff (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Lions' offense wasn't as efficient as usual, but Goff still finished with a fantasy-friendly stat line while working around five sacks. The veteran signal-caller facilitated a pair of 97-yard efforts for Sam LaPorta and Amon-Ra St. Brown, and he connected with LaPorta and Jameson Williams for scoring tosses of 40 and 37 yards, respectively. Goff's yardage total was his second highest of the season, and he's now thrown multiple touchdown passes in four of the last five games heading into a Week 10 road matchup against the Commanders.
</div>

### 🟡 Matthew Golden (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Before exiting the game in the third quarter, Golden was on the field for 24 snaps and finished with two catches for nine yards on three targets. While he appears to have avoided a serious injury, his availability for the Packers' Week 10 matchup with the Eagles next Monday will be determined by his practice activity. The Packers will return to the field Thursday for their first session of the week.
</div>

### 🟢 Romeo Doubs (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The fourth-year wideout was Jordan Love's top option, leading the Packers in catches and receiving yards on the afternoon while seeing double-digit targets for the first time in 2025. Doubs sports a 34-441-4 line on 52 targets on the season, and he saw his competition for looks get thinned significantly in the second half of Sunday's loss, as Tucker Kraft (knee) and Matthew Golden (shoulder) both left the game and didn't return. If they remain sidelined in Week 10, Doubs is likely to get elevated target volume again versus the Eagles.
</div>

### 🟢 Tyler Warren (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Warren saw a normal amount of opportunity in the loss, though that was less impressive considering Daniel Jones took to the air 50 times. The bigger problem was Warren's lack of downfield targets, as his longest gain went for only nine yards. That led to the lowest yardage output of Warren's impressive rookie season, though he's still earned at least four receptions in all but one game on the campaign.
</div>

### 🟢 Travis Hunter (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Injured Reserve<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> After Hunter was listed as a limited participant Thursday with a knee injury, coach Liam Coen told Demetrius Harvey of The Florida Times-Union on Friday morning that it was non-contact in nature and would result in an IR stint, per Harvey. Adam Schefter of ESPN then reported Friday afternoon that initial tests on Hunter's knee revealed that the ACL was intact, but he'll be evaluated further to determine the extent of the damage, which won't be known until next week. For the time being, Hunter will miss at least the next four games following this transaction, and the Jaguars will be rolling with Brian Thomas, Parker Washington, Dyami Brown and Tim Patrick (groin) at wide receiver moving forward.
</div>

### 🟢 Ashton Jeanty (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jeanty used the Raiders' bye week to rebound nicely from his worst game as a pro against Kansas City in Week 7, nabbing his third touchdown reception of the year in Sunday's narrow defeat. The Boise State product still finished with a per-carry average below four yards for the third consecutive contest running behind Las Vegas' shoddy offensive line, but his contributions as a receiver balanced out a nice fantasy score in the end. Jeanty will have to work for another strong outing in Week 10 against Denver's top-10 rush defense on Thursday Night Football.
</div>

### 🔴 Omarion Hampton (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Injured Reserve<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Though Hampton is eligible to resume practicing in Week 10, the rookie running back hasn't made enough progress in his recovery from an ankle injury for the Chargers to open up his 21-day evaluation window. Hampton looks set to remain sidelined for at least three more weeks, with his earliest potential return date coming Sunday, Nov. 30 against the Raiders. Los Angeles is expected to proceed with Kimani Vidal and Jaret Patterson as its main options out of the backfield for at least the next two games.
</div>

### 🟡 Kayshon Boutte (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Boutte played just 18 of the Patriots' 68 snaps on offense and finished with no catches on one target before being forced out of this past Sunday's 24-23 win over the Falcons due to a hamstring injury. If Boutte is unable to practice in some capacity by Friday, he'll likely be in line to miss his first game of the season. According to Evan Lazar of the Patriots' official site, Vrabel specifically noted that Kyle Williams -- who played 46 percent of snaps Week 9 -- would get more opportunities if Boutte ends up sitting out against the Buccaneers.
</div>

### 🟢 Tyler Shough (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Shough turned in a quiet performance in another dreadful outing for the Saints' offense. New Orleans played from behind in stops and starts for essentially the entire game, as the Rams dominated time of possession 43:53-16:07. Shough showed some promise when he piloted a six-play, 71-yard touchdown drive at the end of the first half, but he had only three offensive series in the second half, including a final possession that ended with a fourth-down interception. Shough and the Saints' offense will need to make some significant improvements before their first matchup versus the division-rival Panthers in Week 10 next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Jaxson Dart (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Dart connected with Theo Johnson for a 15-yard touchdown on the opening drive but generated only 65 passing yards on 15 first-half passes. The Giants finally got back into the end zone with less than eight minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, when Dart scored his fifth rushing touchdown through six starts on a six-yard designed run. Dart also tossed a 24-yard touchdown pass to Gunner Olszewski with 1:21 remaining, but the Giants still faced double-digit deficits after both of those fourth-quarter scores. The rookie first-round pick led the team in rushing yards Sunday as he continues to generate offense with both his arm and legs, but Dart's limited supporting cast will continue to cap his upside in Week 10 against the Bears.
</div>

### 🟢 AJ Barner (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Barner took a direct snap in the third quarter and plowed into the end zone to extend the Seahawks' lead to 38-7. The second-year tight end continues to operate as the clear No. 1 on the depth chart ahead of rookie Elijah Arroyo, as Barner played 43 of 51 offensive snaps (84 percent) and finished tied for second on the team in targets. He's scored five touchdowns through eight games, but has averaged just 29.5 receiving yards per game.
</div>

### 🟢 Chimere Dike (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Dike had been breaking out as a receiver in recent weeks, but he showcased his overall playmaking ability in Sunday's loss. He returned a punt 67 yards for a touchdown late in the first quarter, bouncing off a few tacklers before streaking down the right sideline into the end zone. Dike otherwise took a disappointing step back as a pass catcher, as this marked his first game without multiple catches since Week 4.
