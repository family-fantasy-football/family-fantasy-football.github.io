## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Trey McBride (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The fourth-year tight end hasn't missed a beat with Jacoby Brissett under center instead of Kyler Murray (foot). McBride hauled in scores of 15 yards in the second quarter and 12 yards in the third, and through two games working with Brissett, he's delivered an 18-146-3 line on 24 targets as Arizona's clear No. 1 downfield option. With the Cardinals on bye Week 8, Murray could get enough time to recover, but no matter who he's catching passes from, McBride could be poised for another impressive performance Week 9 against the Cowboys.
</div>

### 🟢 Chuba Hubbard (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Hubbard notably out-touched backfield mate Rico Dowdle by a 12-8 margin on the ground, and although the latter was the more efficient of the two by far, Hubbard was the only one of the two to get into the end zone. The fifth-year pro's three-yard scoring run early in the fourth quarter marked his first time in the paint this season, and the two backs may continue working in a fairly close timeshare during a Week 9 road matchup against the Packers next Sunday afternoon.
</div>

### 🟢 Kyle Monangai (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Monangai has between 16 and 24 rushing yards in three of his last four contests, with an 81-yard effort and a touchdown in Week 7. His current workload keeps him a fantasy reserve unless opportunities expand.
</div>

### 🟢 Ja'Marr Chase (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> After setting a franchise record with 23 targets in the Week 7 win over Pittsburgh, Chase continued to see heavy volume from Joe Flacco, though a Jets secondary missing Sauce Gardner (concussion) did a surprisingly decent job of keeping Chase in check. Chase's fantasy managers won't be too disappointed with this outing, especially in PPR formats, though the Bengals will be kicking themselves for getting outscored 23-7 in the fourth quarter by a previously winless Jets team. Given how frequently Flacco looks his way, Chase has returned to the elite echelon of fantasy wide receivers ahead of a Week 9 home game versus the Bears.
</div>

### 🟢 David Montgomery (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jahmyr Gibbs went off for 218 yards from scrimmage and two touchdowns on Monday Night Football, leaving scraps for Montgomery's fantasy managers in Week 7. The latter still received 15 touches, highlighting his continued involvement in Detroit's two-pronged backfield. Both talented rushers have recorded a game with 100-plus yards this season, with Gibbs having the edge in total yards (+269) and touchdowns (+3). Montgomery may not be as tantalizing an asset as Gibbs, but he should continue providing flex value in fantasy when the Lions resume play Week 9.
</div>

### 🟢 Dalton Schultz (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The veteran tight end was coming off a season-best 9-98-0 receiving line on 10 targets versus the Seahawks on Monday night, but even with top two receivers Nico Collins (concussion) and Christian Kirk (hamstring) both sidelined, he was unable to build upon that production. Schultz downturn was surprising in that context, as he finished with season lows in receptions, receiving yards and targets. Schultz will look to bounce back in Week 9 against a tough Broncos defense, and he could once again play without at least one of his two injured wide receiver teammates.
</div>

### 🟢 Jaylin Noel (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Noel finished tied for the team lead in receptions and for runner-up status in targets while also finishing second in receiving yards. It was the second straight productive showing in less than a week for the rookie third-round pick, who'd also produced a career-best 77 receiving yards on four catches during the Week 7 Monday night loss to the Seahawks. The absences of Nico Collins (concussion) and Christian Kirk (hamstring) have both played a part in Noel's recent surge -- Collins exited early in the fourth quarter in Seattle while Kirk has missed the last two games -- but Noel could be carving out a larger role for himself that will endure even when his veteran teammates are back in action. Noel also reclaimed his duty on special teams as a punt returner following a one-week hiatus when Braxton Berrios handled that chore.
</div>

### 🟢 Josh Downs (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Downs returned from a one-game layoff after clearing the league's concussion protocol to reclaim a starting role in Indianapolis' receiver rotation. The 23-year-old picked up where he left off when he scored his first touchdown of the season in his last appearance against the Cardinals in Week 6. Downs will attempt to hit pay dirt for the third time in as many appearances when the Colts visit the Steelers next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Travis Etienne Jr. (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> While the fourth-year back was effective with his touches, Etienne got phased out of the game plan in the second half after the Jaguars fell behind 21-0 before halftime. Heading into the team's Week 8 bye, Etienne sports an impressive 594 scrimmage yards and three total TDs through seven contests.
</div>

### 🟢 Matthew Stafford (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Puka Nacua's (ankle) absence likely created concerns for Stafford's managers heading into Sunday's overseas tilt against an up-and-coming Jacksonville defense. The veteran signal-caller proved that no Puka was no problem, hooking up with his other superstar, wideout Davante Adams, in the end zone thrice en route to a record-setting day. Stafford's five touchdown passes set a new single-game record for the NFL's International Series, which officially started back in 2007. The 37-year-old will enter the Rams' bye week completing 67 percent of his passes for 1,866 yards and 17 touchdowns to just two interceptions in seven starts for Los Angeles.
</div>

### 🟢 Rhamondre Stevenson (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The fifth-year back saw rookie TreVeyon Henderson gain 75 yards on just 10 totes, while Stevenson struggled to 2.4 yards per carry. The veteran has managed to hang onto the top spot in New England's backfield time share so far this season, but Henderson's explosiveness may be tipping the scales in his favor. That said, Stevenson had three rushing TDs over the prior three games, and he likely won't disappear from the offense completely even if Henderson takes the lead role in Week 9 against the Falcons.
</div>

### 🟢 Spencer Rattler (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Rattler was benched for rookie second-rounder Tyler Shough late in the third quarter of New Orleans' 23-3 loss to the Buccaneers in Week 8, though neither signal-caller had much success moving the ball on offense. Moore will likely want to give whomever of Rattler or Shough will start Sunday against Los Angeles a full week of practice, so a decision on the team's No. 1 quarterback for Week 9 likely will arrive prior to Wednesday. Neither boasts much fantasy appeal, especially in single-QB formats.
</div>

### 🟢 A.J. Brown (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Out<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> out
</div>

### 🟢 Cooper Kupp (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Seahawks tried to get cute in the second quarter with a wide receiver pass play that resulted in an interception for Kupp. Depending on league settings, the veteran wideout's rare turnover may have erased more than half of his fantasy production Monday. Only getting one target is the more concerning takeaway after Kupp scored his first touchdown as a member of the Seahawks in Week 6. The 32-year-old will carry a 24-293-1 receiving line into Seattle's upcoming bye week before resuming play against the Commanders on Nov. 2.
