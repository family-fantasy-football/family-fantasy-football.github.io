## Player Report

#### Michael Carter (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Carter was expected to step into an expanded role with both James Conner (foot) and Trey Benson (knee) sidelined, though it was unclear exactly how touches would be distributed. Carter resoundingly served as the lead back for Arizona, accounting for 23 total touches, while Emari Demercado and Bam Knight combined for nine. He wasn't particularly efficient with the touches, though he did manage to find the end zone on a one-yard plunge early in the first quarter. Carter's involvement as a receiver was also particularly notable, as Demercado was projected to take over duties as the primary pass catcher out of the backfield. Carter looks to have reliable volume heading into a Week 6 matchup against the Colts, though this situation could remain fluid.
#### Lamar Jackson (QB)
**Injury Status:** Out <br>
**Lineup Slot:** IR <br>
**Details:** Glazer's dispatch essentially matches what Brian Wacker of The Baltimore Sun reported Tuesday, when he noted that the two-time league MVP would be facing an estimated 2-to-3-week recovery timeline from the hamstring injury he sustained in last Sunday's loss to the Chiefs. Though the Ravens appear set to wait and see how Jackson progresses in his recovery over the next several days before deciding on his status for the matchup with the Rams, the team is on bye Week 7, which could incentivize Baltimore to hold him out until then to give him added time to heal up. Cooper Rush will step in for Jackson as the Ravens' starting quarterback against the Texans.
#### Dillon Gabriel (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Gabriel drew his first NFL start in a tough situation, traveling overseas to London while facing one of the more intricate defenses in the league. He handled himself well, as he didn't turn the ball over and was sacked only twice. While Gabriel primarily worked in the short areas of the field, he did manage a pair of completions of more than 20 yards and led two lengthy touchdown drives. There will still be plenty of chatter about the quarterback situation in Cleveland, but Gabriel made a positive first impression as the team's starter.
#### Quinshon Judkins (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Judkins' takeover of the Cleveland backfield continued, as he accounted for 23 of 29 rush attempts by running backs. Even with plenty of attention from the Minnesota defense, Judkins ripped off long runs of 32,14 and 14 yards on the ground to top 100 rushing yards in a game for the first time in his career. Jerome Ford and Dylan Sampson will take away some opportunities as a pass catcher, but Judkins has a reliable workload and has been very effective through four games as a pro.
#### Jameson Williams (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Williams was coming off an eight-target performance in Week 4, but he had very limited involvement in Sunday's blowout victory. Both of his touches came on Detroit's first two drives of the game. While Jared Goff only took to the air 23 times to limit opportunities across the board, Williams has five or fewer targets in all but one game so far this season.
#### Nico Collins (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** It was a solid day for Collins, highlighted by long gains of 24 and 14 yards as well as a 10-yard touchdown. However, he finished third on the team in receiving yards and was out-targeted by Dalton Schultz. That was likely affected by game script -- C.J. Stroud attempted only 10 passes in the second half and was benched for most of the fourth quarter -- but Collins has now seen six or fewer targets and recorded under 55 receiving yards in three of five games this season. His three touchdowns have covered up some of that lack of volume, but Collins hasn't put up the big reception or target totals expected entering the season.
#### Jonathan Taylor (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Taylor encountered plenty of resistance from the Raiders defense on many of his runs, but he found enough running room to record scoring rushes of three, one and six yards, as well as a game-long 16-yard scamper. It was Taylor's second three-touchdown tally of the season, a two-game sample that accounts for all his end-zone trips to date. The sixth-year pro remains the component around which the Colts' prolific offense revolves, and Taylor should be very busy once again in a Week 6 home interconference clash with the Cardinals next Sunday.
#### Brock Bowers (TE)
**Injury Status:** Out <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Bowers was unable to play through the PCL injury in Week 5 against the Colts, and it seems the Raiders are finally considering letting their star tight end recover and get close to 100 percent after he played through the injury the first four weeks of the season. Bowers is genuinely looking questionable for Sunday's Week 6 bout with the Titans. If Bowers is unable to play, Michael Mayer (concussion) would likely handle starter-level snaps, as long as Mayer is able to clear the concussion protocol after missing the past two games.
#### Tua Tagovailoa (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Tagovailoa managed well in his first game without Tyreek Hill (IR, knee), focusing a majority of his attention, as expected, on the trio of Jaylen Waddle, Darren Waller and De'Von Achane. The three pass catchers were responsible for Tagovailoa's three TD tosses and 17 of his completions overall. The 2020 first-round pick has multiple touchdown passes in four straight games -- and Sunday's tally was a season high -- but with Miami at 1-4, the overall long-term outlook for the Dolphins is bleak. A Week 6 home matchup against the Chargers could be an uphill battle for the short-handed offensive unit as well, even when factoring in Los Angeles' struggles against the Commanders in Week 5.
#### Jaylen Waddle (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** In his first full game this season without Tyreek Hill (IR, knee) alongside him, Waddle stepped up as expected and led the Dolphins across the board in receptions, receiving yards and targets. The talented veteran had another couple of close calls downfield that could have resulted in an even bigger day, but as it was, Waddle posted new season highs in catches, receiving yards and targets. He also recorded his third touchdown of the season on a go-ahead 46-yard grab with just under five minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, making it a productive all-around day despite the disappointing team outcome. Waddle will aim to put together a successful encore performance in a tough Week 6 home matchup against the Chargers next Sunday afternoon.
#### Jordan Addison (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Kevin Seifert of ESPN.com reported Addison was subject to a first-quarter benching for undisclosed reasons, but the third-year wideout ultimately would make up for lost time in clutch fashion. Addison was efficient with his opportunities, and the bulk of those came at the tail end of the Vikings' game-winning drive late in the fourth quarter. Addison was on the receiving end of each of Carson Wentz's final three completions and totaled 21 yards on those catches, the last which was a go-ahead 12-yard touchdown grab. For his part, Addison conceded afterward that he wasn't sure if he'd even be able to play in the game, per Seifert, but he made good on his vow to be ready if he did step on the field. Following the completion of his season-opening three-game suspension, Addison has immediately played a key part in Minnesota's air attack with a 9-155-1 line on 14 targets over his first two contests. He'll now prepare to play his first 2025 game stateside following the Week 6 bye when the Vikings host the Eagles on Sunday, Oct. 19 in a contest that could also provide Addison his first regular-season opportunity to work with J.J. McCarthy (ankle) as his quarterback.
#### Jordan Mason (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Mason's rushing opportunities were limited, but he locked in a solid fantasy day with a three-yard touchdown run to cap off the first drive of the second half. The offseason addition generally found tough sledding on the ground outside of the short score and his game-long 14-yard run, but he continued to keep Minnesota's ground attack viable in the ongoing absence of Aaron Jones (IR, hamstring). Mason should be in line to remain the lead back when the Vikings come out of the Week 6 bye with a Week 7 home matchup against the Eagles on Sunday, Oct. 19.
#### Mason Taylor (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The rookie tight end led the Jets in catches and targets and was only four yards back of Garrett Wilson for the team lead in that category as well. Taylor is blossoming now that he's put an early-season ankle issue behind him, and over the last three games he's delivered an 18-150-0 line on 25 targets as he begins to establish himself as the team's No. 2 pass-catching option behind Wilson. Taylor will look for his first career touchdown in Week 6 against the Broncos.
#### Garrett Wilson (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Rookie tight end Mason Taylor actually led the Jets in targets with 12 and catches with nine, but Wilson once again paced the team in receiving yards and was on the other end of Justin Fields' second TD toss of the afternoon on New York's final possession. While he has yet to hit 100 yards in a game this season, Wilson will take an impressive 33-382-4 line on 48 targets into a Week 6 tilt with Patrick Surtain and the Broncos' stingy secondary.
#### Jaylen Warren (RB)
**Injury Status:** Out <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Warren missed the Steelers' Week 4 game against the Vikings in Ireland and had the Week 5 bye to recover. Pittsburgh isn't required to release an official practice report until Wednesday this week, but Warren's presence on the field Monday would indicate he's closing in on being 100 percent and returning to game action ahead of Sunday's date with the Browns.
#### Jauan Jennings (WR)
**Injury Status:** Out <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** out
#### Tyjae Spears (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Spears was activated from injured reserve and able to suit up for the first time in 2025 after recovering from an ankle injury. He unsurprisingly worked as the clear backup to Tony Pollard, managing a pair of five-yard gains on his four carries. Spears could see his role expand as the season progresses.
