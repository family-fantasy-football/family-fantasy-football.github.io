## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Khalil Shakir (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Bills' wideouts had even less to do than usual during a cold, snowy game in Buffalo, but Shakir managed to make an impact with an 11-yard TD grab from Josh Allen in the second quarter. It was Shakir's fourth TD of the season, tying his career high, but it was also the third time in the last four games the fourth-year WR failed to reach 20 receiving yards. Shakir will will hope for better playing conditions and more volume in Week 15 against the Patriots.
</div>

### 🟢 Harold Fannin Jr. (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Fannin played an integral role in Shedeur Sanders' career-best performance, leading the Browns in receptions, receiving yards and targets with figures that also all qualified as season highs. Fannin's score, his fourth of the season, came on an impressive seven-yard catch late in the fourth quarter for the final points of the afternoon, and he now has at least six receptions on four occasions during his productive rookie campaign. Fannin will take a 59-619-4 line on 85 targets into a Week 15 road matchup against the Bears next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Jake Ferguson (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The talented tight end finished a distant third in receiving yards for the Cowboys on the night, but Ferguson turned in another productive performance he rounded out with his one scoring grab. Ferguson now has three consecutive five-catch efforts and at least 50 receiving yards in three of the last five contests heading into a Week 15 home matchup against the Vikings on Sunday night, Dec. 14.
</div>

### 🟢 George Pickens (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> It was a largely forgettable night for Pickens, who somehow finished with his lowest yardage total since Week 1 on a night when Dak Prescott threw for a season-high 376 yards on 47 pass attempts and CeeDee Lamb left the game early in the second half due to a concussion. Pickens did reach the five-catch threshold for the sixth straight game, but he also had a ball bounce off his hands on the first play of the second half that resulted in a Lions interception. Pickens also appeared to have a chance to come down with a deep throw from Prescott just before the two-minute warning but never appeared to make an attempt to catch the ball, and he'd been flagged for a facemask penalty earlier in the contest as well to wipe out a reception. Naturally, the good has far outweighed the bad when it comes to Pickens' debut Cowboys campaign, but he'll need to bounce back in a Week 15 home matchup against the Vikings on Sunday night, Dec. 14, especially if Lamb remains out.
</div>

### 🟢 Jahmyr Gibbs (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Gibbs accrued more production through the air, finishing with his second-highest reception and receiving yardage totals of the season. However, the 2023 first-round pick found the end zone a season-high number of times on the ground by recording rush TDs of one, 10 and 13 yards, with the latter two scores coming during the second half of the final quarter. Gibbs also contributed a trio of double-digit gains on his seven catches, and he'll naturally continue to profile as an elite option for a Week 15 road showdown against the Rams on Sunday, Dec. 14.
</div>

### 🟢 Woody Marks (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Marks was already well on his way to taking over the Houston backfield, but he had the chance to handle the entire workload after Nick Chubb suffered an injury to his ribs early in the second quarter. While it was an inefficient showing against a tough defense, Marks topped 20 carries for the first time in his rookie campaign, helping him reach at least 60 rushing yards for the fifth time in his last seven games. He also made the most of his work as a pass catcher, recording a nine-yard touchdown reception early in the second quarter. Marks missed out on the chance for an additional score after he was forced off the field due to an injury midway through the fourth quarter, giving Dare Ogunbwale a goal-line carry. While Marks hasn't been overly efficient, he has earned at least 16 carries in each of his last four games, and his role would only become more secure if Chubb is forced to miss additional time.
</div>

### 🟢 Daniel Jones (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Out<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The quarterback will miss the remainder of the 2025 season and is slated to undergo surgery within the next week, per Steichen. Sixth-round rookie Riley Leonard, who replaced Jones Sunday, is also dealing with a knee injury of his own, James Boyd of The Athletic reports. While Steichen thinks Leonard will be able to play in Week 15 against the Seahawks, that's not a lock to happen. With Anthony Richardson (orbital fracture) still on IR and not in line to be activated this week, practice squad member Brett Rypien could end up drawing the start instead of Leonard. In his first campaign with Indianapolis, Jones had been re-establishing himself as a viable QB1, throwing for 3,101 yards with a 19:8 TD in 13 games to go along with 45 carries for 164 yards and five rushing TDs. The 28-year-old is facing a lengthy rehab, and considering that he's on track to become a free agent this offseason, his future with the Colts is uncertain.
</div>

### 🟢 Michael Pittman Jr. (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Pittman had been on the wrong end of the target distribution among Colts' pass catchers in recent weeks, but he rebounded to lead the team in opportunity in Week 14. He was targeted primarily in short areas of the field by Riley Leonard, leading to a modest yardage total, though he did manage a long 24-yard catch shortly after halftime. Pittman nearly had an even bigger day, as he appeared to have a 16-yard touchdown that was ultimately nullified by a borderline pass interference call. While this was an encouraging performance, Pittman could struggle down the stretch with Daniel Jones (Achilles) out for the rest of the year.
</div>

### 🟢 Bhayshul Tuten (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Tuten also briefly exited the contest to be evaluated for a concussion but was cleared to retake the field. The rookie fourth-round pick lost a fumble shortly after returning to action, however, and didn't play another offensive snap the rest of the day. The two offensive touches were a season low for Tuten, who will need better ball security in order to maintain a regular role in the offense. Travis Etienne remains Jacksonville's clear No. 1 tailback, and LeQuint Allen is now better positioned to compete for the backup job.
</div>

### 🟢 Justin Herbert (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Los Angeles' meager offensive line predictably struggled against Philadelphia's diabolical pass rush, and as such it seemed like Herbert was running for his life all evening. The feat was obviously more impressive considering the Pro Bowl quarterback just had surgery to repair a fracture in his left hand a week prior, but the near constant duress didn't allow for any gaudy fantasy figures. It's hard to envision that looking significantly better against the Chiefs next week, who will be trying to keep their playoff hopes alive.
</div>

### 🟢 Tre' Harris (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Harris' four targets were third on the team, trailing Ladd McConkey (six) and Keenan Allen (five), as Harris saw one more target than Quentin Johnston. On a day Justin Herbert (hand) threw for just 151 yards on 20 attempts, McConkey was the team's leading receiving with just 39 yards. Second-round rookie Harris has secured 19 of 24 targets for 167 yards and one touchdown through 12 games. He's a situational WR4 for Los Angeles and would only have serious fantasy appeal if one of McConkey, Allen or Johnston went down with an injury.
</div>

### 🟢 Davante Adams (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Adams suffered his worst fantasy output of the season in Week 14 as the Cardinals keyed in defensively on the touchdown machine. The 32-year-old's scoring streak of six games (featuring 11 touchdowns) finally came to end after QB Matthew Stafford spread the wealth to Los Angeles' other receiving options Sunday. Co-starter Puka Nacua shined with a 7-167-2 receiving line, leaving little work for Adams in the second half of the lopsided blowout. Adams will look to get back to his scoring ways when the Rams host the Lions for a potential offensive showdown in Week 15.
</div>

### 🟢 T.J. Hockenson (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> While the veteran tight end didn't see much volume, Hockenson did haul in his first TD since Week 9 and third of the season on a two-yard toss from J.J. McCarthy in the fourth quarter. All three of McCarthy's career-high three touchdowns went to TEs, an encouraging sign for Hockenson in what has been a tough season overall. He'll look to reach 60 receiving yards for the first time in 2025 in a Week 15 clash with the Cowboys.
</div>

### 🟢 Drake Maye (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> About the only blemish on Maye's final line was the three sacks he took from the Giants' highly aggressive front, as the second-year signal-caller otherwise was in command from start to finish. He helped stake the Patriots to a 30-7 halftime lead with three- and 33-yard touchdown passes to Kayshon Boutte and Kyle Williams, respectively. Maye didn't have to do much in the second half, but he still netted the third-most passing yards in a game of his career. Maye now has thrown for at least 270 yards in four consecutive contests heading into a Week 15 home showdown against the Bills on Sunday, Dec. 14 following a Week 14 bye.
</div>

### 🟡 Alvin Kamara (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 Ricky Pearsall (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> High winds in Cleveland nerfed both passing attacks, and tight ends George Kittle and Harold Fannin ended up being the leading pass catchers for their respective squads. Pearsall hasn't been able to make much of an impact even in better conditions since returning from a knee injury however, and over the last three games he's managed just a 5-20-0 line on nine targets. The second-year wideout will get the 49ers' bye week to reset before taking on the Titans in Week 15.
