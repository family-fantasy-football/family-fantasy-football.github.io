## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 DJ Moore (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Just five days following a two-touchdown effort against the Steelers, Moore was virtually a non-factor in Friday's upset victory. Moore has topped out at two catches and 18 receiving yards in three of his last four games, making his 5-64-2 line versus Pittsburgh in Week 12 an outlier within that stretch. Caleb Williams' inconsistencies certainly don't help the veteran receiver's cause, but he figures to at least draw plenty of targets in a critical Week 14 road clash against the Packers on Sunday, Dec. 7.
</div>

### 🟢 Tee Higgins (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Out<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Higgins was concussed eight days ago in the Bengals' Week 12 loss to the Patriots and missed last Thursday night's win over the Ravens. He has six more days to get ready for next Sunday's game against the Bills. If Higgins can't get cleared, Andrei Iosivas and Mitchell Tinsley should again see increased reps alongside Ja'Marr Chase.
</div>

### 🟢 C.J. Stroud (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Stroud made his return from a three-game absence due to a concussion and looked very sharp despite the multi-game layoff, finishing with his second-highest passing yardage total of the season. He spread the ball around effectively to six different targets, and after rookie Jayden Higgins had built up plenty of momentum while working with Davis Mills in the previous three games, Stroud helped extend his strong stretch of play by connecting with him on five occasions for 65 yards. Now back to full health for the stretch run, Stroud figures to be busy once again in a Week 14 road showdown against the Chiefs next Sunday night.
</div>

### 🟢 Juwan Johnson (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Johnson logged over eight targets for the first time since Week 2 and led the team in this category ahead of wideouts Devaughn Vele (eight) and Chris Olave (seven). The tight end finished with a decent outing by his standard, as he's now averaging 4.5 receptions and 48.0 receiving yards per game across 12 outings. In four games with rookie QB Tyler Shough starting under center, Johnson has accumulated an 18-208-2 stat line. He should remain as one of the Saints' top three targets when they next play versus Tampa Bay in Week 14.
</div>

### 🟢 Tyler Shough (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Shough aired it out again after logging 43 passing attempts in the Week 12 loss to Atlanta. The rookie QB was under fire in the pocket, taking four sacks, including one where he was stripped of the ball. Shough had an additional interception that didn't count on his official stat sheet, as it occurred on a two-point conversion attempt that was returned for two points the other way by Miami safety Minkah Fitzpatrick in the fourth quarter. Shough also didn't have the support of a consistent rushing attack with Alvin Kamara out after suffering an MCL sprain last week. Across four starts, he has completed 68.1 percent of his passes for 235 yards per game and a 5:3 TD:INT. New Orleans will next play on the road against the Buccaneers in Week 14.
</div>

### 🟢 Devin Singletary (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Singletary made his mark on Monday Night Football when he lined up in the Wildcat formation and ripped off a 22-yard score on the first play of the fourth quarter. The 27-year-old finished as the game's leading rusher a week after being overshadowed by backfield mate Tyrone Tracy. The latter finished with 33 net yards on 11 touches Monday, but Tracy also left the game in the fourth quarter with a hip injury and didn't return. Singletary has quietly entered the mix as a flex option in standard fantasy formats after recording double-digit carries in three straight games while hitting pay dirt thrice over that span, but if Tracy misses any time, the former would increase his value further. The Giants will be on a bye next week and resume play against the Commanders on Sunday, Dec. 14 in Week 15.
</div>

### 🟢 Breece Hall (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Hall capitalized on a muffed punt by Atlanta in the second quarter with a two-yard touchdown run on the next play. His third rushing touchdown of the season opened the scoring, and after losing their previous 10 games when scoring first, the Jets avoided tying a dubious NFL record by avoiding an 11th such loss. Hall got all 19 of the carries among Jets running backs in the win, and his versatile skill set should earn him another heavy workload in Week 14 against a Dolphins defense that has struggled to stop the run.
</div>

### 🟢 Dallas Goedert (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Eagles' passing game was stalled for much of the game, leading to another relatively quiet performance for Goedert. His primary contribution came on a 22-yard catch in garbage time, but A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith otherwise overshadowed him. Goedert now has fewer than 30 receiving yards in five of his last six games and is very dependent on reaching the end zone to be a viable fantasy contributor.
</div>

### 🟢 Roman Wilson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Wilson had double-digit receiving yards in five of six appearances following the Steelers' Week 5 bye, but he's failed to secure any of his four targets over the past two games. Over his 12 appearances this season, Wilson has secured 12 of 21 targets for 166 yards and two touchdowns.
</div>

### 🟢 Calvin Austin III (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Austin has had limited production for most of the season, but Sunday's Week 13 loss marked the first time this year that he was held without a catch. Across 10 appearances this year, he's secured 26 of 44 targets for 278 yards and two touchdowns.
</div>

### 🟢 Kendrick Bourne (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Bourne was targeted for the first time since Week 10 in Sunday's road victory, but he failed to haul in his only opportunity across 23 snaps played on offense (34 percent). The veteran wideout has been relegated to No. 4 on the depth chart ever since Ricky Pearsall returned from a knee injury Week 11. Bourne should remain a fantasy afterthought when the 49ers return from the upcoming bye week to face the Titans on Sunday, Dec. 14.
</div>

### 🟢 Jauan Jennings (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Both passing attacks struggled to deal with high winds in Cleveland, but Jennings was able to get on the other end of a Brock Purdy seven-yard TD pass in the fourth quarter. It's the fifth-year wideout's fourth score in the last five games, a stretch in which Jennings has put together a 23-246-4 line on 33 targets. He'll get a chance to rest during next week's bye before the 49ers host the Titans in Week 15.
</div>

### 🟢 Zach Charbonnet (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Charbonnet took full advantage of the lopsided nature of Sunday's contest, accruing six of his 14 carries -- including the touchdown run -- as Seattle was burning clock in the fourth quarter. It was the 24-year-old's eighth rushing touchdown of the season, matching the career-best mark he posted across 17 games as a sophomore. Unlike last year, Charbonnet has experienced a dip in efficiency as a rusher (-0.7 YPC) while seeing his role as a pass-catcher evaporate in 2025 (nine receptions in 11 appearances). Those factors cap Charbonnet as a flex option in fantasy for next Sunday's road tilt against Atlanta.
</div>

### 🟢 Kenneth Walker III (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Walker showed no ill effects from the glute injury that limited him during the practice week, finishing as the team's leading rusher and steamrolling DB Isaiah Rodgers on a second-half carry for good measure. Zach Charbonnet (14-52-1) did vulture a touchdown from Seattle's starter, but a significant portion of the backup's work came in garbage time of the shutout victory. Walker continues to be a consistent runner in fantasy, recording at least 50 rushing yards in eight of his 12 starts this season. The 24-year-old has just one rushing touchdown since Week 3, so Walker's fantasy managers are hoping for more work around the goal line against the Falcons next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Terry McLaurin (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> McLaurin accounted for his normal snap count in a game for the first time since Week 2 and was on the field for the first time since Week 8. Even without Jayden Daniels (elbow) under center, McLaurin showed no signs of rust by leading the team in targets while logging three catches of more than 15 yards to record his highest yardage total in five contests this season. McLaurin also found the end zone in overtime, beating the Denver defense on a short slant over the middle from three yards away. While the Commanders came up short, McLaurin had a successful return and seemed to provide a boost to the entire unit.
