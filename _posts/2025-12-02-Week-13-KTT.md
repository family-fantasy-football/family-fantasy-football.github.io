## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Bam Knight (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Knight was the clear lead back with Emari Demercado (ankle) sidelined, and the 24-year-old put together a season-high yardage total while logging double-digit carries for the second straight game and fifth time in the last seven contests overall. Knight also averaged a season-high 5.6 yards per carry, and he recorded the first receiving touchdown of his career on a 15-yard grab during a broken play late in the third quarter. As Jess Root of USA Today notes, Knight didn't see the field after the 10:46 mark in the fourth quarter, though that may have been a byproduct of Arizona favoring their passing-down personnel featuring Michael Carter in the backfield. Knight had been nursing a knee injury coming into Sunday, so his practice activity may be worth keeping an eye on during Week 14 prep. Even if his knee doesn't prove to be a concern, Knight could still be in line for a lightened workload next Sunday versus the Rams if Trey Benson (knee) is cleared to return from injured reserve.
</div>

### 🟢 Tyler Allgeier (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Allgeier scored a one-yard touchdown one play after Bijan Robinson was stopped for no gain. Robinson got a rushing score in the third quarter, but Allgeier still leads the team with eight rushing touchdowns compared to Robinson's five. Allgeier maintains some fantasy value thanks to his goal-line usage, but he's averaging just 28.7 rushing yards per game heading into a Week 14 home game against Seattle's elite run defense.
</div>

### 🟢 David Njoku (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Njoku has taken a clear back seat to rookie TE Harold Fannin in recent weeks, and Fannin actually paced the Browns in targets (five), catches (three) and yards (43) against San Francisco while securing a 34-yard touchdown from Shedeur Sanders. Njoku isn't much more than waiver-wire fodder outside of deep fantasy leagues.
</div>

### 🟢 Evan Engram (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Engram made his mark in the extra period when he ripped off a 41-yard gain that helped set up the game-winning score from teammate RJ Harvey. The 79 yards represented a new single-game high from the veteran tight end through 11 appearances with Denver in 2025. Had this game ended in regulation, Engram would have finished with a stat line closer to the 3.2 receptions and 26.0 yards he averaged heading into Sunday Night Football. Fantasy managers should not overreact to this standout performance and continue to treat Engram as a deep-league option for next Sunday's tilt against Las Vegas.
</div>

### 🟢 Brian Thomas Jr. (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Thomas returned from a three-game absence caused by an ankle injury, but his disappointing season continued. The Jaguars were able to rely relatively heavily on their run game while playing with at least a two-score lead for most of the game, but Thomas still finished tied for third on the team in targets. While he converted receptions of 17 and 11 yards, Thomas has now been held below 50 receiving yards in five of his nine games on the campaign.
</div>

### 🟢 Rashee Rice (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> It's the second two-TD performance in six games this season for Rice, who hauled in the first and last of Patrick Mahomes' four touchdown passes on the afternoon. The 12 targets also tied Rice's season high, and he'll take an impressive 42-486-5 line on 59 targets into a tough Week 14 clash with the Texans.
</div>

### 🟢 Isiah Pacheco (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> After missing the prior three games due to a knee injury, Pacheco was back in action but found himself firmly behind Kareem Hunt in the backfield pecking order, as the veteran turned 15 touches into 80 yards from scrimmage. Hunt's recent success appears to have solidified his spot at the top of the depth chart, and Pacheco -- who has yet to reach 60 rushing yards in any game this season -- will likely struggle to make an impact on limited volume Week 14 against the Texans.
</div>

### 🟢 Ladd McConkey (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> McConkey led the team in targets in a game in which the Raiders' pitiful offense rarely threatened the Chargers. More notable was the injury to Justin Herbert in the first half, which will require surgery Monday on his non-throwing handle to stabilize a fracture. Herbert played through the injury Sunday with noticeable padding protecting the left hand, and both coach Jim Harbaugh and the quarterback himself believe he could play Week 14. McConkey's fantasy value will obviously be impacted by Herbert's availability, but regardless the second-year wide receiver has failed to record more than six targets in any of the past four games largely due to negative game scripts.
</div>

### 🟢 De'Von Achane (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Achane finished with his second-highest rushing yardage total of the campaign with the help of three double-digit-yardage runs, including a 29-yard scoring scamper to cap off the opening possession of the contest. Achane's rushing volume has unsurprisingly ticked up over the course of the season as the Dolphins manage the absence of Tyreek Hill (IR, knee), and the explosive back now has three straight games with 21 or more carries heading into a Week 14 road matchup against the Jets.
</div>

### 🟢 Darius Slayton (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Slayton wound up being the beneficiary of Jaxson Dart's (concussion) only touchdown strike in the rookie signal-caller's return to action Monday night. The 28-year-old Slayton finished well behind fellow starter Wan'Dale Robinson and TE Theo Johnson in terms of targets (eight apiece), so fantasy managers shouldn't overreact to the former's first trip to the end zone in 2025. The Giants will be on a bye in Week 14, with Slayton profiling as only a deep-league option in fantasy when the team resumes play on Dec. 14.
</div>

### 🟢 Wan'Dale Robinson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Robinson finished in a tie with TE Theo Johnson for the team lead in targets in QB Jaxson Dart's (concussion) return to action Monday. The 24-year-old Robinson was dealing with an injury of his own during the practice week, but he avoided a designation and the minor ankle issue didn't limit New York's No. 1 receiver in the loss. Robinson recorded at least seven receptions for the fourth time this season (after generating a career-high 93 receptions in 2024) as he continues to put in work for managers in PPR leagues. Robinson will look to add to a current high-water mark of 828 receiving yards when the Giants return from its Week 14 bye to face the Commanders on Dec. 14.
</div>

### 🟢 Tyrod Taylor (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Taylor threw for only 37 yards on 10 first-half passes but connected with Adonai Mitchell for a 52-yard touchdown in the third quarter to tie the score at 14-14. With the Jets trailing 24-17 in the fourth quarter, Taylor led a 15-play, 65-yard touchdown drive, which he capped with a game-tying 10-yard touchdown run with 1:53 remaining. Taylor then led the Jets into range for Nick Folk's game-winning 56-yard field goal on the final play. After notching his first win in three starts this season, Taylor figures to remain atop the depth chart in Week 14 against the Dolphins.
</div>

### 🟢 Mike Evans (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Injured Reserve<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Evans is eligible to come off injured reserve at any moment, but it doesn't sound like a return to game action is in the cards for Week 14 against the Saints. Bowles said Monday that both Evans and Jalen McMillan (neck) "have a little ways to go before playing," according to Rick Stroud of the Tampa Bay Times. Tampa Bay hosts New Orleans next Sunday before then having a quick Week 15 turnaround ahead of a date with the Falcons on Thursday, Dec. 11. Perhaps a Week 16 return versus Carolina would make the most sense for both wideouts.
</div>

### 🟢 Baker Mayfield (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Mayfield was able to manage effectively despite playing with a left shoulder support following his injury against the Rams last Sunday night, avoiding turnovers and completing passes to nine different targets overall. He also saw Chris Godwin commit a rare drop on a perfectly thrown would-be touchdown pass in the first half, but he did just enough overall to keep Tampa Bay ahead of a feisty Jacoby Brissett-led offense on the other side. Mayfield's two-yard touchdown toss to left tackle Tristan Wirfs late in the first half also extended the veteran signal-caller's streak of games with a TD pass to four, and he'll look for an even more productive performance with presumably better health in a Week 14 home matchup against the Saints.
</div>

### 🟢 Jayden Daniels (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Out<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> out
