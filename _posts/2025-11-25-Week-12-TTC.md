## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Bryce Young (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Young was coming off a career-best day in an overtime win over the Falcons in Week 11, but he experienced some significant regression Monday night. The 2023 first overall pick couldn't make many inroads against what had been a vulnerable 49ers defense, save for a 29-yard scoring strike late in the third quarter, and he finished with multiple interceptions for the first time since Week 1. While neither pick directly led to San Francisco points, the second came with 2:54 remaining at the 49ers' 22-yard line and essentially snuffed out any hopes of a Carolina comeback. Young will aim to bounce back in a Week 13 home matchup against the Rams on Sunday, but that shapes up on paper as a more daunting matchup than the one he came up short in Monday night.
</div>

### 🟢 Rico Dowdle (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Game script significantly limited Dowdle's opportunities on the ground, but the talented back still found his way to a highly efficient performance that saw him pace the Panthers in both rushing and receiving yards. Dowdle's carry total was his lowest since Week 1 when he opened the season stuck in a complementary role behind Chuba Hubbard, but his modest volume Monday was strictly an outlier Dowdle should have a chance to bounce back from to some degree in a Week 13 home matchup against the Rams on Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Chase Brown (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The 130 scrimmage yards were a season high for Brown, who ran for at least 100 yards for the second time in 11 games and recorded at least 100 scrimmage yards for the fifth straight contest. The third-year back has piled up 424 rushing yards and 150 receiving yards during that hot streak while scoring two TDs, one on the ground and one through the air. Brown and the entire Bengals offense could get a boost in Week 13 if Joe Burrow (toe) is able to return for a Thanksgiving game against the Ravens.
</div>

### 🟢 Jerry Jeudy (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jeudy's three targets from Shedeur Sanders tied for third on the team behind Harold Fannin's six. Jeudy secured just one of his three looks, and it went for a season-long 39-yard gain, but Jeudy lost a fumble at the end of the play after the ball was punched out from behind. The 2025 season has been a struggle for Jeudy, who has yet to hit 80 receiving yards in a game and has just one touchdown. Jeudy will face an injury-riddled leaky San Francisco defense in Week 13, but Cleveland's offense has been bad enough that Jeudy still isn't an exciting fantasy target in that matchup.
</div>

### 🟢 CeeDee Lamb (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Lamb led the Cowboys in targets, though he was outpaced in every other statistic by George Pickens. Positively, Lamb recorded a 48-yard catch late in the third quarter that helped set up a key touchdown as Dallas came back from a three-score deficit. However, much like his performance in Week 1 against the Eagles, Lamb's performance was defined by a few uncharacteristic drops. While Lamb has only one 100-yard performance in five games since returning from an ankle sprain, he has at least 66 receiving yards in every contest in that span.
</div>

### 🟢 Dak Prescott (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Prescott turned in his most efficient performance of the season, completing three passes of more than 40 yards and seven of at least 20 yards. He continued to show excellent rapport with George Pickens, and the duo capped off the Cowboys' first scoring drive with a one-yard touchdown connection. Prescott accounted for two additional scores in the second half, including an eight-yard rushing touchdown early in the fourth quarter to tie the game at 21-21. He now has seven total touchdowns combined across his last two games while throwing for 250 yards or more in five of his last six matchups.
</div>

### 🟢 RJ Harvey (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> With J.K. Dobbins (foot) done for the rest of the regular season, Harvey stepped into the top spot in the Broncos' backfield for the first time but failed to make much of an impact. Jaleel McLaughlin also vultured a four-yard TD in the third quarter that  might have made Harvey's performance a little more palatable for fantasy investors. The rookie heads into a Week 12 bye with 439 scrimmage yards and six total touchdowns (two on the ground, four through the air) in his first 11 NFL games.
</div>

### 🟡 Brock Wright (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Wright played 88 percent of offensive snaps during Detroit's overtime win over the Giants in Week 12, securing three of four targets for 29 yards, but his status for Thursday's matchup against the Packers now appears uncertain due to a neck injury. It's possible the Lions are simply being cautious with Wright's health on a short week, given his position as the team's de facto starting tight end with Sam LaPorta (back) looking unlikely to return this season. Wright will have two more chances to get on the practice field ahead of Thursday's primetime divisional matchup.
</div>

### 🟢 Brenton Strange (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Strange made a triumphant return from a five-game injury absence, finishing as Jacksonville's leading receiver with a season-high 93 yards in a thrilling overtime victory. The 24-year-old was averaging 4.8 receptions and 45.5 yards in four games prior to going down in Week 5, so it was a great sign for fantasy managers to see their tight end maintain a large role on offense following his lengthy layoff. With a clean bill of health and the starting job intact, Strange checks in as a startable option in most formats for next Sunday's tilt against the Titans.
</div>

### 🟡 Xavier Worthy (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Worthy continues to manage an ankle issue, but the wideout was able to log a 77 percent snap share in Sunday's 23-20 overtime win over the Colts, while catching four of his eight targets for 59 yards in the contest. With no reported setbacks, his listed limitations Monday were presumably maintenance-related. Worthy now has two more chances to log a full practice listing before Kansas City's Week 13 injury designations are posted ahead of Thursday's game against the Cowboys.
</div>

### 🟢 Patrick Mahomes (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The yardage total was a season high as Mahomes led a fourth-quarter comeback from a 20-9 deficit, but Kareem Hunt had Kansas City's only TD while Harrison Butker booted five field goals. Mahomes has a concerning 1:3 TD:INT over the last three games, but Sunday's win could be the spark the team needed to turn things around. He'll likely need to be more productive in Week 13 for a Thanksgiving tilt against the Cowboys.
</div>

### 🟢 Stefon Diggs (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Quarterback Drake Maye focused most of his attention on veteran tight end Hunter Henry, who erupted for a 7-115-1 line on 10 targets, while Diggs' two catches actually tied for the team lead among Patriots' wideouts. The three targets also tied for his season low, but Diggs has still caught multiple passes in every game this season, en route a 61-679-3 line on 75 targets through 12 contests. He'll look to bounce back in Week 13 against the Giants.
</div>

### 🟢 TreVeyon Henderson (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Rhamondre Stevenson returned from a three-game absence due to a toe injury, but that didn't have a big impact on Henderson's workload, as his 18 carries were just one short of his volume from the week before. Stevenson was also largely ineffective on his limited touches, gaining just five rushing yards on six totes and getting stuffed on two carries from Cincinnati's one-yard line in the third quarter. Henderson appears to have the No. 1 job in the backfield firmly in hand, racking up 405 rushing yards and four TDs with 5.4 yards per carry over the last five games while chipping in a 13-81-1 line on 16 targets. Henderson gets a very juicy matchup in Week 13 against a Giants defense that just got torched for 264 scrimmage yards and three total TDs by the Lions' Jahmyr Gibbs.
</div>

### 🟢 Tyrone Tracy Jr. (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Tracy had six more rushing attempts than Devin Singletary, and Singletary wasn't targeted while Tracy contributed catches of 42, 20 and six yards. The Giants will likely continue to mix both running backs in against the stout New England run defense in Week 13, but Tracy has established himself as the 1A backfield option with 269 scrimmage yards over the past two games. Tracy still has only one touchdown this season.
</div>

### 🟢 Mason Taylor (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Taylor didn't see a significant change in production as the Jets benched Justin Fields in favor of Tyrod Taylor (no relation to Mason) at quarterback. Tyrod will likely remain the starter against the Falcons in Week 13. The Jets' rookie tight end has recorded at least three catches in four of the past five games, and that stretch includes Taylor's lone touchdown catch.
</div>

### 🔴 Bucky Irving (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 Sean Tucker (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Bucky Irving (shoulder) remained inactive, leaving Tucker and Rachaad White to split work out of Tampa Bay's backfield. Tucker led the way with 13 touches as compared to eight for White, though White was surprisingly the more efficient back. Tucker did manage decent gains of seven and nine yards early in the game, but he couldn't come close to replicating his impressive Week 11 showing. Reports suggest that Irving has a chance to return in Week 13 against Arizona, which would send Tucker back to a reserve role.
