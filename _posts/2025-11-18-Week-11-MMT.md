## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Khalil Shakir (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Shakir had no part in Josh Allen's breakout performance, which included 317 passing yards and three scoring tosses. The Bills' No. 1 receiver endured the worst game of his career given the negative yardage, and the downturn was particularly alarming when considering Shakir had produced a 20-189-1 line on 24 targets over the previous three games. The fourth-year pro will have an immediate yet challenging opportunity to put the forgettable day behind him, as the Bills travel to the face the Texans on Thursday night to kick off Week 12.
</div>

### 🟢 Harold Fannin Jr. (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Fannin continues to be limited during the practice week with a lingering hamstring issue, but it has not cost the tight end any game action while he continues to play through it. The third-round rookie still finished ahead of veteran starter David Njoku in production Sunday, with the latter being held to one catch for seven yards on two targets. The status of starting quarterback Dillon Gabriel (concussion) is currently unclear for Week 11, but Fannin should continue providing deep-league value no matter which rookie signal-caller is under center against the Raiders next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Jake Ferguson (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> George Pickens and CeeDee Lamb dominated targets, leaving Ferguson with limited opportunity that came exclusively in short areas of the field. That led to Ferguson's second-lowest yardage output of the season, and he now has fewer than 30 receiving yards in three of four games since Lamb returned from an ankle sprain. Positively, Ferguson did find the end zone on a five-yard reception to save his fantasy performance, while also marking his seventh touchdown of the season.
</div>

### 🟢 George Pickens (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Pickens was sidelined for the opening possession of Monday's win for disciplinary reasons, per Clarence Hill Jr. of AllDLLS.com, though that didn't slow him down. He had a determined effort thereafter, showcasing his athleticism and tackle-breaking ability with long catches of 37, 21, 19 and 17 yards -- the longest of which went for a touchdown. This marked Pickens' third 100-yard effort of the season, and he now has at least 75 receiving yards in five consecutive contests.
</div>

### 🟢 Jahmyr Gibbs (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Lions' offense struggled in the loss, with Gibbs being one of the few bright spots. He accounted for five of Detroit's 10 longest gains from scrimmage, including long receptions of 42, 33 and 17 yards, marking the first time he topped 100 receiving yards in his career. Gibbs was less efficient on the ground, though he's still topped 100 rushing yards in two of his last four matchups. He remains one of the best fantasy backs in the league due to his ability to affect the game in multiple ways.
</div>

### 🟢 Woody Marks (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Marks surprisingly found running room hard to come by against what had been a very generous Titans defense. However, the good news for Marks' fantasy managers was the fact he finally operated as the clear lead option over Nick Chubb, who garnered only three carries. Sunday's results not withstanding, Marks has an encouraging outlook for a Week 12 Thursday night home matchup against the Bills' porous front seven.
</div>

### 🟢 Michael Pittman Jr. (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Tyler Warren and Alec Pierce served as Daniel Jones' top two targets Sunday, leaving Pittman in an unfamiliar tertiary role. The veteran's yardage total was a season-low figure, as was his target tally, but the quiet performance can very comfortably be labeled an outlier considering Pittman's typical body of work. Pittman should be in line for a much busier afternoon in a Week 12 road showdown against the Chiefs following a Week 11 bye.
</div>

### 🟢 Daniel Jones (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jones turned in one of the efficient efforts he's regularly managed in Shane Steichen's quarterback-friendly system, but ball security was a significant issue against an aggressive Falcons defense that sacked him seven times. Nevertheless, Jones persevered with the help of Jonathan Taylor's 244-yard, three-touchdown effort on the ground, while the veteran quarterback focused heavily on Tyler Warren and Alec Pierce when dropping back, and the latter was on the receiving end of Jones' one scoring toss from 37 yards out in the first quarter. Jones' one lost fumble, which came early in the third quarter, didn't lead to any Falcons points, and he'll head into the Week 11 bye ahead of a Week 12 road showdown against the Chiefs with 2,659 passing yards, 143 rushing yards and 20 total touchdowns.
</div>

### 🟡 Bhayshul Tuten (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Before his departure from the contest, Tuten carried 15 times for 74 yards and a TD, while working in tandem with Travis Etienne. While he's sidelined, LeQuint Allen is available to handle added RB snaps versus Los Angeles.
</div>

### 🟢 Tre' Harris (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Harris played his usual snap load, but with Los Angeles' offense in disarray and Jacksonville wholly dominating the line of scrimmage, the rookie never stood a chance from a fantasy perspective. The 2025 second-round pick has just nine targets in the last five games after seeing five total in Week 6 despite a typical cadence in terms of playing time.
</div>

### 🟢 Justin Herbert (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The sixth-year pro put together a performance that was about as poor as his numbers indicated, with Herbert finishing with a career-low yardage total. Herbert was sacked just twice but appeared to be under constant duress, and he failed to throw a touchdown pass for the first time all season before being pulled for Trey Lance in the fourth quarter. The Chargers will now have a Week 12 bye to regroup before returning to action in a Week 13 home matchup against the Raiders on Sunday, Nov. 30.
</div>

### 🟢 Davante Adams (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Adams suited up after getting banged up in the fourth quarter of the Rams' previous game, and he secured his league-leading 10th touchdown catch on a one-yard pass in the first quarter against the Seahawks. That was his only reception of the game as Matthew Stafford threw for just 130 yards. The veteran wide receiver's chemistry with Stafford in goal-line situations has been on full display during Adams' four-game, seven-touchdown streak. Adams will try to extend his scoring streak in Week 12 against a Buccaneers defense that just allowed 44 points to the Bills.
</div>

### 🟢 T.J. Hockenson (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> There were some encouraging signs for Hockenson as the Vikings offense used him more in short routes over the middle that were lacking in quarterback J.J. McCarthy's previous starts. However, McCarthy and the passing game struggled overall, which limits Hockenson's upside. McCarthy was just 16-of-32 passing as he struggled with accuracy and had two interceptions.
</div>

### 🟢 Alvin Kamara (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The veteran RB topped 100 scrimmage yards for the first time since Week 2, snapping a string of five straight games in which he didn't even reach 40 rushing yards. Kamara is still looking for his first TD since Week 1, but it was still an encouraging sign, as was the fact that rookie quarterback Tyler Shough got the passing game going. Kamara will get a breather during next week's bye before taking on the Falcons in Week 12.
</div>

### 🟢 Ricky Pearsall (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Pearsall returned to the starting lineup after missing the 49ers' last five contests with a right knee injury. That's where the positive news ends after the sophomore wideout failed to gain a yard with his only touch Sunday. Jauan Jennings (5-54-0) was the only other wide receiver to finish with more targets than Pearsall, so the latter's lack of involvement was likely due to an unfavorable game script. QB Brock Purdy did take a deep shot at Pearsall on one of the duo's two missed connections, and the wideout showed his usual burst down the field despite the good defensive coverage. Pearsall averaged 5.0 receptions and 81.8 yards in the four games he appeared in prior to getting injured, so there is hope for improved results against the Panthers next Monday.
