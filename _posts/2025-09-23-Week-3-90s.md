## Player Report

#### Isaiah Likely (TE)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** questionable
#### Lamar Jackson (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Jackson's stat line was practically pristine, with the two-time MVP finishing the night boasting a 148.1 QB rating. However, Jackson wasn't able to help the Ravens keep pace with an aggressive Lions offense that successfully converted two fourth-quarter fourth-down opportunities. Jackson did pad his numbers somewhat on Baltimore's last drive, a possession he capped off with a 27-yard touchdown pass to Mark Andrews, his second of the night to the veteran tight end. Jackson also connected with Rashod Bateman for a three-yard scoring strike just before halftime, and he'll head into a Week 4 road showdown against Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs with a stellar 9:0 TD:INT through his first three games of 2025.
#### Joe Flacco (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** As his final numbers indicate, Flacco didn't play particularly well, finishing with under 200 passing yards for the second straight game while also failing to throw at least one touchdown pass for the first time this season. Flacco did spread the ball around effectively to eight different pass catchers, although David Njoku's 40 receiving yards qualified as a team-high figure. The veteran signal-caller did complete a key eight-yard pass to Njoku on Cleveland's final drive to set up Andre Szmyt's game-winning field goal, and Flacco will continue under center in a challenging Week 4 road matchup against the Lions next Sunday afternoon.
#### Quinshon Judkins (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Logging his first official NFL start, Judkins set the tone for his second productive performance in as many career games with a seven-yard gain on the Browns' first play from scrimmage. The rookie second-round pick would go on to add a game-long 38-yard run shortly before the halfway point of the fourth quarter, and he then powered in for a one-yard touchdown later in the period that erased a 10-3 deficit. Judkins already looks like a bona fide No. 1 back, and he could see his workload bump up a notch following another week of practice ahead of a Week 4 road matchup against the Lions.
#### Jameson Williams (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Williams garnered a season-low three targets in a contest where the passing offense took a back seat to monster rushing performances from Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery. The 24-year-old Williams managed to break off a couple of chunk plays on his two grabs, but the end result was mediocre from a fantasy perspective without a trip to the end zone. Williams is averaging a massive 21.8 yards per reception this season, so there's upside available for those who can stomach the lows that come with a boom-or-bust asset. The Lions will prepare to host a tough Cleveland defense Sunday.
#### Nico Collins (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** The big-bodied receiver was able to persevere through a ragged overall day for Houston's air attack, finishing as the Texans' leader in receptions, receiving yards and targets. Collins also found the end zone for the second time in as many games when he recorded a 50-yard touchdown grab on what appeared to be a blown coverage by Jacksonville in the fourth quarter. However, he also committed a critical fumble at the Jaguars' 21-yard line with just under four minutes remaining following a 10-yard catch, leading to Jacksonville's game-winning touchdown. Collins will take a 14-181-2 line on 25 targets into a Week 4 home date against the Titans next Sunday.
#### Jonathan Taylor (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Despite his final line, the Titans did a good job of limiting Taylor for much of the game. He punched in a pair of scores from one yard away in the first and fourth quarters. Taylor also broke the contest open and accounted for a significant portion of his yardage with an impressive 46-yard touchdown late in the third quarter, during which he broke through several tackles and evaded additional defenders with a spin move.  Taylor now has four total touchdowns on the season and has topped 100 rushing yards in consecutive contests.
#### Brock Bowers (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** The second-year tight end had a second straight quiet performance after picking up a minor knee injury in Week 1. Despite lacking the explosiveness that led to a record-setting rookie season, Bowers has still remained a big part of the Raiders' passing game and has at least four catches in three straight contests, leading to a 14-179-0 line on 21 targets. With the knee issue further behind him, Bowers could roar back to life in Week 4 against a Bears defense that has been one of the worst units in the NFL to begin the year.
#### Jaylen Waddle (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Waddle went into pregame warmups uncertain to play due to a shoulder issue, but he finished tied with Tyreek Hill for first in receptions among the Dolphins' wideouts. Like his teammate, Waddle also got into the end zone, scoring on a three-yard grab just before halftime to erase a 14-7 deficit. Waddle has at least four receptions in each of the Dolphins' first three games and now has scored in two straight, but he's averaging just 9.8 yards per catch heading into a Week 4 Monday night home divisional clash against the Jets on Sept. 29.
#### Tua Tagovailoa (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Tagovailoa didn't come close to following up his 315-yard tally from Sunday's loss to the Patriots, although he did manage to throw multiple touchdown passes for the second straight contest. He connected with Jaylen Waddle (three yards) and Tyreek Hill (five yards) for his pair of scoring tosses Thursday, but his interception on what appeared to be a poor read at the Bills' 17-yard line with just over three minutes remaining ended up being the decisive play in Miami's third loss in as many games to open 2025. The 2020 first-round pick now has thrown for under 150 yards in two of the first three games of the season while also tossing at least one pick in each contest, depressing his fantasy stock heading into a Week 4 home matchup against the Jets on Monday night, Sept. 29.
#### Jordan Addison (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Addison was suspended for the first three games of the 2025 regular season for violating the league's Substances of Abuse Policy, but the 2023 first-rounder is now poised to return to action this weekend against the Steelers. The wideout thus is on track to resume practicing this week and should have an immediate opportunity to reclaim his key role in a Minnesota WR corps led by Justin Jefferson. Addison's looming return figures to impact the fantasy upside of Jalen Nailor and Adam Thielen but will provide a boost to a passing attack that was helmed by QB Carson Wentz in Week 3 and likely will be for at least another week. In 15 regular-season games last year, Addison logged a 63-875-9 line on 99 targets.
#### Jordan Mason (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Making his first start in place of Aaron Jones (IR, hamstring), Mason delivered on lofty expectations from fantasy managers with an ultra-efficient performance. The offseason addition consistently rattled off productive gains throughout the afternoon, and he found the end zone from five and four yards out in the second and third quarter, respectively. Mason shared work with Zavier Scott (eight carries) and Cam Akers (five carries), but that was at least partly a byproduct of the Vikings being able to rest starters in the second half. Mason will remain a coveted option in all formats when Minnesota faces off with the Steelers in Dublin, Ireland in Week 4.
#### Garrett Wilson (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Despite having Tyrod Taylor under center instead of Justin Fields (concussion), Wilson was still the clear top downfield option for the Jets, as none of his teammates saw more than six targets or caught more than four passes, and his 11-yard TD catch from Taylor early in the fourth quarter kicked off an attempted comeback from a 23-6 deficit by New York. Wilson will take a 21-229-2 line on 30 targets into a Week 4 meeting with the Dolphins.
#### Calvin Austin III (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The third-year wideout hauled in a 17-yard toss from Aaron Rodgers with a little over two minutes left in the fourth quarter to break a 14-14 tie. Austin has quickly earned the veteran QB's trust, and after scoring five TDs in 34 games through his first two NFL seasons, he already has two in the first three contests of 2025, part of an 8-126-2 line on 15 targets. Austin will look to stay productive in Week 4 against the Vikings.
#### Jaylen Warren (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** The fourth-year running back caught multiple passes for the third straight game to begin the season, with the five grabs and six targets both being season highs. Warren was denied a much bigger fantasy performance when Kenneth Gainwell vultured a one-yard rushing TD in the first quarter, however. Warren has racked up 274 scrimmage yards so far as the Steelers' unquestioned lead back, and he'll look to continue his PPR prowess in Week 4 against the Vikings.
#### Jauan Jennings (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** questionable
