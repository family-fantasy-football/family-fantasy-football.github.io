## Player Report

#### Bryce Young (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The Panthers were gifted several short fields early in Sunday's win and also had a pick-six to begin the second half. That limited what was required of Young, as he was able to primarily work in short areas of the field and focus on taking care of the ball. Young did manage to salvage some fantasy value with a four-yard scramble into the end zone midway through the first quarter, but he has now thrown for 155 or fewer yards with one or fewer total touchdowns in two of three games to begin the campaign.
#### Chase Brown (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Brown's final rushing line tells the tale of both limited opportunities due to game script and next to no running room against a talented Vikings front seven. The third-year back's rush attempts and rushing yardage totals were unsurprisingly season-low figures, and Brown could only very modestly make up for the shortfall with his work through the air. The Bengals will look for a reset in a Week 4 road matchup against the Broncos, but that presents as another extremely challenging matchup for Cincinnati's Jake Browning-led offense as a whole.
#### Jerry Jeudy (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** The Browns' air attack had a quiet day overall, as David Njoku led Cleveland with a relatively sparse 40 receiving yards. Therefore, Jeudy's modest afternoon wasn't a surprise, and all three components of his receiving line were season-low figures. Jeudy remains Cleveland's No. 1 wideout, however, and he could be a lot busier in a Week 4 road trip to Ford Field to face off with the Lions.
#### Dak Prescott (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** The Cowboys got off to a disjointed start on offense, as Javonte Williams fumbled on the opening possession, with CeeDee Lamb (ankle) departing for the game one drive later. Prescott kept Dallas competitive for a while, guiding the team to a pair of field goals before connecting with George Pickens from two yards away for a touchdown. Prescott faded in the second half without his top pass catcher, averaging only 6.5 yards per attempt while throwing two picks. His fantasy outlook in Week 4 will depend significantly on Lamb's status, but a matchup against the Packers will be tough regardless.
#### CeeDee Lamb (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Jones didn't offer a whole lot in terms of a Lamb update, but the training staff stated Lamb's injury isn't as serious as it could have been, according to Jon Machota of The Athletic. Lamb got his ankle rolled up underneath him in the first half against Chicago and tried to return but lasted one play before he was ultimately ruled out for the remainder of the contest. Lamb will undoubtedly undergo further testing in the coming days ahead of next Sunday night's game against the Packers.
#### RJ Harvey (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Harvey received his usual handful of touches while backing up J.K. Dobbins (11-83-1), but the former failed to make an impact on the box score in such a limited role. The 24-year-old Harvey is averaging six combined touches through his first three games as a pro. It appears that it will take an injury to Dobbins for Harvey to see significant touches in this offense. For now, the electric rookie is just a name worth monitoring as the Broncos prepare to host the Bengals on Monday Night Football in Week 4.
#### Brenton Strange (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Strange led the Jaguars in both receptions and receiving yards on the afternoon with figures that also qualified as season highs for the third-year tight end. Strange has at least four targets in each of the first three games as he takes over what was a high-volume role during Evan Engram's tenure with the team. The 2023 second-round pick appears to have burgeoning chemistry with the inconsistent Trevor Lawrence, and Strange could once again serve as a key target when Lawrence tries to navigate an aggressive 49ers defense in a Week 4 road matchup next Sunday.
#### Patrick Mahomes (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** It wasn't Mahomes' prettiest game, but he managed to will Kansas City to its first win of the 2025 season. The star quarterback actually put the ball on the ground twice, but fantasy managers breathed collective sighs of relief when both fumbles were recovered by the Chiefs. Mahomes seemed more willing to take deep shots in this contest, dialing up Tyquan Thornton for a long score and drawing a massive pass interference penalty on a deep shot to Hollywood Brown that led to a quick field goal before halftime. Mahomes has yet to eclipse the 300-yard mark in passing through three starts, but he may be asked to air it out more against Lamar Jackson and the high-powered Ravens' offense next Sunday.
#### Xavier Worthy (WR)
**Injury Status:** Out <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** inactive
#### Stefon Diggs (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** The veteran wideout continues to have a quiet start to his Patriots tenure. Diggs has yet to reach 60 receiving yards in a game or score a touchdown through three weeks, and Sunday's three targets represented his lowest volume yet. The 31-year-old simply may not be the same player he was prior to the ACL injury that cut short his 2024 campaign with the Texans, but Diggs will look to continue building chemistry with Drake Maye in Week 4 against the Panthers.
#### Cam Skattebo (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Skattebo was expected to handle more work in Week 3, and he was forced into the lead-back role after Tyrone Tracy (shoulder) departed in the first quarter. Skattebo went on to be one of the few bright spots for the Giants, as he tallied their only touchdown of the game late in the second quarter on a 13-yard run. He was also a primary target in the short areas of the field, leading the team in targets, receptions and yards. The extent of Tracy's injury is unclear, but Skattebo's performance should put him in line for a significant role in Week 4 against the Chargers regardless of Tracy's status.
#### Tyrone Tracy Jr. (RB)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Tracy was injured late in the first quarter after colliding with Jaylen Watson on the sideline. He immediately grabbed his shoulder and was dangling it to his side as he walked off the field with the Giants' training staff. Cam Skattebo is now carrying the load for New York and being spelled by Devin Singletary. Prior to leaving, Tracy rushed seven times for 29 yards and caught two of three targets for seven yards.
#### Braelon Allen (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** While he still took a back seat to Breece Hall in the Jets' backfield, Allen came closer to an even split of the workload as Hall turned 13 touches into 52 scrimmage yards. The second-year RB is still only on the edge of the fantasy radar in most formats, but he's trending in the right direction headed into a Week 4 clash with the Dolphins.
#### Brandon Aiyuk (WR)
**Injury Status:** Out <br>
**Lineup Slot:** IR <br>
**Details:** Aiyuk remains on the PUP list, out through at least Week 4 and unable to practice with his teammates. Neither player nor team has said much about the situation of late, but coach Kyle Shanahan did suggest in mid-August that Week 6 (against Tampa Bay) was a reasonable target for Aiyuk's 2025 debut.
#### Bucky Irving (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** The second-year back fell just short of reaching 100 scrimmage yards for the second straight game, but he saw a season high in touch volume as the Buccaneers took a 23-6 lead into the fourth quarter. Irving is still looking for his first rushing TD of the year, as Tampa Bay got most of its scoring from kicker Chase McLaughlin (five field goals and two PATs) plus a 55-yard INT return for a touchdown by Jamel Dean. Irving could be productive again in Week 4 against an Eagles defense that just surrendered 112 combined yards and a receiving TD to the Rams' Kyren Williams.
#### Chris Godwin Jr. (WR)
**Injury Status:** Out <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** inactive
