## Player Report

#### Lamar Jackson (QB)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** The star QB left last Wednesday's practice early because a teammate stepped on his foot, and since then the team has downplayed the issue. Jackson's presence at Monday's practice should ease any lingering concerns on that front, though it's unclear if he'll be deemed a full participant Monday.
#### Joe Flacco (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Flacco was nearly flawless while working the Browns' first three drives, capping the second with a 15-yard TD strike to rookie tight end Harold Fannin. The 41-year-old is set as the Week 1 starter for Cleveland, and while the team may choose to take a look at one of the quarterbacks it selected in the 2025 Draft, Dillon Gabriel or Shedeur Sanders, if the season goes off the rails, Flacco offers a much more stable floor for the passing game, and targets such as Jerry Jeudy and David Njoku.
#### Marvin Mims Jr. (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Broncos coach Sean Payton said after Mims was forced to depart last Wednesday's practice early that he was expected to retake the field Monday, so it's encouraging to see the 2023 second-rounder following that timetable without any setbacks. By all indications, Mims is only dealing with a minor groin injury and remains on track for Sunday's regular-season opener against the Titans.
#### Nico Collins (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Collins played on the first two drives with the rest of the Texans' first-team offense and caught his touchdown from five yards out on fourth down to cap off the full first unit's time in the game. Collins is once again primed for a massive role in Houston's air attack this coming season, especially with Tank Dell (PUP-knee) still facing a highly uncertain return timeline.
#### Brock Bowers (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Bowers logged only one offensive snap in Las Vegas' first preseason contest Aug. 7, but he got more run against San Francisco. The second-year tight end's lone catch was a beauty -- he went up for a heave from Geno Smith that was contested by a 49ers defender and came down with the ball for a 28-yard gain. After setting an NFL rookie record with 112 receptions last year, Bowers figures to be Smith's top target in 2025, and he's arguably fantasy's most alluring tight-end option.
#### Jaylen Waddle (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Waddle played along with most of Miami's healthy starting offensive unit and was on the field for three possessions. He made his lone catch on the final drive on a pass delivered by Tua Tagovailoa, and Waddle will now turn his focus toward a Week 1 matchup against the Colts.
#### Tua Tagovailoa (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Tagovailoa made his preseason debut and led three offensive possessions, the final of which ended with a touchdown. Though Jaylen Waddle also played, Tagovailoa primarily targeted Malik Washington, who did the majority of the work on Tagovailoa's 25-yard touchdown pass. Most importantly, he came from the contest healthy and will be locked in as the starting quarterback for Miami's Week 1 matchup against the Colts.
#### Jordan Addison (WR)
**Injury Status:** Suspension <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Addison appeared to hurt his hand or arm Wednesday, resulting in him spending the rest of practice off the field as an observer. That he's avoided any sort of serious issue is an especially positive development considering that both Justin Jefferson (hamstring) and Jalen Nailor (hand) currently are nursing injuries of their own. Jefferson, at least, returned to practice Monday and has begun ramping up his activity level with the goal of being fully healthy for Week 1 against the Bears on Monday, Sept. 8. Addison, for his part, will miss time early in the regular season due to his three-game suspension, though he'll be allowed to suit up for Friday's preseason finale against the Titans if coach Kevin O'Connell decides to play his starters.
#### Jordan Mason (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Getting the start with Aaron Jones held out of the lineup Minnesota's exhibition opener, Mason saw a heavy workload on the team's first drive and then checked out of the contest. Mason was very productive last season with the 49ers in Kyle Shanahan's RB-friendly scheme, but it's not yet clear how big a role he'll have with the Vikings behind Jones, who is coming off a 2024 campaign in which he amassed 1,546 scrimmage yards and played all 17 regular-season games.
#### Garrett Wilson (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Wilson has yet to record a catch on four passes from new QB Justin Fields through two exhibitions, but the former's standing as the unquestioned No. 1 option in the Jets' passing game isn't in question. Once Week 1 rolls around, Wilson should be good for the typical 9.2 targets per game that he's averaged through three pro campaigns, all of which have resulted in 1,000-yard seasons.
#### Jaylen Warren (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Pittsburgh initially inked Warren via his second-year restricted free agent tender in March, a one-year deal, but per Gerry Dulac of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette his new deal extends through the 2027 season. That provides the Steelers with some long-term backfield clarity, with Warren and rookie third-round pick Kaleb Johnson positioned as a running back tandem for the foreseeable future. For the 2025 campaign Kenneth Gainwell, who is on a one-year deal, could also have a consistent role. Warren will be the favorite to operate as Pittsburgh's starter early in the regular season, and beginning Sunday on the road versus the Jets. Per Ian Rapoport of NFL Network, Warren's two-year deal includes over a $7 million contract for 2025 and $12 million guaranteed.
#### Jauan Jennings (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Jennings, who continues to seek a new contract with the 49ers after having requested a trade, is back on the practice field for the first time since late July. General manager John Lynch said in late August that the team doesn't intend to trade Jennings, but he spoke of the wide receiver's availability for Week 1 in uncertain terms. Even if Jennings is only practicing on a limited basis, his return to the field is a significant step in the right direction. Wednesday's first official practice report of the week will shed more light on Jennings' chances of suiting up Sunday versus the Seahawks.
#### Tyjae Spears (RB)
**Injury Status:** Injured Reserve <br>
**Lineup Slot:** IR <br>
**Details:** The move ensures that Spears, who has been managing a high-ankle sprain, will miss at least the first four games of the regular season. Tony Pollard will lead the team's backfield, with Julius Chestnut and Kalel Mullings (ankle) left to handle complementary snaps in Spears' absence, though it's possible that the Titans will add another running back from among other teams' cut-downs.
