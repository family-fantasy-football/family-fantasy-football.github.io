## Player Report

#### Trey McBride (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** He led the Cardinals in receptions, but it was Marvin Harrison who produced a team-high 71 receiving yards. McBride  is coming off a massive 2024 campaign in which he posted a 111-1,146-2 line on 147 targets, and while a breakout season from Harrison could cut into the tight end's volume, Arizona's target tree figures to be narrow. McBride will look to stay productive at home in Week 2 against the Panthers.
#### Hunter Renfrow (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The veteran wideout logged 42 offensive snaps during Sunday's loss, ranking third amongst Carolina receivers behind Tetairoa McMillan (53) and Xavier Legette (50). Although Bryce Young was forced to throw 35 times due to Carolina's 20-point fourth-quarter deficit, Renfrow still finished third on the team in targets, which could be a promising sign for his role in this offense. Renfrow is expected to continue serving as the Panthers' No. 3 wide receiver as the team travels to Arizona in Week 2.
#### Chuba Hubbard (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** The 26-year-old RB scored the Panthers' only TD late in the fourth quarter, catching the ball in the flat and sprinting down the sideline for a 27-yard score. Hubbard is coming off a career-best 2024 campaign in which he amassed 1,366 yards from scrimmage and 11 total touchdowns, and the offseason addition of Rico Dowdle to the backfield doesn't appear to have impacted his role or touch volume. Hubbard will look to stay productive on the road Week 2 against the Cardinals.
#### Ja'Marr Chase (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** The Bengals managed a surprisingly low 141 net yards, limiting the production of all their skill-position players. Chase tied for the team lead with five targets -- Joe Burrow attempted only 23 passes -- and also was responsible for the team's longest play from scrimmage on a 20-yard catch midway through the second quarter. While it was a disappointing start to the season, Chase and the entire Cincinnati offense should produce better in Week 2 against Jacksonville.
#### David Montgomery (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** The Lions' offense struggled to get on track, which led to underwhelming performances for nearly all of their skill-position players. Montgomery wasn't an exception, but he did manage 15 touches, nearly evenly matching Jahmyr Gibbs' 19. A more typical game script may change how the backs are deployed, but Montgomery still appears to have a significant role in Detroit's backfield heading into a Week 2 matchup against the Bears.
#### Dalton Schultz (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Schultz led the Texans in targets on a low-volume passing day, but the end result was still lackluster from a fantasy perspective. The good news for the veteran tight end is that he remained the No. 1 tight end option for QB C.J. Stroud despite posting mediocre numbers in 2024. Schultz should be considered a low-ceiling fantasy option heading into next Monday's tilt against Tampa Bay.
#### Travis Etienne Jr. (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The fourth-year RB headed into Week 1 with big questions about his spot on the Jaguars' depth chart, and how much of the workload he might have to share with Tank Bigsby and rookie Bhayshul Tuten. Etienne answered those questions in emphatic fashion, with his longest gain going for 71 yards in the second quarter to set up a Brian Thomas touchdown. Meanwhile, Bigsby and Tuten combined for just 23 rushing yards on eight carries, and neither one caught a pass. New coach Liam Coen turned Bucky Irving into a star last season in Tampa Bay, and at least through one week, he appears to be working that same magic with Etienne. He'll look to keep rolling in a Week 2 road battle against the Bengals.
#### Matthew Stafford (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Stafford missed the entire preseason dealing with a minor back injury, getting cleared just in time to start the regular-season opener. The veteran signal-caller showed no ill effects under center, producing a 109.1 passer rating with no turnovers in a tight victory. With Davante Adams (4-51-0) replacing Cooper Kupp across from star wideout Puka Nacua (10-130-0) this season, Stafford has one of the best WR duos at his disposal heading into next Sunday's road game against the Titans.
#### Rhamondre Stevenson (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Stevenson entered Week 1 as the presumptive lead back, although rookie second-round pick TreVeyon Henderson is already ticketed for a solid complementary role at minimum. However, Week 1 usage between the two players actually tilted toward Henderson due to his expansive pass-catching role (six receptions), although game script did play a part in that as well. Henderson is the more explosive of the two, but Stevenson could fill the role of the preferred early-down option in a Week 2 road matchup against the Dolphins if the game remains close.
#### Spencer Rattler (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The second-year QB didn't commit a turnover, but that was about the only silver lining to his Week 1 performance. Rattler attempted a career-high 46 passes in his first game in new coach Kellen Moore's scheme despite the fact that the score was fairly close all the way through, but his 4.7 yards per attempt was poor. With Tyler Shough waiting in the wings, Rattler may need to improve his numbers quickly to keep his starting job, beginning with a Week 2 home tilt against the 49ers.
#### A.J. Brown (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Brown's near shutout was alarming considering his typical importance to the Eagles' air attack, but both passing games were relatively subdued in the opener. While Brown garnered plenty of defensive attention, Dallas Goedert and Jahan Dotson appeared to be the biggest beneficiaries, and Brown finally got on the board with a timely eight-yard grab with 1:51 remaining to set up a game-sealing Jalen Hurts four-yard scramble. Needless to say, stat lines like Thursday's should be few and far between for Brown this season, and he's a virtual lock to be exponentially more involved a Week 2 road Super Bowl rematch with the Chiefs on Sunday, Sept. 14.
#### Brian Robinson Jr. (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Robinson had a smooth debut with San Francisco after being dealt from Washington just weeks before the start of the regular season. The 2022 third-round pick slotted directly behind starter Christian McCaffrey and handled 10 touches while playing 18 snaps on offense (24 percent). Robinson and his downhill running style should continue spelling CMC while receiving a handful of touches against the Saints next Sunday.
#### Cooper Kupp (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Kupp struggled to establish himself in Seattle's new-look offense, finishing a distant second behind Jaxon Smith-Njigba (9-124-0) in overall production. The 32-year-old Kupp may not be his former MVP self, but the fact he still finished second in targets bodes well for his prospects in games with higher passing volume than the 23 attempts Seattle amassed Sunday. For now, Kupp's fantasy value may be limited to deeper formats for next week's contest against the Steelers.
#### Sam Darnold (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Darnold failed to impress in his first game with the Seahawks after signing a lucrative deal this past offseason. The change of scenery couldn't erase the veteran signal-caller's propensity to come up short in the clutch. Darnold had Seattle deep in San Francisco's territory on the team's final drive when he lost grip of the ball on a windup that the 49ers recovered to effectively end the game. A bounce-back performance will have to come on the road against a T.J. Watt-led Steelers' defense next Sunday.
#### Jaxon Smith-Njigba (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Smith-Njigba had his coming out party as the unquestioned No. 1 option in Seattle following the departure of DK Metcalf to Pittsburgh this past offseason. The 23-year-old Smith-Njigba received 10 more looks than the next receiver (Cooper Kupp), immediately becoming new starting quarterback Sam Darnold's favorite target. JSN did suffer from a case of fumblitis when he put two balls on the ground (losing possession of one), something the wideout will surely work to clean up in practice. Smith-Njigba will look to build off a promising start to the campaign when the Seahawks take on the Steelers next Sunday.
