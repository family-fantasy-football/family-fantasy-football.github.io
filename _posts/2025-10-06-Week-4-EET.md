## Player Report

#### Trey Benson (RB)
**Injury Status:** Injured Reserve <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Arizona has lost its top two running backs in back-to-back weeks -- first James Conner to season-ending foot surgery following Week 3 and now Benson to a knee injury for at least the next four games after Week 4. Adam Schefter of ESPN reported earlier Wednesday that Benson underwent arthroscopic surgery for a meniscus injury and was slated to be out 4-to-6 weeks, so even if he isn't able to return from IR when first eligible Sunday, Nov. 9 in Seattle, he should be back in the fold not long after that. For the foreseeable future, Emari Demercado and Michael Carter line up as the best bets to pace the Cardinals backfield, while Bam Knight also is on the active roster and D'Ernest Johnson and Jermar Jefferson are candidates to be elevated from the practice squad.
#### Drake London (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The fourth-year wideout didn't reach 60 receiving yards or find the end zone in the first three weeks of the season, but London broke out in Week 4, highlighting his performance with a five-yard TD reception from Michael Penix in the first quarter. London led the Falcons in targets -- no one else got more than five -- as well as catches and receiving yards, and he remains the unquestioned top option in the team's passing game headed into a Week 5 bye, ahead of a tough Week 6 battle against the Bills.
#### Courtland Sutton (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Sutton led the Broncos in receptions, receiving yards and targets on the afternoon, recording a team-high 34-yard catch along the way. The veteran wideout fell just short of what would have been his second 100-yard game of the campaign, but he's now posted at least 81 receiving yards in three straight contests. Sutton figures to remain Bo Nix's top target when the Broncos travel to London to face the Jets in a Week 6 clash next Sunday.
#### Hollywood Brown (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Brown maintained a key role in the Kansas City offense even with the return of Xavier Worthy, as he was one of four pass catchers with at least five targets. He made an 18-yard grab early in the second quarter to set up a field goal, and he added a 15-yard touchdown catch early in the fourth quarter. Since an explosive Week 1 performance, Brown has not reached 50 receiving yards in a game, though he has consistently earned at least five targets.
#### Jakobi Meyers (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** With Brock Bowers (knee) unavailable, the expectation was that Meyers would be even busier than usual in his role as the Raiders' No. 1 receiver. However, all of Tre Tucker, Ashton Jeanty and even practice squad call-up Albert Okwuegbunam outpaced Meyers in receptions, receiving yards or both. After opening the season in typically productive fashion with a 17-228-0 line on 26 targets over his first three games, Meyers has slumped to an 8-62-0 tally on 13 targets over the last pair of contests. The veteran will have a good opportunity to bounce back in Week 6, however, as a suspect Titans defense comes to Las Vegas next Sunday afternoon.
#### Rashid Shaheed (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Most of that production came on a single play -- an 87-yard catch-and-run in the second quarter that Shaheed took to the house. The fourth-year wideout hadn't exceeded 52 receiving yards in a game this year prior to Sunday, and second-year QB Spencer Rattler may not be able to find his deep threat so easily against more competent secondaries, but it was still an encouraging sign for Shaheed and the Saints' aerial attack. He'll look for another big play or two in Week 6 against the Patriots.
#### Saquon Barkley (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Barkley's extremely sparse rushing volume was especially alarming considering game script never dictated that the Eagles turn away from the run. The reigning Offensive Player of the Year only salvaged his fantasy day with an impressive 47-yard touchdown grab to cap off the opening possession of the second half, and his carry total was his first in single digits in a non-injury-shortened game since Week 15 of the 2023 season while he was still with the Giants. Barkley's receiving score was his first trip to the end zone in a pass-catching capacity this season, and an atypically rested Barkley should be set for much more work in a Week 6 road matchup against his old New York teammates on Thursday night.
#### George Kittle (TE)
**Injury Status:** Injured Reserve <br>
**Lineup Slot:** IR <br>
**Details:** After missing the requisite four games upon being placed on IR following Week 1 action, Kittle will be eligible for activation during the upcoming week, but he seemingly hasn't made enough progress in his recovery from a hamstring injury to put himself in consideration for a return just yet. The 49ers could still elect to open Kittle's 21-day practice window next week, though Shanahan hinted that the team may prefer to wait until Week 7 before having the 31-year-old get back on the field, per Matt Barrows of The Athletic. While Kittle has been out for the past four weeks, the 49ers have had Jake Tonges and Luke Farrell share snaps at tight end, with the former player proving to be the more formidable pass-catching threat.
#### Brock Purdy (QB)
**Injury Status:** Out <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** With the toe injury keeping Purdy out for the third time in four games, backup Mac Jones made another start at quarterback Thursday and guided the 49ers to a win, despite working with a depleted pass-catching corps. Jones' solid work when called upon this season could prompt the 49ers to take a cautious approach with Purdy, who didn't practice at all this week and may not be ready to play in the team's Week 6 game at Tampa Bay, despite benefiting from a longer turnaround ahead of that Oct. 12 contest. The 49ers will likely have another update on Purdy's status when the team begins Week 6 prep next Wednesday.
#### Tony Pollard (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** It was an eventful day for Pollard with significant swings in performance. He picked up 26 yards on four carries on the Titans' opening drive, but his next notable contribution to the game was losing a fumble that set up an Arizona touchdown. Pollard then redeemed himself with a one-yard score of his own early in the fourth quarter to kickstart a frantic Tennessee comeback that resulted in the team's first win of the season. Also notable was that Pollard out-touched Tyjae Spears 17-4, though Spears is likely to become more involved in future matchups. Pollard has done an admirable job early in the campaign given the state of Tennessee's offense, picking up at least 60 yards on the ground in four of five games.
#### Zach Ertz (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** The 34-year-old tied Luke McCaffrey for the second-most receiving yards on the Commanders in Week 4, trailing Deebo Samuel's 72-yard performance. Although he ranked second on the team in yards, Ertz's performance was a little underwhelming considering two of the team's top three wideouts, Terry McLaurin (quadriceps) and Noah Brown (groin), were sidelined Sunday. Regardless, Ertz's target volume will likely stabilize when Jayden Daniels (knee) returns from injury, which could come in the Week 5 matchup against the Chargers.
