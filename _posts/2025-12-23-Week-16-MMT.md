## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Michael Carter (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Carter was officially named the starter after Bam Knight (ankle) was placed on injured reserve following the latter's early exit in last week's loss to Houston. The 26-year-old Carter logged seven fewer touches in Sunday's start than he did taking over mid-game for the starter in Week 15. The North Carolina product still commanded the lion's share of backfield carries, finishing well ahead of backups Corey Kiner (6-32-0) and Emari Demercado (5-30-0). Carter should continuing seeing enough volume as Arizona's fill-in starter to warrant fantasy consideration for Saturday's road tilt against the Bengals.
</div>

### 🟢 Khalil Shakir (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Shakir led the Bills in receptions, receiving yards and targets, but on an afternoon when Josh Allen threw for just 130 yards, that top billing didn't equate to much useful fantasy production. The Bills' passing game has been spreading the ball out all season, much to the chagrin of fantasy managers, and Shakir will take a modest average of 10.4 yards per reception for the season going into a Week 17 home showdown against the Eagles next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Harold Fannin Jr. (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Fannin continued his stellar rookie season with his fifth and sixth touchdowns of the campaign, including his first rushing score. The talented tight end first struck through the air via a 13-yard grab to open the scoring, and he added his short rush TD late in the third quarter to cap off a 14-play drive. Fannin had been averaging nine targets per game in Shedeur Sanders' first four starts coming into Sunday, and although he fell slightly short of that mark, he still tied for the team lead in that category with Quinshon Judkins (fibula/ankle).
</div>

### 🟢 Jake Ferguson (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> For the second straight game and the fourth time in the last eight contests, Ferguson failed to reach 20 receiving yards. After a fantastic start to the season, the fourth-year tight end has faded away, managing a poor 29-155-1 line on 40 targets during that eight-game span. He'll look to find a spark in Week 17 against the Commanders.
</div>

### 🟢 George Pickens (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> After a three-game stretch in which Pickens had posted a 14-158-0 line on 28 targets while CeeDee Lamb took center stage in the Cowboys' aerial attack, Pickens surged back to the forefront Sunday, capping his fifth 100-yard performance of the season with a 38-yard TD strike from Dak Prescott in the second quarter. Pickens has already put together a career-best campaign with 88 catches on 129 targets for 1,342 yards and nine touchdowns, and he'll look to stay locked in against the Commanders in Week 17.
</div>

### 🟢 Jahmyr Gibbs (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Lions ran a very pass-heavy offense, with Jared Goff attempting 54 passes compared to only 12 rushing attempts for the team. That naturally limited Gibbs' production on the ground, though he still underwhelmed as a rusher and has now been held below 50 rushing yards in four of his last six games. Gibbs still managed to have a productive fantasy performance thanks to his work as a receiver, as he recorded double-digit catches for the third time this season while also reaching the end zone on a four-yard reception late in the fourth quarter.
</div>

### 🟡 Woody Marks (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Marks' participating level remains unclear, but the Texans will be required to release an official injury report Tuesday since they travel to play the Chargers on Saturday. Marks was injured in the Texans' Week 15 win over the Colts and was inactive for this past Sunday's win over the Raiders. In Marks' absence, Jawhar Jordan out-snapped Nick Chubb 30 to 21, with Jordan rushing 15 times for 53 yards and adding five catches for 17 yards on five targets. Jordan would likely again be in line to lead the backfield if Marks misses Week 17 against the Chargers.
</div>

### 🟢 Michael Pittman Jr. (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Pittman tied with Alec Pierce for second in receptions on the night for the Colts, but he continued an extended stretch of middling production. Pittman has now recorded Monday's yardage tally or fewer in five of his last six contests, a stretch where he's played with three different quarterbacks. Pittman's quest to snap out of his funk gets another tough challenge in Week 17, as the Jaguars drop in on the Colts on Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Justin Herbert (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Herbert played what was arguably his best of the season Sunday, completely dissecting a Dallas defense that never felt like it had an answer throughout the afternoon. Notably the Pro Bowl quarterback was not sacked this week after facing relentless pressure the prior two contests, which had capped his fantasy impact as Herbert attempted to just stay upright. The 27-year-old spread the targets around dutifully as Ladd McConkey led the team with six, but notably this was the first game since Week 10 that Herbert connected with a wide receiver for a reception longer than 40 yards. Herbert is likely to have a much more difficult time come Week 17 against the Texans, who boast one of the best defenses in the league.
</div>

### 🟡 Davante Adams (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 J.J. McCarthy (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Out<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> According to Ben Goessling of The Minnesota Star Tribune, O'Connell said that McCarthy's injury is "similar to a bone bruise," adding that the Vikings don't view the issue as significant enough to send the second-year quarterback to injured reserve. The Vikings are thus leaving the door open for McCarthy to play in their season finale Jan. 4 versus the Packers, but he won't have sufficient time to heal up from the injury in advance of Thursday's contest. The Vikings will turn to Max Brosmer to make his second start of the season, after the undrafted rookie came on in relief for an injured McCarthy in this past Sunday's 16-13 win over the Giants.
</div>

### 🟡 T.J. Hockenson (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Vikings didn't officially practice Monday, but Hockenson is dealing with a shoulder injury that would've prevented him from participating had the team handled on-field reps. The starting tight end played 76 percent of the offensive snaps during Minnesota's win over the Giants in Week 16, though he secured his only target for two yards during that contest. With J.J. McCarthy (hand) now looking uncertain for Thursday's divisional matchup against the Lions, Hockenson has to be considered a low-floor fantasy option for Week 17 even if he is cleared for action on Christmas Day.
</div>

### 🟢 Drake Maye (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Maye bounced back in a big way following last week's zero-touchdown outing in a loss to the Bills. The surging sophomore produced his first 300-yard passing game under the bright lights of Sunday Night Football while leading his team back from an 11-point deficit in the fourth quarter. Maye went well over the 300-yard mark in Sunday's statement win to set a new career high for yards in a single game (380). The 22-year-old quickly overcame his first case of adversity and is looking like a true MVP candidate in his first year under head coach Mike Vrabel for the 12-3 Patriots. Fantasy managers should continue starting Maye with confidence ahead of next Sunday's favorable matchup against the Jets.
</div>

### 🟡 Alvin Kamara (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 Darius Slayton (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> On a day when New York logged 30 rushing plays and went to the air just 13 times, Slayton's eight receiving yards represented nearly a quarter of QB Jaxson Dart's paltry total of 33 passing yards. Slayton also tied for the second-most targets on the team (two), and only No. 1 wideout Wan'Dale Robinson finished with more receiving yards (19). Given the extreme run-heavy approach Sunday, not much should be taken away from any Giants pass-catcher's performance, but it's worth observing that Slayton has logged two or fewer receptions in three of his past four contests. A matchup against the Raiders' uninspiring secondary awaits in Week 17, though it should be interesting to see how both teams approach that game as the "loser" of the contest will have the clear inside track to the No. 1 overall pick in next year's NFL Draft.
</div>

### 🟡 Ricky Pearsall (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
