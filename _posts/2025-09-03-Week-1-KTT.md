## Player Report

#### Evan Engram (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Engram was naturally part of the first-team offense over the first three drives, but he closed out his preseason in quiet fashion after making a splash with a 58-yard catch against the Cardinals last Saturday. The veteran tight end is teed up for a significant role in the Broncos' Bo Nix-led offense, beginning with their Week 1 home matchup against the Titans.
#### Joe Mixon (RB)
**Injury Status:** Out <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Mixon is officially out the first four games of the year after having been placed on the Reserve/Non-Football Injury list Tuesday, but when prompted Wednesday for more clarity about a timetable for his potential return to the field, all Caserio said was that the team will "take it one day at a time," and that players on IR or the NFI lists will be evaluated "after four weeks and see where they are in their progression and then make a determination." Mixon has been sidelined throughout spring activities, training camp and the preseason, leaving Nick Chubb, Dameon Pierce, Woody Marks and Dare Ogunbowale as Houston's top backfield options to open the regular season.
#### Brian Thomas Jr. (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Thomas played two drives and worked as the top target for Trevor Lawrence over that span, especially in the absence of rookie wide receiver Travis Hunter (upper body). Expectations for Thomas are sky high after a 1,282-yard, 10-touchdown rookie regular season. The Jaguars will wrap up preseason play with a trip to Miami on Saturday.
#### Rashee Rice (WR)
**Injury Status:** Suspension <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Rice's suspension will begin immediately, as he and the NFL reached an agreement Wednesday on an arrangement that will force him to miss the first six weeks of the regular season but allow him to retake the field mid-season. He will first be eligible for reinstatement and to resume practicing Oct. 13 and to make his regular-season debut in Week 7 versus the Raiders on Oct. 19. JuJu Smith-Schuster figures to join Xavier Worthy and Hollywood Brown (ankle) in the majority of three-wide sets until Rice is reinstated.
#### Isiah Pacheco (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Pacheco handled the first and last touches of Kansas City's opening drive Friday, the latter of which netted him a two-yard touchdown. It is worth mentioning that veteran backup Kareem Hunt got the first crack at the goal line from three yards out on the previous carry before giving way to Pacheco. That's a scenario that could pop up during the regular season, where Pacheco has scoring opportunities poached by Hunt from in close. The 26-year-old Pacheco is still the preferred option for both his team and fantasy managers when the Chiefs take on the Chargers to open the season on Sept. 5 in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
#### Ladd McConkey (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** McConkey played one series with the majority of the Chargers' starters, including Justin Herbert. He hauled in his only target over the middle of the field and made a few defenders miss to pick up extra yardage. McConkey may not see the field again until Week 1 of the regular season, but his rapport with Herbert appears to be on track.
#### De'Von Achane (RB)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Achane will practice for the first time since he sustained a soft-tissue calf injury Aug. 16, a notable step in the right direction even if he's limited in his return to on-field work. McDaniel has consistently indicated that Achane is on track to play Week 1, though Miami has taken a cautious approach to his recovery and prioritized avoiding any setbacks. With Jaylen Wright (leg) not practicing Monday and trending in the wrong direction Week 1, expanded backfield opportunities behind Achane figure to be on tap for rookie Ollie Gordon, who McDaniel said "took advantage of an inopportune health situation," C. Isaiah Smalls II of the Miami Herald reports.
#### Kendre Miller (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Miller handled the first running back opportunity for the Saints and rattled off gains of eight and seven yards on his first two carries, with the second one wiped out by an offensive holding call. The oft-injured 2023 third-round pick is getting a fresh start with the new coaching staff in New Orleans, and he seems to be locked into the No. 2 role behind Alvin Kamara heading into a Week 1 home matchup against the Cardinals.
#### Wan'Dale Robinson (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** As with most of New York's key players, Robinson's time on the field was brief -- he played just seven offensive snaps, a bit fewer than fellow WR roster locks Darius Slayton (10) and Jalin Hyatt (11). Nonetheless, Robinson was the only member of that trio to get multiple targets, and his lone catch came on a short hookup with Russell Wilson. Robinson got a healthy 140 targets and caught 93 of them last season, though he averaged only 7.5 YPC. Malik Nabers (toe/shoulder) hasn't yet played in a preseason game, and he's expected to get the lion's share of attention among New York's receiving corps again in 2025. That should leave Robinson, Slayton and (to a lesser extent) Hyatt competing for looks from a new QB room that features Wilson, Jameis Winston and rookie Jaxson Dart.
#### Darius Slayton (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Slayton had been working through an undisclosed injury that caused him to miss the Giants' preseason opener against the Bills, but the 2019 fifth-rounder progressed enough in his recovery to suit up Saturday. Slayton is entering the final year of his two-year contract and is aiming to bounce back from a disappointing 2024 regular season in which his 39 catches for 573 yards were his lowest output since 2021 (26 catches for 339 yards). The Giants' quarterback situation in 2024 was shaky, but the addition of Russell Wilson should help raise Slayton's floor this season.
#### Aaron Rodgers (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Rodgers will sit out a third consecutive preseason game, as will No. 1 receiver DK Metcalf and star pass rushers T.J. Watt and Cameron Heyward. The veteran quarterback will have to wait until the Steelers' Week 1 opener to take on his former team, the Jets, on the road and make his debut in offensive coordinator Arthur Smith's scheme. Mason Rudolph will start under center once again Thursday.
#### Baker Mayfield (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** The Buccaneers used some starters in their second preseason game, but Mayfield wasn't one of them. They'll start Kyle Trask at QB this Saturday, followed by Teddy Bridgewater, allowing the two to continue their competition for the backup QB job. Mayfield, meanwhile, will be on the sideline to keep him healthy ahead of a Week 1 game at Atlanta. The Buccaneers may not have WR Chris Godwin (ankle), WR Jalen McMillan (neck) or LT Tristan Wirfs (knee) available for the contest, but they seem confident in first-round pick Emeka Egbuka stepping up to replace Godwin/McMillan, at least.
#### Austin Ekeler (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Ekeler and rookie Jacory Croskey-Merritt are the two running backs on Washington's list of players that won't participate. It's a sign they'll share work come Week 1 against the Giants, although there's also talk of Chris Rodriguez having a role, which might include short-yardage carries. The Commanders traded Brian Robinson to San Francisco for a sixth-round pick Friday, showing confidence in some combination of Ekeler, Croskey-Merritt, Rodriguez and Jeremy McNichols to form a committee. Ekeler's receiving skills make his role the most secure, although he's on the downside of his career and has fumbled 18 times (including playoffs) in 63 games over the past four season.
#### Jayden Daniels (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** There's a list of 33 players that won't take part Saturday, including Daniels, Marcus Mariota, Austin Ekeler, Jacory Croskey-Merritt, Terry McLaurin (contract), Deebo Samuel, Noah Brown (undisclosed), Jaylin Lane, Zach Ertz and John Bates. The next time we see most of them will be a Week 1 home game against the Giants.
