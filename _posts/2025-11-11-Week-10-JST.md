## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Emari Demercado (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Bam Knight (ankle) started Sunday's contest and led Arizona's backfield with 10 carries before exiting late due to injury. Demercado was already having the more productive day, although over half of his 100-plus yards from scrimmage came in garbage time. The TCU product could be in line to start against the 49ers next Sunday if Knight's injury proves to be serious. Demercado will also have to contend with the potential return of Trey Benson (knee) from injured reserve, but the former is currently the healthiest option out of Arizona's backfield heading into Week 11.
</div>

### 🟢 Michael Penix Jr. (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The second-year QB also tossed a two-point conversion but got sacked three times and lost a fumble. It's the third straight game in which Penix has failed to complete 60 percent of his passes, although Sunday's 42.9 percent mark was by far a season low. Drake London remains his lone reliable downfield threat, and the duo hooked up for a 16-yard TD in the second quarter and a two-point conversion in the fourth for the Falcons' final points on the day. Penix will try to turn things around on the accuracy front in Week 11 against the Panthers.
</div>

### 🟢 Rome Odunze (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Odunze bounced back from a Week 9 goose egg against the Bengals, leading the Bears in targets, catches and receiving yards Sunday. He accounted for Chicago's lone aerial score with a two-yard touchdown catch in the fourth quarter. Odunze could stand to improve his game-to-game consistency, but the 2024 first-round pick leads the Bears across the board with 37 catches, 559 receiving yards and six receiving touchdowns on 69 targets heading into a Week 11 road game against the Vikings.
</div>

### 🟢 Caleb Williams (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Williams struggled for most of a snowy Chicago afternoon but heated up in the last four minutes as the Bears staged a late comeback. He cut Chicago's deficit to 20-17 with 3:56 remaining in the fourth quarter on a two-yard touchdown pass to Rome Odunze, then Williams capped a four-play, 53-yard drive with a go-ahead 17-yard touchdown run just over two minutes later. The 2024 first overall pick has complemented his 13:4 TD:INT through the air in 2025 with the first three rushing touchdowns of his career, as well as a receiving touchdown. Williams has guided the Bears to a 6-3 record heading into a Week 11 road game against the NFC North rival Vikings.
</div>

### 🟢 D'Andre Swift (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Swift returned from a one-game absence due to a groin injury and out-touched Kyle Monangai 18-7, retaining the lead role in Chicago's backfield. Monangai scored an eight-yard rushing touchdown in the first quarter, but Swift produced a few highlights of his own on the ground, including a 25-yard scamper and a nine-yard run on fourth-and-2 on the same second-quarter drive. Swift also finished second on the team in targets, so he's well-positioned to maintain a heavy workload regardless of game flow in Week 11 against the Vikings.
</div>

### 🟢 Travis Kelce (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Kelce finished right around the single-game averages of 4.6 receptions and 59.3 yards that he entered Sunday's contest with, highlighting the consistent production the aging superstar has provided in fantasy this season. The 35-year-old enters Kansas City's Week 10 bye with a solid 41-540-3 receiving line through nine starts, putting him on pace to finish with his first 1,000-yard campaign since 2022. It is worth noting that Kelce was evaluated for a concussion at halftime, but he was cleared for the second half and finished without any reported setbacks. Kelce and the Chiefs will attempt to get back into the win column in a road tilt against the Broncos on Nov. 16.
</div>

### 🟢 Hunter Henry (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Henry logged an 87 percent snap share in the contest, per Mike Reiss of ESPN.com, but the Patriots tight ends weren't a big factor in the team's Week 10 passing attack, which was paced by WRs Mack Hollins (six catches) and Stefon Diggs (five catches). As Thursday night's game against the Jets approaches, Henry looks like a boom-or-bust fantasy option, given the way New England has been spreading the ball around of late. Overall, he's recorded a 30/377/4 receiving line on 47 targets through 10 games, with three of his TDs having been notched in a two-game span (Weeks 3 and 4) .
</div>

### 🟢 Chris Olave (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The fourth-year wideout put together his best performance of the season in terms of yardage, capped by a 62-yard TD in the second quarter. Olave failed to see double-digit targets for only the fourth time in 2025, but he's showing some good early chemistry with rookie QB Tyler Shough, who was making his second career start. Olave will take a 60-664-4 line on 94 targets through 10 games into the Saints' bye, before facing the Falcons in Week 12.
</div>

### 🟢 DeVonta Smith (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> In a game that featured three points scored through three quarters, Smith finally broke the silence with a 34-yard touchdown grab early in the fourth. Fellow star wideout A.J. Brown (hamstring) returned to action after fully healing over the bye week, but his 2-13-0 receiving line didn't affect Smith's hot streak. The latter is averaging 6.2 receptions and 99.8 yards over his last five appearances for the Eagles. Smith is looking like a WR1 heading into another primetime matchup in Week 11 when Philadelphia hosts Detroit.
</div>

### 🟢 Jalen Hurts (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Hurts fell victim to a frigid defensive battle at Lambeau Field on Monday Night Football. He coughed up his second fumble of the season at the end of a lengthy opening drive and followed that up with three punts and a turnover on downs in a scoreless first half. The 26-year-old came alive in the fourth quarter when he fired a 36-yard rainbow to DeVonta Smith for Philadelphia's only touchdown and game-winning score. Hurts may be asked to shoulder more of a load on offense Week 11 against a Lions offense that is clicking on all cylinders heading into Sunday Night Football.
</div>

### 🟢 DK Metcalf (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Metcalf saw a decent amount of opportunity with seven targets, the fourth time he's hit that mark this season. His longest gain went for 19 yards late in the first quarter, which came shortly after he narrowly missed out on a long touchdown. Regardless, Metcalf has only 41 total yards across his last two games while recording five receptions on 11 targets.
</div>

### 🟢 Christian McCaffrey (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> McCaffrey was stymied by the Rams' front seven Sunday, being held to a season-low 2.5 yards YPC in defeat. The dual-threat superstar managed to salvage his fantasy day with heavy involvement as a receiver, as he has done on multiple occasions this year. Change-of-pace back Brian Robinson (8-41-1) did just that on his eight carries, but this is still CMC's backfield for as many snaps he can handle. McCaffrey has a prime opportunity to correct his rushing woes next Sunday when San Francisco faces an Arizona defense that just surrendered 198 rushing yards and two touchdowns to Seattle in Week 10.
</div>

### 🟢 Rachaad White (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Patriots' league-best run defense unsurprisingly made life difficult for White on the ground, limiting him to a long run of seven yards. Game script eventually also tilted toward the pass for Tampa Bay, and White was a beneficiary thanks to his versatility. The veteran back continued to fill the lead role -- although by only a single carry Sunday -- in the ongoing absence of Bucky Irving (shoulder/foot), and he finished with a season-high catch total as well. Considering Irving has yet to return to practice, White could well be heavily involved again in a Week 11 road matchup versus the Bills.
</div>

### 🟢 Elic Ayomanor (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Ayomanor turned in a modest stat line, though he led the team in targets and yards. He nearly broke free for a touchdown on a 29-yard catch over the middle of the field to begin the third quarter, but it was still the second-longest catch of his rookie season. Ayomanor has topped 45 yards in each of his last two games after achieving that mark just once in his first seven contests.
