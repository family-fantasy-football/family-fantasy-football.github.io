## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 DJ Moore (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Moore has just one catch in the last two games combined after recording at least three catches in each of the 18 preceding regular-season games. Recent first-round draft picks Rome Odunze and Colston Loveland have led Chicago's passing game in recent weeks, and Moore's opportunities have been limited in a run-first Bears offense. Moore's pedigree suggests he's likely to bounce back at some point, and a Week 12 home game against a Steelers defense that has struggled to defend the pass offers an opportunity for the 28-year-old wide receiver to do so.
</div>

### 🟢 Tee Higgins (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Higgins capped Cincinnati's first possession with a 28-yard touchdown catch, but that was his only target of the first half. He was busier after halftime and finished as the team leader in receiving yards, while no teammate had more than 36 receiving yards in a rare off day for Cincinnati's passing game. Higgins extended his touchdown streak to four games (five touchdowns) ahead of a Week 12 home game against the Patriots.
</div>

### 🟢 Joe Flacco (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Flacco threw a 28-yard touchdown pass to Tee Higgins in the first quarter, but the Bengals didn't get their next points until a field goal in the third quarter, and Flacco threw a pick-six with Cincinnati in field-goal range on the drive after that field goal. The 40-year-old quarterback failed to throw multiple touchdown passes for the first time in five starts with the Bengals, and he posted his lowest total for passing yards since joining Cincinnati. The magic may be wearing off for Flacco, but with Joe Burrow (toe) reportedly targeting a Thanksgiving Day return in Week 13 against the Ravens, Week 12 against the Patriots might be Flacco's last starting opportunity.
</div>

### 🟡 C.J. Stroud (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jonathan M. Alexander of the Houston Chronicle anticipates that the Texans will list Stroud as a limited participant Tuesday in what would mark his first practice activity of any kind since sustaining a concussion in the team's Nov. 2 loss to the Broncos. Though Stroud still has a chance to clear the five-step protocol before Thursday, a lack of full practice participation on a short week would leave him highly unlikely to start against the Bills. Davis Mills thus looks headed for a third consecutive start, but Stroud's expected return to practice Tuesday would put in him in a good position to return to the lineup Week 13 versus the Colts on Nov. 30.
</div>

### 🟢 J.J. McCarthy (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> McCarthy turned 19 first-half pass attempts into just 74 yards and threw two interceptions as the Vikings took a 10-3 deficit into the locker room. He didn't complete another pass until less than three minutes remained in the fourth quarter, but McCarthy then proceeded to engineer a go-ahead drive capped by a 15-yard touchdown pass to Jordan Addison, which gave the Vikings a 17-16 lead. Chicago answered with a game-winning field goal on the game's final play, overshadowing McCarthy's late-game heroics. The struggling McCarthy has thrown for 158 yards or fewer in four of five starts heading into a Week 12 trip to Green Bay.
</div>

### 🟢 Juwan Johnson (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The tight end put together a career-best day in terms of yardage, including a 30-yard touchdown from rookie quarterback Tyler Shough in the fourth quarter, the second straight game in which the duo has connected for a score. Johnson is having a breakout campaign in his sixth NFL season, putting together a 43-491-3 line on 61 targets through 10 games heading into the Saints' bye week.
</div>

### 🟢 Devin Singletary (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Singletary wasn't efficient on the ground, but he made up for the modest yardage with five- and two-yard touchdown runs in the first half. The veteran back logged just three fewer carries than Tyrone Tracy, but the latter managed to double up Singletary in rushing yardage and also contributed 51 receiving yards. Consequently, Singletary projects to continue serving in a No. 2 role during a Week 12 road matchup against the Lions.
</div>

### 🟢 Dallas Goedert (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Goedert was held in check in what turned out to be a defensive battle between NFC contenders on Sunday Night Football. The two receptions marked the 30-year-old's lowest total since his one-catch effort back in Week 2. The five targets were on par with the 4.3 the tight end averaged coming into the contest, hinting at Sunday's dud simply being a down game from Goedert. The Eagles will take on the Cowboys next Sunday, who Goedert recorded a 7-44-0 line against when the two teams met back in Week 1.
</div>

### 🟢 Roman Wilson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Wilson was on the field for 57 percent of the Steelers' offensive snaps Sunday, marking just the second time this season that he's played more than half of the team's snaps. His uptick in playing time didn't lead to an increased target share, as he's seen two or fewer targets in eight of 10 of his appearances to begin the season. Wilson's fantasy upside will likely remain limited moving forward, especially if Aaron Rodgers (wrist) is forced to miss time.
</div>

### 🟢 Calvin Austin III (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Austin had played at least 50 percent of the Steelers' offensive snaps in his first seven appearances of the season, but he was on the field for just 29 percent during Sunday's comfortable victory. The 2022 fourth-rounder was held to single-digit receiving yards for the first time this year, but Pittsburgh was playing without Aaron Rodgers during the second half. Even if Austin's playing time bounces back down the stretch, he'll likely have limited fantasy upside as long as DK Metcalf remains healthy.
</div>

### 🟢 Kendrick Bourne (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Bourne saw his target share evaporate completely after recording just one catch in the 49ers' last contest. The healthy return of Ricky Pearsall (knee) was the primary reason for the fill-in starter's demotion. Bourne was on the field for 13 snaps on offense (24 percent), finishing behind third-string wideout Demarcus Robinson (29 percent) in the pecking order for playing time. If any managers were still hanging on to Bourne following his brief run of fantasy utility earlier in the schedule, they can safely move off the veteran ahead of next Monday's tilt against Carolina.
</div>

### 🟢 Jauan Jennings (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Ricky Pearsall (knee) returned to the starting lineup following a five-game absence, but Jennings still led all San Francisco wide receivers in targets and production Sunday. RB Christian McCaffrey and TE George Kittle accounted for all of the scoring, leaving Jennings with a pedestrian fantasy score despite finishing in a three-way tie for the team lead in targets. Jennings will attempt to get back into the scoring column against the Panthers next Monday after hitting pay dirt in each of his previous two appearances.
</div>

### 🟢 Zach Charbonnet (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Charbonnet failed to reach the levels of last week's season-best outing, resulting in a pedestrian fantasy score for Sunday's battle between NFC West contenders. The 24-year-old finished a distant second in the box score behind starter Kenneth Walker, who went over the century mark in total yards while scoring Seattle's lone touchdown. Charbonnet's nose for the end zone (six scores in nine appearances) keeps him in the flex zone in standard fantasy formats against the Titans next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Kenneth Walker III (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Walker was one of the few bright spots for Seattle on Sunday, scoring the team's only touchdown on offense while reaching the century mark in combined yards for the third time this season. The 24-year-old is up to 606 rushing yards through 10 games, surpassing the 573 yards he posted in 2024 on 18 fewer carries. Walker's improved efficiency on the ground (4.5 YPC) has helped stave off Zach Charbonnet from encroaching on the veteran's starting job. The latter was held to 47 yards on 13 combined touches Sunday, further cementing Walker as the preferred fantasy option heading into next Sunday's road tilt against Tennessee.
</div>

### 🟢 Terry McLaurin (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Out<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
