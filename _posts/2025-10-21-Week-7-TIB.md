## üè• Player Report

### üü¢ Kyler Murray (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Out<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Gannon also reiterated what he told Tyler Drake of ArizonaSports.com after Sunday's 27-23 loss to the Packers: that Murray will resume starting duties once he's healthy enough to do so. While Murray has missed the last two contests due to a mid-foot sprain, Jacoby Brissett has directed the offense during that stretch, completing 52 of 80 passes for 599 yards, four touchdowns and one interception, rushing nine times for 45 yards and losing his only fumble. Murray himself hasn't surpassed 220 passing yards in any of his five starts and has combined for a 6:3 TD:INT so far this season.
</div>

### üü¢ Darnell Mooney (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Mooney managed to suit up for the first time since Week 4 and was third in priority for targets behind Drake London and Kyle Pitts. He was used primarily as a deep target, and he delivered a 38-yard catch just before halftime to push the Falcons into field-goal range. Mooney is likely to see inconsistent targets and serves in a boom-or-bust role, both of which make him a risky fantasy contributor moving forward.
</div>

### üü¢ Kyle Pitts Sr. (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Pitts commanded double-digit targets for the third time in his career and for the first time since Week 5 of the 2023 season. Several of his targets came in the short areas of the field, leading to a modest yardage total, though he did manage long gains of 19 and 17 yards while also having a 27-yard catch nullified by a holding call early in the first quarter. While the volume of targets suggests this could have been a bigger game, Pitts has at least five catches in half of his six games this season and has topped 60 receiving yards in two of the last three contests.
</div>

### üü¢ Mark Andrews (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The positive for Andrews was that he remained involved in the Baltimore offense, finishing tied for second on the team in targets. He was unable to convert that into much production while catching passes from the combination of Cooper Rush and Tyler Huntley, with his longest gain going for only nine yards. The outlook for all Ravens pass catchers should improve with the anticipated return of Lamar Jackson (hamstring) in Week 8 following the team's bye, though Andrews could lose out on opportunity to more explosive options such as Rashod Bateman and Isaiah Likely.
</div>

### üü¢ Keon Coleman (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Coleman tied for the team lead in receptions and targets, but as his final line indicates, those opportunities were essentially for naught. The second-year wideout has endured an underwhelming season that's included a Week 5 benching for that game's opening series, and Coleman notably couldn't make an impact Monday despite the Bills being without Dalton Kincaid (oblique) and Curtis Samuel (neck/ribs) to begin the game and then losing Joshua Palmer (ankle) during the contest. Coleman and quarterback Josh Allen will have a Week 7 bye to work on their chemistry before returning to action Oct. 26 on the road against the Panthers.
</div>

### üü¢ Tetairoa McMillan (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> McMillan got the attention of Sauce Gardner (concussion) for most of the game, which led to limited opportunity and production. Ultimately, he was held to five targets and three receptions for the second consecutive game, combining to record only 62 yards in that span. Things could open a bit for McMillan in Week 8 against Buffalo, as the Panthers will almost certainly have to have an effective passing attack to have hope of keeping pace in the contest.
</div>

### üü¢ Javonte Williams (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Williams got back on track following last week's dud against Carolina (13-29-0) with his second 100-plus yard rushing game of the year. The 25-year-old kicked off the scoring with a short touchdown scamper on the Cowboys' opening drive, then proceeded to eat chunks of yardage throughout the contest. Williams is experiencing a true breakout fantasy campaign with a stellar 111-592-6 rushing line off of a career-best 5.3 YPC through seven starts in 2025. The 2021 second-round pick will get a chance to flex his newfound success against the team that drafted him when the Cowboys visit the Broncos next Sunday.
</div>

### üü¢ Marvin Mims Jr. (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Mims checked in as the Broncos' second-leading receiver in Sunday's comeback victory, finishing only behind Courtland Sutton's 6-87-0 receiving line. The 23-year-old Mims added 13 yards on his fourth rushing attempt of the season to finish as Denver's highest yardage producer. That said, Mims finished with two or fewer receptions in four out of his last five appearances, highlighting the playmaker's weekly volatility. Fantasy managers are hoping for one of Mims' "boom" games in a soft matchup against the Cowboys next Sunday.
</div>

### üü¢ Josh Jacobs (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Both TDs came in the second half as the Packers rallied from a 13-6 halftime deficit, with Jacobs hitting paydirt from seven yards out in the third quarter and from the one-yard line in the fourth for the game-winning score. It's the veteran back's third straight game with multiple touchdowns, and while he has yet to reach 100 rushing yards in a game in 2025, Jacobs' eight TDs on the ground and 593 scrimmage yards through six contests have given him plenty of fantasy value. He'll look to keep rolling in Week 8 against the Steelers.
</div>

### üü¢ Nick Chubb (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Head coach DeMeco Ryans proclaimed that he wanted to establish the run against the Seahawks, but he proceeded to give his veteran starter five carries in a game that was never quite out of reach. Chubb didn't do himself any favors, averaging a season-worst 3.2 yards per carry in the loss. Rookie Woody Marks (10-15-0) didn't fare much better on the ground, but he did catch C.J. Stroud's lone touchdown pass of the evening. Chubb had been providing a high floor for those in deeper formats prior to Sunday's dud, so it could be worth giving him another shot against San Francisco's injury-riddled defense Sunday.
</div>

### üü¢ Quentin Johnston (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Making his return from a one-game absence due to a hamstring strain, Johnston struggled with drops and didn't see a lot of volume, but he was still able to make an impact with a seven-yard TD reception from Justin Herbert in the third quarter. Johnston will take a 28-407-5 line on 46 targets through six contests into a Week 8 meeting with the Vikings, who just surrendered a combined 13-304-3 line to A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith.
</div>

### üü° Carson Wentz (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Wentz initially injured his left non-throwing shoulder Week 5 against the Browns in London but was able to suit up Sunday against the Eagles following a Week 6 bye. Overall, he completed 26 of 42 passes for 313 yards, no touchdowns and two interceptions, tallied four carries for 28 yards and didn't lose his only fumble. Wentz is averaging 268 passing yards per game and has a 5:4 TD:INT in his four-game starting stint in place of second-year signal-caller J.J. McCarthy, who remains in recovery mode from the high right-ankle sprain that he suffered Week 2. McCarthy also was listed as limited Monday, but Wentz appears poised to lead Minnesota's offense again Thursday at the Chargers, something that likely will be announced in advance of that contest.
</div>

### üü¢ Justin Jefferson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jefferson posted a team-high 40-yard reception during the close contest, but he ultimately played second fiddle to Jordan Addison, who finished with a 9-128-0 line on 12 targets, all team-high figures. Nevertheless, Jefferson's day wasn't a total washout by any stretch, and he extended his streak of 75-plus-yard tallies to five games while also getting to at least five receptions for the fourth consecutive contest. Jefferson hasn't found the end zone since Week 1 against the Bears, however, a matter he'll look to rectify Thursday night when the Vikings and Chargers open the Week 8 slate in Los Angeles.
</div>

### üü¢ Theo Johnson (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Johnson was the beneficiary of good fortune when he caught a tipped pass that was not intended for him for a 41-yard touchdown. It was the 24-year-old's fourth touchdown reception in as many weeks, providing a hot stretch of play for fantasy managers over that span. Johnson continues showing great rapport with rookie QB Jaxson Dart as the team prepares to face Philadelphia for the second time this season.
</div>

### üü¢ Justin Fields (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Fields has turned in back-to-back disastrous performances under center for New York, culminating in his being benched at halftime during the team's 12-6 loss to the Panthers in Week 6. Prior to being replaced by Taylor, Fields completed six of 12 passes for just 46 yards, with no touchdowns or interceptions, adding 22 yards on four carries. While part of Fields' struggles versus Carolina can be attributed to Garrett Wilson (knee) being inactive, he had been even worse Week 6 versus Denver in London, a loss in which he completed just nine of 17 pass attempts for 45 yards with zero touchdowns or interceptions while getting sacked an incredible nine times. The Jets will continue to evaluate the quarterback position before announcing a Week 8 starter, but at this stage, even with his rushing upside, Fields will be difficult to trust for fantasy purposes if he remains in the lineup.
</div>

### üî¥ Chris Godwin Jr. (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### üü¢ Jaylin Lane (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Lane finished as the Commanders' leading receiver in a game that Washington's top three receivers were forced to miss. The fourth-round rookie responded well by recording his best receiving line through seven pro appearances. With an extra day of rest between before next Monday's tilt against Kansas City, Lane could see his role reduced based on how many starters (if any) are able to return in Week 8.
