## Player Report

#### Khalil Shakir (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Most of Shakir's production came on a 43-yard touchdown in the first quarter, as he put his YAC ability on full display and broke multiple tackles on a reception initially made behind the line of scrimmage. He played a season-low 29 offensive snaps versus New Orleans, but game script may have been a factor in his reduced workload. Shakir has scored in back-to-back weeks and is one of the top targets for Josh Allen in a Bills offense that has piled up 30-plus points in all four regular-season games so far. He'll look to keep up his momentum at home against the division-rival Patriots in Week 5 on Sunday, Oct. 5.
#### Jake Ferguson (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Ferguson's perfect day at the office was highlighted by the tight end's first receiving touchdown of the season. The 26-year-old failed to sniff the 13 targets he averaged over his last two starts, but the increase efficiency coupled with a trip to the end zone resulted in his best standard fantasy score to date. Ferguson should continue operating as the Cowboys' No. 2 receiving option behind George Pickens for as long as CeeDee Lamb (ankle) remains sidelined -- a scenario that could repeat itself in a Week 5 matchup against the Jets next Sunday.
#### George Pickens (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Pickens had a breakout night as a member of the Cowboys, generating his first 100-yard and multi-touchdown performance with the club. The 24-year-old wideout led Dallas in targets, receptions and receiving production while taking over as Dak Prescott's top downfield option in the absence of CeeDee Lamb (ankle). Expect Pickens to continue garnering the lion's share of Prescott's attention as the Cowboys prepare to face the Jets next Sunday, although Sauce Gardner may have something to say about his final line.
#### Jahmyr Gibbs (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Gibbs found the end zone early in the contest, ripping off an eight-yard score with three minutes remaining in the first quarter. He also chipped in two rushes of more than 20 yards in the second and third quarters to top 90 rushing yards for the second time in four games this season. With Detroit up by multiple scores for the entire second half, Gibbs saw limited opportunity as a receiver, the only downside to his box score Sunday. He now has four total touchdowns in as many games to begin the campaign, while also topping 90 yards from scrimmage in each of the last three games.
#### Woody Marks (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** After touching the ball a combined 14 times across the Texans' first three games of the season, Marks set season highs in offensive snap share (56 percent), touches (21) and total yards (119) against Tennessee. He also scored a pair of touchdowns in the second half to help salt the game away. Additionally, Marks held up well in pass protection. Marks is shaping up as the leader of the Houston backfield moving forward and should be a priority pickup in fantasy leagues where he's available. Nick Chubb is averaging 4.0 yards per carry on his 47 rushing attempts this season and has done nothing to lose his job, but Marks is noticeably more explosive with the ball in his hands at this stage of his career.
#### Michael Pittman Jr. (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Pittman saw a season high in targets, which also marked the first time a Colts' pass catcher commanded double-digit targets on the campaign. He managed a modest yardage total, though he did record his third touchdown of the season on a two-yard catch early in the fourth quarter. Pittman isn't likely to deliver many huge performances given the competition for looks from Daniel Jones, but he has a minimum of four catches and 40 yards in each of his first four contests with his new QB.
#### Daniel Jones (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Jones continued to operate the Colts' offense efficiently, averaging 7.9 yards per attempt with three completions of more than 20 yards. He also appeared to have found Adonai Mitchell for a second touchdown on a 76-yard connection, but the wideout fumbled the ball through the end zone for a touchback. Jones made some mistakes of his own, throwing two interceptions on underthrown deep passes -- the latter of which came late as the Colts were trying to tie the game. Jones has passed for at least 250 yards in three of four games this season, though he has only one score in consecutive contests.
#### Bhayshul Tuten (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The 23-year-old rookie took a back seat to Travis Etienne, who cracked the century mark in rushing yards while cashing in a long touchdown. Tuten will find it hard to generate consistent production so long as he is limited to a handful of carries, as he has been early in the campaign. The 2025 fourth-round pick may need an Etienne injury to warrant fantasy consideration heading into a Week 5 matchup against Kansas City next Monday.
#### Tre' Harris (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Harris played just 12 offensive snaps as the lethargic Chargers offense relied on multiple tight ends to slow New York's pass rush. The imminent loss of Joe Alt (ankle) could mean Harris sees even less time on the field for the foreseeable future with the team intent on keeping Justin Herbert upright.
#### Justin Herbert (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** The 27-year-old quarterback committed multiple turnovers for the first time in 2025 while throwing for a season low in passing yards as the Chargers took their first loss, but Herbert did salvage his day to some extent with a 36-yard TD to Quentin Johnston late in the second quarter. Herbert still has a respectable 7:3 TD:INT through four games heading into a Week 5 tilt against a Commanders defense that just gave up career-best numbers to the Falcons' Michael Penix.
#### Davante Adams (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Adams got in a limited practice Friday and overcame a questionable tag from a hamstring injury in order to suit up for Sunday's tilt, and the veteran superstar cashed in his third receiving touchdown in as many weeks in the waning moments of the first half. Puka Nacua (13-170-1) stole the show offensively, but Adams has been producing strong numbers operating as the No. 2 option for the Rams this season. The 32-year-old will carry a 17-269-3 receiving line into Thursday's home matchup against the 49ers in Week 5.
#### T.J. Hockenson (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Hockenson wasn't targeted until just before halftime and didn't make his first catch until the Vikings' first drive of the fourth quarter. However, he saw plenty of opportunity in short areas of the field in the final 10 minutes of the game as Minnesota attempted to rally from a two-score deficit. Though Hockenson ended up with a respectable line on five targets, Jordan Addison's return predictably appears to have cut into his target volume.
#### Drake Maye (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Maye's ultra-efficient stat line underscored New England's all-around dominance on the afternoon, and he didn't need to do much as a passer in the second half after the Patriots took a 28-6 lead into halftime. The second-year signal-caller connected with seven different targets while hitting Hunter Henry and Mack Hollins for scores. Maye added his second rushing touchdown of the campaign on a five-yard run to open the second quarter, and he'll look to extend his streak of games with multiple TD passes to four when New England visits Buffalo for a Week 5 road showdown next Sunday night.
#### Alvin Kamara (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Kamara had his second-most productive rushing output of the season and averaged over 4.2 yards per carry for the second time this year. The 30-year-old had been shouldering the bulk of the rushing workload with 50 of the team's 79 carries over the first three games, but RB2 Kendre Miller closed the gap with a season-high 11 rushing attempts for 65 yards Sunday. This may have been part of the Saints' offensive gameplan, as the team logged more rushing attempts (34) than passing attempts (28) for the first time this season. Kamara will look to record his first 100-yard rushing performance of the season next week, facing a Giants defense that's allowed a league-worst 6.1 yards per carry through four weeks.
#### Ricky Pearsall (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The second-year wideout is one of three 49ers receivers who won't practice Tuesday, with Jauan Jennings (ankle/ribs) and Jordan Watkins (calf) also scheduled to sit out. Pearsall's absence comes after general manager John Lynch suggested that he's being viewed as questionable for Thursday's game against the Rams. The 49ers will wait and see how Pearsall is feeling Wednesday before determining whether he'll take a designation into Thursday's contest, or if he'll end up being ruled out a day in advance. Pearsall was limited to season lows in receiving yards (46) and snaps (37) in this past Sunday's 26-21 loss to the Jaguars after exiting the game with what Shanahan described as a minor PCL injury.
