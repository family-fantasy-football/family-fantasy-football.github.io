## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Drake London (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> London boxed out his defender on a leaping one-yard touchdown catch in the first quarter, then high-pointed the ball for a two-yard score in the second quarter and added a one-handed snag for an eight-yard touchdown in the fourth. A missed PAT after London's third touchdown catch proved to be the difference as Atlanta's comeback attempt came up short, but London showed no ill effects from the hip injury that kept him out of the Week 8 loss to the Dolphins. The Falcons' other wide receivers combined for only three targets against the Patriots, so London's locked in as the team's top option in the passing game heading into a Week 10 matchup against the Colts in Berlin.
</div>

### 🟢 Justice Hill (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Hill's 11 snaps marked a season low as Baltimore deployed Keaton Mitchell for roughly the same number of plays as the veteran. Lamar Jackson targeted Hill twice, and he managed to bring both in for receptions. Through eight games, Hill has just one game with more than 20 rushing yards, and his pass-catching has tapered off since the bye with just two combined targets in his last two games. Baltimore heads to Minnesota in Week 10.
</div>

### 🟡 Joshua Palmer (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 Courtland Sutton (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Texans' secondary did a good job of blanketing Sutton most of the afternoon, but he was able to beat Derek Stingley down the sideline for a TD late in the second quarter. Sutton snapped a four-game scoring drought with the catch, but it's the third time in nine contests he's been held to only one grab, leaving him with a 38-566-4 line on 62 targets for the season. The veteran wideout should be much more productive against a more vulnerable defense in a Week 10 home tilt against the Raiders.
</div>

### 🟢 Jakobi Meyers (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> A pending free agent, Meyers had made it clear that he wanted to be moved ahead of Tuesday's trade deadline, and the Raiders were able to find a suitor in the Jaguars who were willing to take on the remainder of the wideout's $5.25 million base salary. In Jacksonville, Meyers will fill the void in the slot that opened up when No. 2 overall pick Travis Hunter (knee) landed on injured reserve last week. As was the case in Las Vegas with star tight end Brock Bowers in the fold, Meyers will face competition for targets in Jacksonville with another impressive young pass catcher in Brian Thomas (ankle), but there should be enough volume to go around for both receivers to remain productive. Over his seven appearances for the Raiders this season, Meyers recorded 33 catches for 352 yards and no touchdowns on 49 targets.
</div>

### 🟢 Trevor Lawrence (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> While fantasy managers who are planning on using Lawrence in Week 9 lineups can probably still feel comfortable doing so, the fact that he's under the weather could result in him playing at something less than 100 percent health coming out of the Jaguars' Week 8 bye. In addition to battling the illness, Lawrence will have to make do without one of his top pass catchers in rookie wideout/cornerback Travis Hunter (knee), who was surprisingly moved to injured reserve Friday and will now miss at least four games.
</div>

### 🟢 Hollywood Brown (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Brown resurfaced after being held without a catch in last week's rout of the Raiders. The Chiefs were playing from behind for most of this contest, which helps explain the deep threat's increased involvement Sunday. Brown's four targets checked in at fourth among Kansas City receiving options, a trend that should continue moving forward now that the team's receiving corps is back to full strength. Brown's reduced role should keep him in deep-league territory for fantasy purposes against the Broncos in Week 10.
</div>

### 🟡 Aaron Jones Sr. (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jones thus seems to have a chance to play this coming Sunday against the Ravens after suffering what he described as an AC joint sprain Week 9, per Tom Pelissero of NFL Network. Jones was running well before exiting in the third quarter, racking up 98 yards from scrimmage on 11 touches, while fellow RB Jordan Mason accounted for 11 touches for 37 total yards. Wednesday's injury report may provide a baseline for Jones as he seeks to miss no additional time.
</div>

### 🟡 Brock Purdy (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🔴 George Kittle (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Kittle focused primarily on blocking as the 49ers fed Christian McCaffrey 33 touches, which the star running back turned into 173 scrimmage yards and two touchdowns. In three games since returning from a hamstring injury suffered in Week 1, Kittle has produced just 75 yards and a touchdown. The possible return of Brock Purdy (toe) against the Rams in Week 10 may get Kittle going.
</div>

### 🟢 Rashid Shaheed (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Widely expected to be moved ahead of Tuesday's deadline, Shaheed ultimately landed in Seattle, where he'll join a pass-catching corps that had been lacking in quality depth behind No. 1 option Jackson Smith-Njigba, who leads the NFL with 948 receiving yards. After drawing 36 targets over his final four games with the Saints, Shaheed may lose out on a few looks with the move from New Orleans to Seattle, but his efficiency should improve while he gets an upgrade in quarterback play from Spencer Rattler/Tyler Shough to Sam Darnold. In addition to providing the Seahawks with a deep-ball threat on offense to complement Smith-Njigba, Shaheed also excels as a punt returner, having averaged 12.6 yards on 64 career runbacks.
</div>

### 🟢 Tony Pollard (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Pollard out-carried Tyjae Spears 10-7, though the touches were nearly identical when taking into account receptions. Unlike past weeks, Pollard was the more efficient back, as he opened the game with rushes of 16 and 12 yards on Tennessee's first possession. While there were some positives to take away from the performance, Pollard hasn't found the end zone since Week 5, and the split in touches will likely continue to hamper his fantasy outlook.
</div>

### 🟢 Zach Ertz (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Ertz remained one of Jayden Daniels' (arm) more reliable targets, as he led the team in yards while finishing second in targets and receptions. He logged a pair of receptions on Washington's first possession that went for 17 yards, and he also tallied a long 25-yard catch on the Commanders' opening drive of the second half. Ertz's outlook moving forward is complicated by the likely absence of Daniels, as he has only nine receptions for 78 yards combined across Marcus Mariota's three starts this season.
