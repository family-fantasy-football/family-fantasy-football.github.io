## Player Report

#### Justice Hill (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Hill made an additional mark outside of fantasy matchups when he ripped off a 59-yard return on special teams. Baltimore's talented backup recorded his fourth touchdown of the season on quarterback Lamar Jackson's fifth passing touchdown of the game. Hill remains a boom-or-bust option (due to his limited usage) for those in deeper leagues as the Ravens prepare to host the Steelers on Saturday.
#### Jerome Ford (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Ford opened the game in his usual complementary role behind Nick Chubb, but the latter eventually exited the game due to what was subsequently determined to be a broken foot. Ford broke off a 62-yard touchdown run late in the fourth quarter to account for the majority of his yardage, but he should be poised to handle a lead-back role moving forward for what remains of the season with Chubb sidelined.
#### Jerry Jeudy (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Jeudy comfortably led the Browns in receptions, receiving yards and targets on an afternoon when Jameis Winston and Dorian Thompson-Robinson combined for just 154 passing yards and threw four interceptions between them. The 2020 first-round pick of the Broncos is putting the finishing touches on a career year despite his team's struggles, now boasting a 70-1,052-4 line across 14 games. Both the reception and receiving yardage totals are new high-water marks for the talented wideout, but he could see a downturn in production over the final three games if head coach Kevin Stefanski opts to turn to the erratic Thompson-Robinson at quarterback the rest of the way following Winston's benching Sunday.
#### Jake Ferguson (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Dallas was able to take its foot off the gas in the second half thanks to a multi-score lead, and Cooper Rush attempted nine passes in the final two quarters. That limited volume for all pass catchers with the exception of CeeDee Lamb, and Ferguson saw only four targets -- good for third on the team -- as a result. The game script should look different in a Week 16 showdown with Tampa Bay, giving Ferguson a better chance to produce.
#### Tucker Kraft (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Kraft did most of his damage on a jump ball that he corralled for a 26-yard gain late in the second quarter, but he didn't see a target after that point, leaving him below 50 receiving yards for the fifth time in the past six games. During that span, he's mustered 15 catches for 179 yards on 21 targets, but he's salvaged two of those performances with TD catches. In an offense that has leaned toward the run most weeks since a Week 10 bye, Kraft must take full advantage of the handful of targets that he may receive, and he'll look to do just that Week 16 against the Saints on Monday Night Football.
#### Jordan Love (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** After Josh Jacobs ran in a touchdown on the opening drive, Love doubled Green Bay's lead with a 13-yard touchdown pass to Romeo Doubs. Love had only one incompletion as the Packers produced points on all four of their first-half drives to take a 20-3 lead into the locker room. Green Bay's offense slowed down in the second half, but the defense did its job, and Love added some breathing room with a 22-yard touchdown pass to Romeo Doubs with 4:59 left in the fourth quarter. This clean performance improved Love's TD:INT to 23:11 heading into a Week 16 home game against the Saints.
#### Josh Jacobs (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Jacobs was involved from the get-go with 44 scrimmage yards on seven carries and two catches on the opening drive, which concluded with a one-yard touchdown run. He finished the first half with 17 touches for 111 yards but struggled after halftime. Jacobs went backward in the third quarter with four carries for minus-5 yards, then fumbled in the fourth. He racked up some more yardage as the Packers kept the clock running with the lead but was stuffed on fourth-and-2 with 5:55 left. Jacobs came six rushing yards shy of his fourth 100-yard rushing performance, but he's up to 12 rushing touchdowns in 14 games with the Packers and will look to add to that total against the Saints in Week 16.
#### Tank Dell (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Dell's receiving yardage total, modest as it was, qualified as the second highest on the Texans for the afternoon behind Joe Mixon's 33. Dell also recorded his longest rush since Week 2 with his 15-yard run, but he's now posted under 40 receiving yards in five of his last eight games overall. Dell will look to make inroads against the Chiefs' defense in a Week 16 road matchup on Saturday afternoon.
#### Alec Pierce (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** questionable
#### Patrick Mahomes (QB)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Mahomes was forced out of Sunday's 21-7 win over the Browns in the fourth quarter, leaving backup Carson Wentz to close out the contest. Now, with the Chiefs facing a short turnaround for Week 16's matchup against the Texans on Saturday, then a road matchup against Pittsburgh on Christmas Day coming Week 17, Mahomes' availability for the remainder of the regular season is murky at best. Currently, at 13-1, Kansas City has a two-game lead on Buffalo (11-3) for the top seed in the AFC, and the Chiefs have already clinched a playoff spot. The team figures to take a cautious approach to Mahomes' health in order to prioritize his effectiveness for the postseason, making it appear likely that Wentz starts Saturday versus Houston. For Weeks 17 and 18, though, playoff standing could potentially factor into decisions made on Mahomes' availability.
#### Jonnu Smith (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Smith was the Dolphins' leader in receptions and targets while checking in second in receiving yards. The veteran tight end has at least nine catches in three of his last four games, and his seven-yard touchdown grab with 4:30 remaining was Smith's fifth score in the last five contests as well. The FIU product heads into a Week 16 home matchup against the 49ers with a career-best 70 receptions and 740 receiving yards over 14 games, while his six touchdowns are the second most of his career.
#### Alvin Kamara (RB)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Kamara was forced out of New Orleans' 20-19 loss against Washington in Week 15 in the second half, and it's possible his groin injury could impact his availability for Monday night's road matchup against Green Bay on Dec. 23. If Kamara were to miss any time, second-year pro Kendre Miller and veteran Jamaal Williams would be positioned as the lead options in the Saints backfield. Further details on Kamara's health may not be made available until later during Week 16 prep, with New Orleans' first official practice scheduled to occur Thursday.
#### Chris Olave (WR)
**Injury Status:** Injured Reserve <br>
**Lineup Slot:** IR <br>
**Details:** In other words, the Saints aren't shutting Olave down for the season -- at least not yet -- but he's unlikely to play this Sunday against the Commanders when first eligible to return from IR. Olave sustained his second concussion of the season and his third in less than a year in the Saints' Week 9 loss to the Panthers on Nov. 3.
#### A.J. Brown (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Brown made headlines throughout the week after being critical of Philadelphia's passing offense, but he did his part to quiet that storyline by making a season-best eight receptions while topping 100 yards for the fifth time in 11 contests. His performance was highlighted by long receptions 21, 20, 19 and 17 yards as well as a five-yard touchdown late in the first quarter. Brown's strong performance was almost soured late in the game, when he got up slowly after an apparent hip-drop tackle, though he was spotted moving fine in the locker room following the win, per Eliot Shorr-Parks of Sports Radio 94 WIP Philadelphia.
#### Mike Williams (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Playing without Pickens in Week 14 against the Browns, Williams resurfaced in the Steelers' air attack, albeit modestly, with a 3-36-0 line on four targets. However, that represented a significant uptick in involvement for the veteran trade-deadline acquisition, whose only reception in a Steelers uniform prior to that game had been a 32-yard touchdown catch in his Week 10 team debut against the Commanders. Williams again will have added opportunities for targets Sunday, although those will come versus a talented Philadelphia secondary that's allowed an NFC-low 178.5 passing yards per game.
#### Jauan Jennings (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Just four days after bringing in seven of eight targets -- a pair of touchdown grabs among them -- against the Bears, Jennings saw a team-high target total in Thursday's rainy conditions but was highly inefficient. The veteran wideout entered Thursday with a solid 73.1 percent catch rate on the season, and his struggles led to his lowest yardage total since Week 6. Jennings will aim to bounce back against a talented Dolphins secondary in a Week 16 road interconference battle on Sunday, Dec. 22.
#### Jaxon Smith-Njigba (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Smith-Njigba was the lone bright spot among Seattle receivers Sunday, leading the team in every notable category by a large margin. The sophomore standout has quietly become the top wideout for a team boasting two proven veterans at the position. Smith-Njigba has generated at least 69 yards of offense over his last seven contests with four touchdowns scored over that span. Continue riding the hot hand down the stretch as the Seahawks prepare to host the Vikings next Sunday.
#### Baker Mayfield (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Mayfield posted a stellar 135.3 passer rating en route to a lopsided victory between cross-conference playoff hopefuls. The four scores also helped the 2018 first-overall pick set a new high-water mark in touchdown passes (32) in a single season. Mayfield continues to prove that last year's breakout with Tampa Bay was no fluke, as he is now 383 yards away from recording consecutive 4,000-yard campaigns. It would take a season-best effort against the Cowboys on Sunday Night Football in Week 16 to accomplish the feat, but the late-blooming QB makes for a strong fantasy play whether or not he hits the 4K mark in passing yards next Sunday.
#### Austin Ekeler (RB)
**Injury Status:** Injured Reserve <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Ekeler said he doesn't remember walking off the field Nov. 24 against the Cowboys, or indeed anything until he got in the ambulance to go to the hospital. The veteran running back also states he had memory loss following his Week 3 concussion earlier in the season. All of these symptoms led to Ekeler's placement on injured reserve ahead of Week 13, sidelining him until at least Week 18. Brian Robinson, Jeremy McNichols and Chris Rodriguez are set to handle backfield duties while Ekeler is out.
