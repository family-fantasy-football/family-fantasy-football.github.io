## üè• Player Report

### üî¥ Bryce Young (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Doubtful<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Pelissero added that Young's sprain typically requires a recovery timeline of 2-to-4 weeks, and Andy Dalton is expected to start against Buffalo. Young was injured on a third-quarter sack Sunday, though X-rays did come back negative. Young being sidelined shouldn't significantly impact the fantasy outlook of the Panthers' pass catchers, as Dalton is a reliable veteran backup.
</div>

### üü¢ Rico Dowdle (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Chuba Hubbard returned after a two-game absence and drew the start over Dowdle. The duo then alternated possessions, with Dowdle turning in the far more efficient performance by outgaining Hubbard, 96-48 in total yardage. Dowdle has certainly gained a more significant role in the Carolina offense with his strong showings across the last three weeks, though it doesn't appear the team is prepared to turn the backfield over to him fully at this point.
</div>

### üü¢ Chase Brown (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Brown left a mostly frustrating first six games of the season in the rearview mirror Thursday, posting a season high in rushing yards by a wide margin. Prior to Thursday, Brown hadn't even cracked 47 rushing yards in any contest, but he blew past that threshold on his way to his first 100-yard tally since Week 9 of last season, with the help of a season-long 37-yard run. Brown's overall workload still remained modest, however, but Cincinnati doesn't figure to have to take as much of a pass-heavy approach when the Bengals return to action in a Week 8 home matchup against the Jets on Sunday, Oct. 26.
</div>

### üü¢ Jerry Jeudy (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jeudy tied with multiple teammates for second in receptions and was also the runner-up for the Browns in targets. However, with Dillon Gabriel barely clearing the 100-yard mark through the air, those numbers were exceedingly modest. Jeudy's five-catch, 66-yard tally back in Week 1 against the Bengals remains his best performance of the season, and he'll head into a Week 8 road matchup against the Patriots having fallen short of 20 receiving yards in two of the last three games.
</div>

### üü¢ Dak Prescott (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Prescott welcomed his favorite target CeeDee Lamb (ankle) back with open arms and a beautifully placed ball for a 74-yard touchdown on Dallas' final possession of the first quarter. The 31-year-old Prescott finished the contest registering at least three touchdown passes for the fourth consecutive week. A red-hot Prescott upped his season totals to 1,881 passing yards and 16 touchdowns on a career-best 72 percent completion rate through seven starts. With all of his weapons back at full strength, Prescott should be treated as a top-10 fantasy QB heading into next Sunday's tilt against Denver.
</div>

### üü¢ CeeDee Lamb (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Lamb made a triumphant return from an ankle injury that forced him to miss the Cowboys' last three contests. The superstar wideout looked every bit of his usual self on the field, pacing Dallas in targets and receiving yards while ripping off a 74-yard reception for his first touchdown of the season. The Oklahoma product is averaging 7.0 receptions and 110.7 yards in the three starts he has been able to complete. A healthy Lamb will have to outplay lockdown corner Patrick Surtain in order to record his fourth 100-yard game of the year when the Cowboys visit the Broncos next Sunday.
</div>

### üü¢ Xavier Worthy (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Worthy saw only four targets for the second consecutive game, a concerning trend given the return of Rashee Rice in Sunday's shutout win. Rice immediately came back to lead the team in every receiving stat and will likely remain Patrick Mahomes' favorite target moving forward. That will leave Worthy reliant on big plays to produce strong fantasy performances and make him more of a boom-or-bust option in future weeks.
</div>

### üü¢ Patrick Mahomes (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Mahomes had a very efficient day and jumped on the Raiders early, leading touchdown drives in each of the Chiefs' four possessions. He completed three passes of more than 20 yards, including a 44-yard connection with Travis Kelce on the team's first possession, and had passing scores from two, eight and three yards away. After throwing for only one touchdown in the first three games of the season, he has at least three passing scores in three of his last four contests. With Rashee Rice back in the mix and Xavier Worthy healthy, the Chiefs' offense should have the chance to take off in the second half of the campaign.
</div>

### üü° Darren Waller (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Waller was forced out of Miami's loss to the Browns in Week 7 after playing just 15 offensive snaps without recording a catch, and he now appears to be trending in the wrong direction for Sunday's matchup against the Falcons. With the Dolphins already without Tyreek Hill (torn ACL) for the rest of the season, an absence for any stretch of time on Waller's part will be a significant blow to a passing game that's already struggling. Tight ends Julian Hill and Tanner Conner will benefit from increased workloads Week 8 if Waller can't go, as will wide receiver Nick Westbrook-Ikhine in the No. 3 role behind Jaylen Waddle and Malik Washington. Head coach Mike McDaniel said Monday that Waller isn't expected to be available versus Atlanta or on Thursday Night Football against the Ravens in Week 9, per Cameron Wolfe of NFL Network.
</div>

### üü¢ TreVeyon Henderson (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Henderson remained uninvolved in the Patriots' offense, logging one carry in the second quarter and one in the fourth quarter. Rhamondre Stevenson dominated touches, while Terrell Jennings picked up five carries in garbage time. While game script led to Henderson's lowest touch total of the season, the Patriots continue to not prioritize him in the offense.
</div>

### üü¢ Stefon Diggs (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Diggs had almost all of his production in the third quarter, tallying three receptions for 49 yards. That was enough for him to lead the team in all receiving stats, with his only shortcoming being his inability to reach the end zone. While it has taken Diggs some time to settle into the New England offense, he now has at least six catches in three of his last four games while posting 344 receiving yards in that span.
</div>

### üü¢ Cam Skattebo (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Skattebo followed up the first multi-score game of his career with his first trip to the end zone as a receiver through seven pro appearances. The bruising tailback had actually been fairly active in the pass game prior to Sunday's touchdown catch, averaging 3.3 receptions and 25.8 receiving yards in the previous six games. Skattebo did finish below 4.0 yards per carry for the third time this season, but he is still commanding the lion's share of touches out of the Giants' backfield. Fantasy managers should continue riding Skattebo next Sunday against the Eagles in a rematch from Week 6, when the rookie hit paydirt thrice.
</div>

### üü¢ Mason Taylor (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Taylor stepped up as expected in the absence of Garrett Wilson (knee), though the quarterback play held back his stat line. He finished second on the team in targets behind Josh Reynolds despite not getting any looks until midway through the third quarter with Tyrod Taylor under center. Taylor has shown some promise in his rookie season, but it's difficult to trust any Jets pass catcher while Wilson is sidelined and the signal caller remains in flux.
</div>

### üü° Bucky Irving (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### üü¢ Elic Ayomanor (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Ayomanor had a chance to step up in the absence of Calvin Ridley (hamstring) but it was Chimere Dike who instead had a relatively big performance. Ayomanor managed to tie for second on the team in targets, but he had a very quiet day after recording a 20-yard catch on the Titans' opening possession. He now has fewer than 30 receiving yards in three straight games.
