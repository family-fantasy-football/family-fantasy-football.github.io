## Important League Changes for 2025 Season

The league has approved several significant changes that will take effect for the upcoming season. Please review these carefully as they will impact your draft strategy and in-season management.

### Waiver System Overhaul

**OLD:** First Come, First Serve waivers  
**NEW:** FAAB (Free Agent Acquisition Budget) continuous system

- Each team receives **$100 budget** for the entire season
- Bid on players you want - highest bid wins
- Budget management becomes a strategic element
- No more staying up late for waiver priority!

### Quarterback Scoring Changes

#### Touchdown Passes
**OLD:** 4 points per TD  
**NEW:** 6 points per TD

#### Completion Percentage (NEW!)
- **+0.5 points** for each completion
- **-1.0 points** for each incompletion
- **Break-even point:** 66.7% completion rate

*Example: 20/30 passing = (20 Ã— 0.5) + (10 Ã— -1) = 0 points from completion percentage*

### Tight End Scoring Boost

**OLD:** 0.5 PPR (Half Point Per Reception)  
**NEW:** 0.75 PPR

This change aims to increase TE positional value and create more interesting draft decisions.

### ðŸ“‹ Roster Composition Changes

**OLD:** 8 Bench spots + 1 IR spot  
**NEW:** 7 Bench spots + 2 IR spots

- Slightly less roster depth, more strategic decisions
- Extra IR spot provides better injury management flexibility
