## Player Report

#### Michael Penix Jr. (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Penix and veteran backup Kirk Cousins will both sit out a third consecutive preseason game, with Falcons coach Raheem Morris opting to rest veteran starters until the regular season. Atlanta waived quarterback Emory Jones (concussion) with an injury designation Monday, per Tori McElhaney of the Falcons' official site, leaving Easton Stick and new signee Ben DiNucci in position for preseason reps versus Dallas.
#### Jalen Coker (WR)
**Injury Status:** Injured Reserve <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Panthers head coach Dave Canales said Coker has a "serious quad strain," per Mike Kaye of The Charlotte Observer. While the second-year wideout's placement on IR allows him to retake the field after a minimum of only four games, it sounds like his return could be postponed until as late as Week 7 against the Jets on Sunday, Oct. 19. With Carolina also having traded Adam Thielen to Minnesota, the team inked veteran wideout Hunter Renfrow to the active roster Saturday to help provide depth behind Tetairoa McMillan (hamstring) and Xavier Legette.
#### Rome Odunze (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Odunze showed marked improvement over his catchless outing last week with Friday's team-leading performance. The 2024 first-round pick caught QB Caleb Williams' only passing touchdown while also finishing with Chicago's longest reception (37 yards). Odunze will attempt to build off of a modest 54-734-3 receiving line as a rookie when the Bears kick off the regular season against the Vikings on Sept. 8.
#### D'Andre Swift (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Swift made his 2025 preseason debut Friday after sitting out an additional game against Buffalo last week. The 26-year-old moved the ball well on eight touches as he prepares to lead Chicago's backfield for the second consecutive campaign. Swift generated 1,345 yards from scrimmage and six touchdowns in 17 regular-season starts last year, numbers he could easily reproduce with a clean bill of health in 2025.
#### Caleb Williams (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Williams carried the momentum over from his impressive preseason debut into Friday's exhibition finale where he dialed up Rome Odunze for a touchdown late in the first half. Chicago's offense sputtered out of the gates with a pair of punts, but Williams was unfazed and finished with another encouraging performance with Week 1 just around the corner. Expectations will be high for Williams when his sophomore season officially kicks off on Sept. 8 against the Vikings, after the organization signed the hottest head coaching free agent in Ben Johnson and surrounded the signal-caller with a talented supporting cast.
#### Jayden Reed (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Reed returned to practice Wednesday after resting for three weeks, acknowledging afterward that he wasn't 100 percent and was still "working through" the injury. It's an issue that often requires surgery and a multi-month timeline for rehab/recovery in such a scenario. He'll thus try to avoid surgery, or at least delay it until the offseason, but his fantasy value plunges with the added injury risk (and possibility of reduced performance or limited workloads). Reed intends to play Week 1, although Green Bay's medical staff has a reputation for being cautious with injured players. He's participating in Thursday's padded practice scrimmage, per Rob Demovsky of ESPN.com.
#### Travis Kelce (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** A slimmer Kelce made his preseason debut Friday after sitting out the Chiefs' first two exhibitions. The 35-year-old decided to lace up for a 13th season after his team was unceremoniously bounced from the Super Bowl by the Eagles in 2024. Kelce's numbers have been steadily declining since his last 1,000-yard season back in 2022. That said, an over-the-hill Kelce still warrants fantasy consideration at a very shallow position.
#### Hunter Henry (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** After logging six snaps in the Patriots' preseason opener, Henry didn't see action in the team's final two exhibition tilts, with an eye toward keeping him healthy ahead of Week 1. Henry, who is coming off a 2024 regular season in which he recorded a receiving line of 66/674/2 on 97 targets in 16 games, approaches the coming campaign as New England's top pass-catching option in a TE corps that also returns Austin Hooper, who recorded 45 catches on 59 targets while working in tandem with Henry last year.
#### Chris Olave (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Olave finished in a three-way tie for the team lead in receptions while profiling as the runner-up in receiving yards. The 2022 first-round pick made catches of 12, seven and 10 yards while working with Spencer Rattler on the Saints' first three drives, and he'll head into the regular season poised to reprise his No. 1 receiver role while working with either Rattler or rookie Tyler Shough as his quarterback.
#### DeVonta Smith (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** That's also the case with A.J. Brown (hamstring), so the Eagles will indeed have both wideouts available for Week 1 action. As the coming season approaches, Smith and Brown remain the team's clear-cut top two options at their position, with Jahan Dotson, John Metchie and Darius Cooper rounding out Philadelphia's WR corps.
#### Jalen Hurts (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Hurts didn't play in the preseason as the Eagles used the exhibition slate to evaluate their backup quarterback options after trading away Kenny Pickett in the offseason. Hurts didn't need the reps after leading Philadelphia to a Super Bowl title last season, but he'll be ready to go for the start of regular-season play against the Cowboys on Thursday, Sept. 4. He's being drafted as a consensus top-five fantasy quarterback in most formats after averaging 20 passing touchdowns and 13 rushing TDs over the past four regular seasons.
#### Kaleb Johnson (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Johnson came in at the start of the third drive, after Jaylen Warren and Kenneth Gainwell were done playing (but before the first-string offensive linemen were removed). The rookie had gains of seven and eight yards on his carries behind the starting O-line, and he didn't play at all after halftime. It was a nice finish to the preseason, with back-to-back solid outings after struggling in Pittsburgh's opener, but Johnson won't necessarily have a large role come Week 1 against the Jets. That doesn't mean he won't be a key part of the offense as the season progresses, but there's risk of a three-man committee initially, with Warren presumably starting and Gainwell seemingly on track for at least a small role.
#### Christian McCaffrey (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** McCaffrey won't see any exhibition action this year, but by all accounts he's been looking like his pre-2024 self after dealing with Achilles tendinitis in both legs and a PCL sprain in his right knee last season. In parts of three campaigns since being traded from Carolina to San Francisco in October 2022, he's averaged 115.5 yards from scrimmage per game and scored 31 TDs in 31 regular-season games.
