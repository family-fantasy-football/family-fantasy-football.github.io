## Player Report

#### Chuba Hubbard (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Hubbard led the backfield as expected with Jonathon Brooks (knee) sidelined. However, he couldn't get things going, in large part because Carolina ran only 50 offensive plays. That led to his lowest yardage output on the ground since Week 1. Positively, Hubbard did remain involved as a pass catcher, as this marked his third game with at least four catches in his last five matchups.
#### Keenan Allen (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Allen bounced back from last week's dud against the 49ers (3-30-0) with a performance against the Vikings that was reminiscent of his dominant days with the Chargers. After a terribly slow start to the season, the veteran wideout has posted a 23-271-4 receiving line over his last four contests. Allen will attempt to keep his recent string of hot play going Week 16 against the Lions on Sunday.
#### David Njoku (TE)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Stefanski offered similar availability for Cedric Tillman (concussion), as both he and Njoku were sidelined for Cleveland's 21-7 loss to the Chiefs in Week 15. After Jameis Winston was benched in favor of Dorian Thompson-Robinson versus Kansas City, however, it remains to be seen who will be under center on the road against the Bengals, even if Njoku manages to retake the field. Wednesday's first official practice report will reveal more details regarding the standout tight end's health.
#### Brandin Cooks (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** CeeDee Lamb dominated the looks from quarterback Cooper Rush with a 9-116-1 line on 13 targets, and while Cooks finished second on the Cowboys in targets, catches and receiving yards, it was Jalen Tolbert and Jalen Brooks who were on the end of Rush's other two touchdowns. Cooks has seen limited volume since returning from a knee injury that cost him seven games in the middle of the season, posting a 7-53-2 line on 15 targets over the last three contests, and he'll be a TD-dependent fantasy option Week 16 against Tampa Bay's vulnerable secondary.
#### Bo Nix (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Nix reverted to the poor form he showed early in the season, throwing an interception on Denver's first drive and adding another two picks in the third quarter. He connected with Adam Trautman for a 13-yard touchdown pass in the second quarter, and after Denver's defense held the fort while Nix found his game, the rookie quarterback created some breathing room with fourth-quarter touchdown passes of 15 and 20 yards to Nate Adkins and Courtland Sutton, respectively. Nix has a 4:5 TD:INT in his last two starts after posting an 8:0 mark over the three preceding games, so he'll look to clean up the mistakes on a short week Thursday against the Chargers.
#### Courtland Sutton (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Sutton was quiet prior to scoring a 20-yard touchdown with 5:48 remaining in the fourth quarter. That play was enough to propel him into the team lead in receiving yards as Bo Nix threw for only 130 yards in this turnover-filled matchup. Sutton has seen at least eight targets in seven consecutive games heading into Thursday's clash with the Chargers, and this was the first time in that busy stretch that Sutton failed to reach 70 receiving yards.
#### Jayden Reed (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Reed was more involved after seeing just one target in Week 14 against the Lions, as he tied Christian Watson for the team lead in targets and led the Packers in catches, though four teammates had at least 34 receiving yards as well. Reed also produced 10 yards on two punt returns, one of which he muffed for a fumble but managed to get back on top of the ball. The slumping wide receiver will be a touchdown-dependent fantasy option in Week 16 against the Saints given his sporadic recent usage, but Reed's a perennial threat to score considering he has 17 total touchdowns through 30 career regular-season games.
#### Anthony Richardson (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Richardson scored a 23-yard rushing touchdown on the opening drive, marking his fourth rushing score in the past four games. He hasn't been nearly as successful with his arm as his with his legs, and Richardson's accuracy issues unsurprisingly resurfaced against the tough Broncos secondary. He completed just 44.7 percent of his passes and was intercepted twice, dropping his TD:INT as a passer to 7:11. Richardson's rushing ability should keep him fantasy-relevant in Week 16 against the Titans, but he'll have a low floor due to his struggles through the air.
#### Isiah Pacheco (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Pacheco and backfield mate Kareem Hunt finished with the same number of carries, one week after Pacheco appeared to reclaim his lead-back role with 16 totes against the Chargers. Hunt actually outgained Pacheco by 13 yards and one target, although the latter did more with his one pass-catching opportunity. The division of labor in the ground attack during a tough Week 16 home matchup Saturday afternoon against the Texans will therefore be interesting to monitor, and if star signal-caller Patrick Mahomes were to miss that game with the ankle injury he suffered Sunday, it could be even tougher sledding on the ground for either back.
#### Tre Tucker (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Tucker was one of four Raiders pass catchers to earn at least five targets Sunday, but he was by far the least productive. The speedster will remain a boom-or-bust option in Week 15 against a Falcons secondary that just allowed Vikings wideouts Justin Jefferson and Jordan Addison to combine for a 15-265-5 receiving line on 19 targets, though Tucker may be catching passes from quarterback Desmond Ridder after Aidan O'Connell suffered a bone bruise to his left leg Sunday.
#### Jordan Addison (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Addison tied Justin Jefferson for the team lead in receptions on the night while checking in second behind his teammate in both receiving yards and targets. The talented second-year wideout got off to a hot start, as four of his catches came during two first-half possessions. Addison has logged 21 targets over his last two games and parlayed them into 196 receiving yards heading into a Week 16 road battle against the Seahawks where he should be busy once again.
#### Derek Carr (QB)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Rizzi said it "wouldn't be a reach" for Carr to retake the field before the conclusion of the regular season, though it remains to be seen whether a road matchup with the Packers on Monday Night Football will be a realistic target for the veteran quarterback. Carr is nursing a fracture in his left, non-throwing hand and is simultaneously working his way through the concussion protocol. Jake Haener was benched early in Sunday's loss to the Commanders, while Spencer Rattler nearly led the team to a comeback win after entering the game.
#### Pat Freiermuth (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Freiermuth saw an increase in role with George Pickens (hamstring) sidelined for the second consecutive week, though the Steelers offense never got going. His stat line was modest as a result, with his primary contribution being a nine-yard touchdown reception just before halftime. Freiermuth has now found the end zone in three straight games while tallying at least three receptions in four straight contests.
#### DK Metcalf (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Metcalf actually finished as Seattle's second-leading receiver despite seeing his fewest targets to date in 2024. That statistic highlights how poor of a passing performance Geno Smith (knee) and Sam Howell combined for against the Packers' rabid defense. Metcalf has taken a backseat to Jaxon Smith-Njigba (10-83-0) in the second half of the season, but the former still holds fantasy value heading into a Week 16 matchup against the Vikings.
#### Zach Charbonnet (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The entirety of Seattle's offense was stymied by Green Bay's defense aside from Charbonnet's 24-yard touchdown scamper early in the fourth quarter. The surging sophomore has thrived in his last two starts sans Kenneth Walker (calf), unearthing 259 yards from scrimmage with three touchdowns as the Seahawks' primary back. Walker could potentially return in Week 16, which would put a significant dent in Charbonnet's value at a crucial point of the fantasy campaign. Until the former is officially ruled active, managers should hang on to the talented backup in the event he draws another start against the Vikings next Sunday.
#### Rachaad White (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Bucky Irving (back/hip) wound up suiting up after getting injured last week against Las Vegas, leading to an even split in carries between Tampa Bay's tailbacks. White scored the backfield's lone touchdown as a receiver while Irving stole the show with 117 rushing yards with his 15 totes. The latter is the preferred fantasy option in this timeshare, but White retains deep-league value for next Sunday's tilt at Dallas.
#### Calvin Ridley (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Ridley saw his fewest targets since Week 4, though he still made explosive plays with the ball in his hands. He tallied long receptions of 21 and 16 yards and supplemented that with a 19-yard rush off the right end late in the third quarter. Even so, Ridley has 60 or fewer yards from scrimmage in four of his last five games.
