## Player Report

#### Khalil Shakir (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The highlight of Shakir's night was a tie-breaking 15-yard touchdown grab just after the halfway point of the fourth quarter, a play on which he went in motion before reversing course at the snap, catching a swing pass out of the backfield and scooting up the left side of the field into the end zone. Shakir's receiving line represented a decent resurgence after he was limited to one catch for 12 yards against the Jets in Week 2, and he'll remain one of Josh Allen's primary targets in a Week 4 home matchup against the Saints on Sunday, Sept. 28.
#### Harold Fannin Jr. (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Tanin was tied for third in receptions and targets on the Browns for the afternoon while also garnering that slotting in receiving yards. It was Fannin's quietest performance yet in his brief NFL career, but the rookie third-round pick is clearly a key component of the passing attack and could enjoy a bigger role in a Week 4 road matchup against the Lions for which Cleveland figures to have to remain aggressive on offense.
#### George Pickens (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Pickens looked to be in for a very big performance after the departure of CeeDee Lamb (ankle), as he tallied a long catch of 21 yards and recorded a two-yard touchdown on a drive early in the second quarter. However, Pickens disappeared in the second half, with his only catch coming on a target from Joe Milton after the game was out of reach with four minutes remaining in the fourth quarter. Though Pickens padded his line in garbage time, he has exactly 68 yards with a touchdown in each of his last two games.
#### Jake Ferguson (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Ferguson commanded double-digit targets for the second consecutive week, though he was aided by the absence of CeeDee Lamb (ankle) in Sunday's loss. Ferguson was targeted exclusively in the short areas of the field, with his longest gain of the day going for only 12 yards. While his showings haven't been particularly explosive, Ferguson has a key role in the Dallas offense and has topped 75 receiving yards in consecutive contests.
#### Jahmyr Gibbs (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Gibbs was uncharacteristically inefficient on Monday Night Football, failing to crack the century mark in total yards despite handling a season-high 27 touches. Fortunately for managers, the fantasy stud still generated RB1 numbers by making his second and third trips to the end zone this season. David Montgomery (12-151-2 rushing line) also went off for Detroit in a shining example of a true timeshare that can produce two valuable assets on a weekly basis. Gibbs will face another stiff test defensively when the Lions host the Browns on Sunday.
#### Woody Marks (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Marks logged just three fewer carries than backfield mate Nick Chubb, recording new career highs in rush attempts and rushing yards in the process. The rookie fourth-round pick also recorded a reception for the second consecutive game, and Marks could see his role continue to expand in a Week 4 home matchup against a Titans defense that allowed 102 rushing yards and three touchdowns to Jonathan Taylor on Sunday.
#### Michael Pittman Jr. (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Daniel Jones distributed targets fairly evenly, as four Colts pass catchers were targeted at least four times. Pittman led the way in every statistic, highlighted by a 20-yard touchdown grab early in the third quarter and a 17-yard gain later in the same quarter. While Pittman has the potential to be the leader of the receiving corps, targets have been relatively evenly distributed through three weeks, so Pittman will need to rely on efficiency to deliver strong statistical lines in most weeks.
#### Daniel Jones (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Jones and the Colts enjoyed a three-possession lead by early in the third quarter, so he took to the air only nine times in the second half. The results when Jones took to the air remained strong, as he connected with Michael Pittman for a 20-yard touchdown, and he also completed seven passes of at least 15 yards. Jones failed to reach the end zone on the ground for the first time this season, though he continues to take care of the ball and lead an efficient Colts offense.
#### Bhayshul Tuten (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The rookie No. 2 back logged nine fewer carries than Travis Etienne, but he matched his backfield mate in rushing touchdowns by recording a one-yard scoring run in the first quarter. Tuten also tallied a receiving TD in Week 2, and it's clear he'll continue to operate in a reliable complementary role as the Jaguars travel to face the 49ers in Week 4.
#### Tre' Harris (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Harris' lone look from Justin Herbert came in the third quarter on a deep pass that fell incomplete. While Harris' production was down from Week 2 against Las Vegas (two catches on three targets for 34 yards), he did see the field for 25 offensive snaps against Denver, and his playing time has increased over the first three games of the regular season. Next up for the Chargers is a Week 4 road bout against the Giants.
#### Justin Herbert (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Herbert made two absolutely stunning throws in this one, the latter connecting for a game-tying touchdown by Keenan Allen on a broken play in the fourth quarter. The sixth-year quarterback has been absolutely scintillating to start 2025 and does not appear to be flustered by any matchup. Even Herbert's lone blemish came on a dropped pass that caromed back to the waiting arms of Broncos safety Brandon Jones. Sunday's 47 pass attempts is tied for the Pro Bowler's most since 2023 and seemed to be a byproduct of the team trying to claw back during a second half that largely saw the Chargers trailing.
#### Davante Adams (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Adams beat Cooper DeJean deep down the left sideline late in the first quarter for a 44-yard touchdown. That accounted for the majority of Adams' production on the day, as Puka Nacua overshadowed him. While Nacua's role in the offense is likely to take some of the upside away from Adams, the latter has at least eight targets in all three of his games with the Rams.
#### T.J. Hockenson (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The veteran tight end had put together a quiet first two games of the season, mustering just a 4-27-0 line on seven targets. However, Hockenson tied for the team lead in receptions Sunday while checking in second in both receiving yards and targets as he worked with Carson Wentz for the first time. Hockenson also got into the end zone for the first time in 2025 on a five-yard grab late in the third quarter, and he's slated to operate with Wentz as his quarterback again in next Sunday's Week 4 matchup against the Steelers in Dublin, Ireland, since J.J. McCarthy (ankle) is expected to remain sidelined for that contest.
#### Drake Maye (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** The second-year QB found Hunter Henry for scores in the second and fourth quarters, but the rest of the Patriots' offense struggled on the afternoon, especially on the ground -- Maye led the team in rushing yards, and RBs Rhamondre Stevenson and Antonio Gibson combined to lose three fumbles. Maye has a 5:2 TD:INT through three games to begin his sophomore season, but in Week 4 he faces a Panthers defense that surprisingly just shut out the Falcons and fellow 2024 first-round pick Michael Penix.
#### Alvin Kamara (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Kamara was stifled by Seattle's defensive front from the get-go, resulting in the tailback's worst per-carry average (2.3 YPC) in a single game since Week 7 against the Broncos last season (1.4 YPC). It was surprising to see the 29-year-old used so sparsely as a receiver in such a lopsided loss; perhaps the 38-6 deficit at halftime sucked the competitiveness from New Orleans' sideline. Kamara remains the focal point of a struggling Saints offense despite posting his first dud through three weeks. Fantasy managers can expect heavy involvement from the dual-threat RB in a tough road matchup against Buffalo next Sunday.
#### Ricky Pearsall (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Pearsall was the last man standing for the 49ers' starting passing offense with Brock Purdy (toe/shoulder), George Kittle (hamstring) and Jauan Jennings (ankle) all missing Sunday's tilt. The 24-year-old Pearsall was up to the task, finishing as the club's leading receiver while making several key drive-extending grabs. Expect Pearsall to continue spearheading San Francisco's depleted receiver room -- potentially with his starting QB back under center -- against the Jaguars next Sunday.
