## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟡 Bam Knight (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Knight appears to have avoided a severe injury, with league sources telling Schefter that the running back is nursing  "a bad sprain," but that could still notably impact his availability for the last three weeks of the regular season. Emari Demercado and Michael Carter will be positioned as Arizona's clear backfield leaders if Knight misses any time, with James Conner (foot) and Trey Benson (knee) both already having been lost for the year. Knight's first opportunity to attempt to prove he's healthy enough to play Week 16 against the Falcons will come during Wednesday's practice.
</div>

### 🟢 Tyler Allgeier (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Allgeier had logged eight or more carries in four of his last five appearances heading into Week 15, but he played just 17 percent of the offensive snaps versus Tampa Bay, his lowest share since Week 3. He'll look to get more involved behind Bijan Robinson again in Week 16, when the Falcons will travel to Arizona on Sunday, Dec. 21.
</div>

### 🟡 David Njoku (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 Evan Engram (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The absence of Pat Bryant (hamstring) shifted targets in the Denver offense, though Engram remained in a peripheral role. He made his lone catch late in the third quarter, though it helped keep a drive alive that ultimately resulted in a touchdown. While Engram will retain a significant snap count in the Denver offense, he's been held to 15 or fewer receiving yards in four of the team's last six games.
</div>

### 🟢 Brian Thomas Jr. (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Thomas capped the opening drive with a four-yard touchdown catch. Trevor Lawrence threw four more touchdown passes, but each of those went to running backs. Jakobi Meyers had five more receiving yards than Thomas while tying for the team lead in targets, but both receivers have been productive the past couple games while catching passes from the locked-in Lawrence. Thomas will face a tough test in Week 16 against Patrick Surtain and the Broncos.
</div>

### 🟢 Isiah Pacheco (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Pacheco logged five more carries than backfield mate Kareem Hunt, but neither back made any inroads against a Chargers defense that had often struggled to stop the run this season. Pacheco's carry total was his highest since Week 8, yet he's yet to eclipse 58 rushing yards during the campaign. Pacheco will finish out the regular season without the benefit of the threat Patrick Mahomes (knee) typically poses to opposing defenses, as the talented signal-caller tore his ACL in the fourth quarter of Sunday's game, per Adam Schefter of ESPN.
</div>

### 🟢 Rashee Rice (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Rice tied for the team lead in receptions and set the pace in targets while checking in second in receiving yards. The Chiefs' No. 1 receiver and the rest of his skill-position teammates now have an uncertain outlook for the remainder of the season, given it appears Patrick Mahomes suffered a serious knee injury in the fourth quarter that figures to sideline him the rest of the way. However, even if Gardner Minshew is under center for Kansas City's final three games, Rice figures to remain a top target.
</div>

### 🟢 Ladd McConkey (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> McConkey was once again quiet in the gritty road win, finishing with less than 25 receiving yards for the third time in the last four games. McConkey's muted afternoon was all the more noteworthy considering the absence of Quentin Johnston (groin), and his target tally was his lowest of the season. The second-year wideout will look to exploit an inconsistent Cowboys secondary in a Week 16 road showdown next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 De'Von Achane (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Achane led the Dolphins in both rushing and receiving yards on the night, with his pass-catching work taking center stage in the second half due to Miami's deficit. His rushing workload bumped up by five carries over Week 14 against the Jets, a contest that he left early due to a rib injury, and his receiving yardage total was his second highest of the season behind only his 92-yard effort Week 2 against the Patriots. Achane should remain virtually game-script-proof in a Week 16 home matchup against the Bengals on Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Wan'Dale Robinson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The fourth-year slot receiver connected with Jaxson Dart for a 16-yard TD in the fourth quarter as the Giants tried to mount a late comeback. Robinson has four touchdowns on the season, and two of them have come in the last three games, a stretch in which he's posted a 21-244-2 line on 32 targets. He'll look to keep rolling in Week 16 against the Vikings.
</div>

### 🟡 Tyrod Taylor (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 Adonai Mitchell (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Mitchell got the Jets on the board with a nine-yard touchdown catch in the first quarter. The twitchy wide receiver has been targeted 40 times in five appearances for the Jets. Mitchell has been inconsistent while dealing with subpar quarterback play, but his mix of athleticism and target share will give the 52nd overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft some enticing upside in Week 16 against the Saints, no matter whom the Jets tab as their starting quarterback.
</div>

### 🟢 Baker Mayfield (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Mayfield clawed his way to an impressive yardage total despite finding himself under constant pressure, taking five sacks and seven official hits overall. The veteran signal-caller did clearly benefit from the returns of Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan from injured reserve, as the duo accounted for 170 total receiving yards, with 132 of those coming from Evans. Mayfield's one interception was also particularly critical to the outcome, as it came with 8:28 remaining at the Falcons' 33-yard line and ultimately led to an Atlanta touchdown that narrowed what had been a 28-20 deficit. On the brighter side, Mayfield's yardage total was his best since Week 5, and he'll aim to keep the Buccaneers' playoff hopes afloat with a more efficient performance in a Week 16 road matchup against the Panthers on Sunday, Dec. 21.
</div>

### 🟢 Mike Evans (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Taking the field for the first time since Week 7, Evans looked as good as head coach Todd Bowles had reported the star receiver had during this week's practices. Evans made his first catch for a gain of 12 yards on the Buccaneers' second drive, and he went on to add noteworthy gains of 12 and 33 yards later in the first half. On Tampa Bay's first possession after halftime, the perennial Pro Bowler would go on to add a 45-yard grab, which accounted for half of the yards on a drive that culminated in a Devin Culp six-yard touchdown catch. Evans' receptions, receiving yards and targets were all season highs, and he'll aim to carry over the momentum into a Week 16 divisional road clash against the Panthers on Sunday, Dec. 21.
</div>

### 🟢 Jayden Daniels (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Out<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Quinn said the decision is "part medical, part team," and that Daniels will still practice once cleared to do so. Ian Rapoport of NFL Network reports, however, that upon being medically evaluated Monday, the second-year quarterback was not yet cleared for contact. After an outstanding rookie campaign in 2024, Daniels now concludes Year 2 with just seven regular-season appearances in which he completed 114 of 188 pass attempts for 1,262 yards, eight touchdowns and three interceptions. He also rushed 58 times for 278 yards and two scores. Marcus Mariota will remain Washington's starting QB for the rest of the year, beginning Saturday against the Eagles.
