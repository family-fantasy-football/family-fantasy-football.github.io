## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟡 Emari Demercado (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Demercado didn't return to this Sunday's defeat at Indianapolis after favoring his left ankle while going to the locker room in the second quarter. In the end, Michael Carter (11 touches for 64 yards and no touchdowns on a 44 percent snap share) and Bam Knight (12-54-1 on 51 percent) split the backfield almost evenly Week 6. However, Knight was limited Wednesday due to a knee issue, leaving Carter as the sole healthy running back on Arizona's active roster.
</div>

### 🟢 Michael Penix Jr. (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Penix outdueled Bills star QB Josh Allen (57.7 completion percentage for 180 yards) on the national stage en route to the Falcons' third win of the campaign. Bijan Robinson stole the show on offense with 238 yards from scrimmage, but Atlanta's signal-caller also deserves praise for the upset victory. Penix led an impressive 14-play drive midway through the fourth quarter that ate up most of the remaining clock while deflating Buffalo's hopes of a comeback. The surging sophomore will look to build on a modest two-game win streak when the Falcons take on the 49ers in Week 7.
</div>

### 🟢 Travis Kelce (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Kelce kept the good times rolling with another positive fantasy result following last week's 7-61-1 receiving line. The 35-year-old hasn't posted eye-popping numbers in any particular week, but the consistent production at a shallow position certainly makes fantasy managers' lives easier when constructing weekly lineups. Kelce will continue operating as one of Patrick Mahomes' top and most-trusted targets against the Raiders next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Hunter Henry (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Through six games, Henry has maintained steady playing time while recording a 20-277-3 receiving line on 31 targets. Though his volume has tapered off over his last three outings, the tight end remains a viable red-zone option for QB Drake Maye and a candidate to see increased targets on any given week, when game script and/or game flow dictate.
</div>

### 🟡 Chris Olave (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> It's the first report this season of any limitations in practice, likely reflecting a new injury suffered during Sunday's 25-19 loss to the Patriots. Olave's practice participation at the start of Week 7, even in a limited capacity, suggests he's on track to play this Sunday against the Bears. He's accounted for a whopping 32.2 percent of New Orleans' targets this season, but with meager averages of 8.8 yards per catch and 5.3 yards per target. Olave did finally hit on a big play this past Sunday, catching a deep pass for 53 yards on the first snap of the game against New England.
</div>

### 🟢 Will Shipley (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Shipley hasn't been a significant part of the offense at any point this season for the Eagles, but Thursday represented his season-low snap count. He did not touch the ball on offense but did return one kick for 22 yards.
</div>

### 🟢 DeVonta Smith (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Smith was third across the board to Dallas Goedert and A.J. Brown in receptions, receiving yards and targets on the night, and his overall numbers represented a significant downturn from his season-best effort against the Broncos on Sunday. Smith recorded exactly half of the receptions and targets he had in that contest, while his yardage tally was a sharp decline from the 114 he managed versus Denver. His first opportunity to bounce back will come against the Vikings in a Week 7 road matchup on Sunday, Oct. 19.
</div>

### 🟢 Jalen Hurts (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Hurts and the Eagles offense had a productive first quarter when they netted 10 points as a unit, and the reigning Super Bowl MVP connected with Dallas Goedert from three yards out late in the period for six of those. Hurts would add a one-yard touchdown run at just under the seven-minute mark of the second quarter, and that would surprisingly be the end of the scoring on the night for Philadelphia. Hurts exceeded 30 pass attempts for a second consecutive contest for the first time this season, and he averaged a season-best 8.6 yards per attempt Thursday while connecting with six different targets. The sixth-year pro's one interception also was very costly, however, as it came at the Giants' nine-yard line early in the fourth quarter with the Eagles down 10 and was returned all the way to Philadelphia's 23-yard line to set up the New York's game-clinching touchdown. Hurts has hit or exceeded 280 passing yards in each of the last two games heading into a Week 7 road showdown against the Vikings on Sunday, Oct. 19.
</div>

### 🟢 Kaleb Johnson (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Johnson saw six carries during the Steelers' Week 4 win over the Vikings, and he saw a similar workload following Pittsburgh's Week 5 bye. Jaylen Warren continues to serve as the team's clear lead back, but Johnson has seen slightly more opportunities over the past two games. The 22-year-old's 11 offensive snaps still lagged behind Warren (31) and Kenneth Gainwell (20), and Johnson's fantasy value will likely remain limited as long as those two remain healthy.
</div>

### 🟢 DK Metcalf (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Metcalf remained Aaron Rodgers' top target, leading the team in targets and yards. All four of his catches went for 20 yards or more, highlighted by a 25-yard score down the right sideline to kick off the fourth quarter. Even with an additional missed opportunity for a long touchdown due to an underthrow by Rodgers, Metcalf has found the end zone in each of his last four games and has topped 80 receiving yards in three of five contests to begin his tenure with the Steelers.
</div>

### 🟢 Christian McCaffrey (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> McCaffrey scored his first regular-season touchdown since the 2023 campaign after being held out of the end zone as a runner over his previous five starts this year and all four healthy appearances in 2024. The dual-threat superstar has been in the doldrums as a pure rusher this season (3.1 YPC), but he has offset that with WR1 production as a receiver (46-444-3). In fact, CMC has finished with more receiving yards than rushing yards in five of his six starts this year, highlighting a peculiar start to his game logs. Fantasy managers could care less how their workhorse gets his numbers so long as the overall production is elite, as it has been all season. McCaffrey will likely be asked to continue shouldering the load for the 49ers' offense against the Falcons on Sunday Night Football in Week 7.
</div>

### 🟢 Rachaad White (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> White got the nod in place of injured starter Bucky Irving (foot/shoulder) for the second consecutive week, rewarding fantasy managers with his third touchdown over that span. The 26-year-old White finished below four yards per carry in both spot-starts, but his nose for the goal line helped cement another strong fantasy score. No. 3 RB Sean Tucker (6-25-1) remained a distant second in carries behind White, but the former was able to vulture a touchdown from the fill-in starter this time around. The Buccaneers have an extra day off before hosting the Lions on Monday Night Football in Week 7, so White's managers should monitor Irving's availability leading up to that contest before deciding whether to deploy White in their lineups.
