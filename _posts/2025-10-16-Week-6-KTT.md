## üè• Player Report

### üü¢ Tyler Allgeier (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Allgeier got involved in the box score early with a 21-yard touchdown scamper on Atlanta's opening possession. The talented backup then took a back seat to starter Bijan Robinson, who ripped apart Buffalo's defense to the tune of 238 yards and a score of his own. Allgeier has generated some flex appeal after hitting pay dirt thrice over his last four appearances. There is a four-yard dud nestled in between, so fantasy managers should also be aware of Allgeier's drastic floor ahead of Sunday's tilt against San Francisco.
</div>

### üü° David Njoku (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Njoku appears to be missing a second consecutive practice due to the knee injury he suffered during Cleveland's loss to the Steelers in Week 6, which bodes poorly for his odds of being able to suit up at home against the Dolphins on Sunday even though the issue isn't considered long-term. Zac Jackson of The Athletic reports that Njoku is one of Cleveland's top candidates to be moved ahead of the Nov. 4 trade deadline, which could motivate the team to be extra cautious with the tight end's health. If Njoku indeed can't go Week 7, rookie third-round pick Harold Fannin will benefit from increased target opportunities at the tight end position.
</div>

### üü¢ Troy Franklin (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Franklin's day in London got off to a rubbish start when he coughed up the first fumble of his career on his first reception of the contest. The silver lining for fantasy managers was that the wideout remained involved offensively following the turnover, receiving three more touches in the narrow win. Franklin has shown flashes of upside early in his sophomore campaign, but Sunday's dud is an example of the inconsistency he can exhibit. The 22-year-old's value is likely limited to deeper formats in next Sunday's tilt against the Giants.
</div>

### üü¢ Evan Engram (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Engram led Denver in targets, receptions and yardage in an odd victory that saw No. 1 WR Courtland Sutton finish with just one reception. The 30-year-old Engram also recorded his first rushing attempt of the season, something we haven't seen consistently from the tight end since his early years as a member of the New York Giants. Sunday's solid showing overseas comes on the heels of the veteran tight end's first touchdown of the year against the Eagles last week. Managers in need of help at the tight-end position should take a serious look at the ascending Engram in Week 7 when the Broncos host the aforementioned Giants next Sunday.
</div>

### üü¢ Joe Mixon (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Out<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Caserio's comments during his press conference mark the first time that a member of the Houston brass has addressed Mixon's status since the start of the regular season. The veteran running back was placed on the non-football injury list ahead of training camp after getting hurt during an individual workout in the spring, and the Texans have been non-committal on a timeline for his return ever since. Given that the Texans aren't yet hinting that Mixon will even resume practicing in the near future, the 29-year-old doesn't look like he's on track to be an option in the Houston backfield until late in the season, if at all. The Texans are likely to continue to lean on a timeshare of Nick Chubb and rookie Woody Marks at running back for the foreseeable future.
</div>

### üü¢ Brian Thomas Jr. (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Thomas led the Jaguars' pass catchers across the board in receptions, receiving yards and targets, one-upping the then season-best 80-yard effort he'd posted against the Chiefs on Monday night. The second-year wideout also scored his long-awaited first touchdown of the campaign via a 21-yard grab late in the first quarter that opened the scoring on the afternoon. Thomas has started to find some equilibrium in his production over the last three games, and he'll aim to extend the momentum in a Week 7 matchup against the Rams in London.
</div>

### üü¢ Rashee Rice (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Reid declined to discuss expectations for playing time, saying he isn't sure how many snaps Rice will take. Reid did say that the wideout is in good shape, and ESPN's Jeremy Fowler reports that the Chiefs won't ease Rice back into action. Rice's impressive production to this point in his career means most fantasy managers will want him in lineups, even if there are minor workload concerns for his first game in more than a year. He's coming back from a six-game suspension after completing his rehab from an LCL tear during the offseason. Rice also dealt with a groin injury during the preseason, but there's been no hint of any trouble there since August. He's been allowed at team facilities since Week 4, giving the Chiefs plenty of time to evaluate his conditioning and get him up to speed schematically.
</div>

### üü¢ Isiah Pacheco (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Pacheco finished Sunday's win as the Chiefs' leading rusher, garnering six more touches than veteran backup Kareem Hunt (6-23-0). The 26-year-old Pacheco had been mired in an even timeshare for most of the season, so Sunday's disparity in touches could be something to monitor moving forward. Pacheco would need that hypothetical increase in usage in order to develop into a reliable starting option in fantasy. Until then, treat the physical runner as nothing more than a flex option against the Raiders next Sunday.
</div>

### üü¢ Ladd McConkey (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> McConkey's 42-yard reception on the final possession with under a minute to go was the catalyst for the game-winning field goal just three plays later, but the second-year wideout benefitted significantly in the absence of Quentin Johnston (hamstring) by leading the team in receiving yards, targets and receptions for the first time this season. This kind of workload could be the status quo for the foreseeable future as Los Angeles struggles to deal with a litany of injuries, whether to rookie running back Omarion Hampton (ankle), Johnston or a bevy of injured offensive lineman.
</div>

### üü¢ De'Von Achane (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Achane had been uncharacteristically bottled up by the Panthers in Week 5, but the electric back set an early tone Sunday with a 49-yard breakaway touchdown run with just over four minutes remaining in the first quarter. He'd go on to add a four-yard scoring scamper with just under eight minutes left in the contest, a score that narrowed a 26-13 deficit. Achane eclipsed the century mark for the first time this season with Sunday's production, and his carry total was his second highest through the first six contests. The third-year back should play a key role again during a Week 7 road clash against the tough Browns defense.
</div>

### üü° Darius Slayton (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Slayton injured his hamstring during the Giants' Week 5 loss at New Orleans and hasn't practiced in the meantime, sitting out last Thursday's win against the Eagles in the process. He'll have two more chances this week to mix into drills before New York potentially makes a ruling on his status for Sunday's game at Denver.
</div>

### üü¢ Aaron Rodgers (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Rodgers had one of his better showings of the season, completing five passes of at least 20 yards. Four of those went to DK Metcalf, including a 25-yard touchdown down the right sideline to begin the fourth quarter. Rodgers has had a mixed start to his tenure with the Steelers, though he's averaged over 7.5 yards per attempt in three of five games this season, with Sunday also marking his third multi-touchdown performance of the campaign.
</div>

### üü° Mike Evans (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Bowles said Tampa Bay will continue to monitor Evans throughout the week before making a decision on his availability, or lack thereof, for Monday Night Football against Detroit. If Evans is able to get back on the field Week 7 after having missed the Buccaneers' last three games it will provide a tremendous boost for Baker Mayfield and the passing attack, especially given that both Emeke Egbuka (hamstring) and Chris Godwin (fibula) could be unavailable. The extent of Evans' practice activity Friday and Saturday figure to be crucial, and it won't be surprising if the final word on his status comes down to the wire.
</div>

### üü¢ Baker Mayfield (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Mayfield produced a sterling 139.0 passer rating against a 49ers defense that was helpless after losing LB Fred Warner (ankle) early in the contest. The Buccaneers also suffered a key loss early on when WR Emeka Egbuka (hamstring) exited the game after recording just two receptions. This meant that Mayfield had to finish off the win sans his three top weapons, with Mike Evans (hamstring) and Chris Godwin (fibula) in street clothes Sunday. The 30-year-old Mayfield overcame expectations and produced his fifth multi-score game through six starts. With the Buccaneers visiting the Lions on Monday Night Football in Week 7, it will be important for fantasy managers to note which receivers Mayfield will have at his disposal before making roster decisions.
</div>

### üü¢ Tyler Lockett (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Lockett's snap rate remained depressed for the second straight game, as he was on the field for only 32 percent of offensive snaps. He was still targeted three times, though his lone catch went for no gain. Lockett has posted at least 10 receiving yards in a game only once this season.
</div>

### üü¢ Jayden Daniels (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> As his collection of numbers indicates, it was a mixed bag of a night for Daniels in his second game back from a knee sprain that cost him a pair of contests. The second-year signal-caller threw a season-high three touchdown passes, connecting with Chris Moore (22 yards), Luke McCaffrey (33 yards) and Zach Ertz (six yards) to erase 13-0 and 16-10 deficits. However, Daniels' first-quarter interception, his first of the season, led to a Bears field goal, and his fumble at Chicago's 45-yard line on an attempted handoff to Jacory Croskey-Merritt with 3:10 remaining and Washington clinging to a two-point lead would eventually result in a game-winning field goal by opposing kicker Jake Moody. Daniels also took three sacks, and this was his first multi-turnover tally of the season. The star quarterback and his teammates don't have time to dwell on the last-second defeat, however, as a road date with the arch-rival Cowboys awaits Sunday afternoon.
