## Player Report

#### Marvin Harrison Jr. (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** questionable
#### James Cook III (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Cook enjoyed a solid night on the ground despite game script working against the run as the game unfolded, bouncing back nicely from a 49-yard showing in the Week 5 loss to the Patriots. However, he failed to draw a target for the first time this season after not hauling in the one pass thrown his way Week 5, a relatively rare slump for him as a pass catcher. Cook's fantasy value remains significantly elevated in all formats, however, and he draws a favorable matchup on the road against the Panthers on Sunday, Oct. 26 following Buffalo's Week 7 bye.
#### J.K. Dobbins (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Denver's entire backfield struggled to find running lanes Sunday, with no tailbacks finishing with a per-carry average higher than 3.0 yards in the win. Dobbins still comfortably led the Broncos with 14 rushing attempts, 12 more than rookie backup RJ Harvey. This was easily Dobbins' worst fantasy score of the season after providing managers with five weeks of consistent RB2 production. The veteran starter has an excellent opportunity to get back on track in Week 7 against the Giants, who currently are surrendering 128.8 rushing yards per game thus far this season.
#### Jared Goff (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Goff had an interesting start to the game, as he had a touchdown catch nullified by a penalty on Detroit's opening possession. He was out-dueled by Patrick Mahomes from there, but he still turned in a decent performance, highlighted by three completions at least 20 yards -- including a 22-yard touchdown connection with Jameson Williams. Goff now has multiple scores in each of his last three games.
#### Romeo Doubs (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Doubs was Jordan Love's top target in Sunday's win, leading the team in targets. He converted that into his third performance of 50 or more receiving yards this season, thanks to long gains of 21 and 15 yards. Doubs isn't likely to turn in huge fantasy performances often thanks to the emergence of Matthew Golden and Tucker Kraft, but it's clear he has rapport and the trust of Love, which should be enough to keep Doubs involved in the offense.
#### Matthew Golden (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Golden continues to get more involved in the Green Bay offense, as he's now earned at least five targets in each of his last three games. He was impressive with the opportunity, ripping off long gains of  35 and 31 yards, the latter of which all but clinched a win for the Packers. Golden topped 100 yards from scrimmage for the first time in his career while showcasing his ability to work deep down the field and also pick up yards after the catch. He appears to be earning trust from coaches and Jordan Love, which should lead to more consistent usage as the season progresses.
#### Tyler Warren (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Warren tied Josh Downs for the team lead in receptions and led the way in both receiving yards and targets on an afternoon where he also recorded his second touchdown grab of the season. Warren found the end zone from eight yards out to cap off the opening possession of the game, and he tallied his fifth catch of 20-plus yards this season earlier in the drive with a 23-yard reception. The rookie tight end will continue to serve as a focal point of the offense during a Week 7 marquee road matchup against the Chargers.
#### Travis Hunter (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** After consecutive encouraging performances during which Hunter generated a combined 6-106-0 receiving line on eight targets, the rookie second overall pick was back to a very modest, low-upside role Sunday. All but one yard of Hunter's tally came on one catch, underscoring how he didn't have any sort of downfield profile. Although he developed a well-earned college reputation for being an explosive player who can offer plenty at deeper depths of target than what he's been seeing, Hunter is surprisingly stuck in a limited role despite head coach Liam Coen's typically creative offensive designs.
#### Ashton Jeanty (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Jeanty ground out a solid fantasy day by scoring his third rushing touchdown of the year on a season-high 23 carries. Veteran backup Raheem Mostert (five carries) was the only other rusher to record a touch in the win, highlighting Jeanty's stranglehold on the every-down role out of Las Vegas' backfield. The sixth overall pick from this year's draft has generated 497 combined yards from scrimmage with five total touchdowns through six starts in 2025. Jeanty's offensive involvement has increased with an average of 22.3 touches over the Raiders' last three contests. Fantasy managers can start the Boise State product with confidence for next Sunday's road tilt against the Chiefs.
#### Omarion Hampton (RB)
**Injury Status:** Injured Reserve <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Chargers head coach Jim Harbaugh didn't provide many details about the injury Hampton sustained in the Week 5 loss to the Commanders, but the fact that the promising rookie is expected to need more than four weeks to make a full recovery points to him likely nursing a high-ankle sprain. A target date for Hampton's return has yet to be established, but because the Chargers have a bye coming up in Week 12, the team could be motivated to hold him out through that period to give him ample time to heal. Garafolo notes that Hassan Haskins is likely to serve as the Chargers' lead back Sunday in Miami while practice-squad signee Kimani Vidal also sees work, but Los Angeles is also expected to be in the market for a running back ahead of the Nov. 4 trade deadline to compensate for the long-term injuries to Hampton and Najee Harris (Achilles).
#### Ollie Gordon II (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Gordon once again struggled to display efficiency while operating as the Dolphins' top reserve backfield option, while starter De'Von Achane gashed Los Angeles with 16 carries for 128 rushing yards (8.0 YPC) and two scores, adding four grabs for 22 yards in the receiving game (six targets). At this stage, Gordon retains fantasy value purely as a handcuff in deeper formats, as his availability has rendered Jaylen Wright a healthy scratch. The rookie sixth-round pick faces a rough matchup on the road against Cleveland in Week 7.
#### Jaxson Dart (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Dart recorded the first signature win of his nascent career with a standout, mistake-free performance. The dynamic rookie got off to a blistering start by helping lead two first-quarter touchdown drives, possessions he capped off with a 20-yard scoring run and a 35-yard strike to Wan'Dale Robinson. Dart went on to lead three more scoring drives in the upset, and he navigated a brief third-quarter exit to be checked for a concussion to finish out the upset victory without incident. Dart has already shown considerable promise in his first three starts while recording a pair of victories in the process. but he'll get quite the test in a Week 7 road matchup against the Broncos on Sunday, Oct. 19.
#### Jake Tonges (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Tonges continued doing his best George Kittle (hamstring) impression in another effective spot-start Sunday. The 25-year-old Tonges has been a pleasant surprise in fantasy during his brief run as the starter, posting a 25-223-3 receiving line through six games. David Lombardi of SFStandard.com reported that Kittle could return from injured reserve in Week 7, which would effectively end Tonges' run of utility. Managers should wait until Kittle is officially activated before making any rash decisions regarding Tonges in Week 7 and onward.
#### Mac Jones (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Jones toughed out a pair of injuries and another week of limited practices in order to start for a shorthanded 49ers squad Sunday. The veteran backup was unable to earn his fourth win in as many appearances with San Francisco, but he did produce a season-high 347 passing yards for fantasy managers. The Alabama product is averaging a whopping 313.0 yards per game with a 2:1 TD:INT in place of starter Brock Purdy (toe/shoulder) this season. The latter's status is currently unclear for Week 7, but Jones has certainly played well enough in Purdy's stead to warrant fantasy consideration if he remains under center against the Falcons for Sunday Night Football.
#### Chig Okonkwo (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Okonkwo's six targets Sunday tied his previous season high, while the six grabs set a new high-water mark through six starts. Aside from a one-catch dud in Week 4, the veteran tight end has carved out a consistent role in the passing game. Okonkwo will carry a 23-218-0 receiving line into next Sunday's tilt against the Patriots.
#### Elic Ayomanor (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Ayomanor produced his third underwhelming performance in a row as the Titans returned to their losing ways in 2025. The lack of production from the rookie is especially concerning considering that No. 1 wideout Calvin Ridley (hamstring) left the contest early and did not return. Van Jefferson (4-75-0) wound up taking advantage instead and finished as Tennessee's leading receiver. That said, if Ridley is forced to miss next Sunday's tilt against the Patriots, Ayomanor may have a prime opportunity to return to the form that made him a hot pickup early in the campaign.
