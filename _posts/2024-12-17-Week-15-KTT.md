## Player Report

#### Kyle Pitts (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The struggling tight end saw a welcome uptick in involvement, even as that came accompanied with a modest receiving yardage total. Pitts' catch and target totals were both team-high figures, and both the reception and yardage tallies also were his best since Week 10. Pitts will look to carry over the momentum into a Week 16 home matchup against the Giants.
#### Drake London (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** London led the Falcons in receiving yards and scored the team's only touchdown on a 30-yard grab in the first quarter. The talented wideout's trip to the end zone was his first since Week 9, and he was able to eclipse 50 receiving yards for the fifth consecutive contest. London did see a big drop in targets after garnering 26 looks over the previous two games, but Kirk Cousins threw only 17 times overall on the night. London next takes aim at a Giants defense that just gave up five touchdown passes to Lamar Jackson when New York visits Atlanta in Week 16.
#### Josh Allen (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** One week after a record-setting six-touchdown performance, Allen and his juggernaut of an offense actually one-upped themselves in terms of total points. Allen himself fell short of his unforgettable Week 14 effort against the Rams, but he strengthened his MVP case with a mistake-free day that featured a season-high passing yardage total and his third consecutive multi-touchdown-pass tally. Allen's work on the ground was no less impressive, and his one- and four-yard rushing scores in the first quarter were his fourth and fifth over the last pair of contests. Ryan O'Halloran of The Buffalo News reports that Allen fell on his right throwing shoulder late in the contest and was briefly examined, but he confirmed in his postgame conference that he'd been cleared after an evaluation, per 
#### C.J. Stroud (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Stroud salvaged a performance that featured his second-lowest passing yardage total of the season with a pair of six-yard touchdown passes to Nico Collins in the second and third quarters, respectively. Otherwise, the talented second-year signal-caller scuffled against an aggressive and talented Dolphins defense that sacked him four times. Stroud has a pair of multi-touchdown-pass efforts within a three-game span for only the second time all season heading into a Week 16 Saturday afternoon road showdown against the Chiefs.
#### Jonathan Taylor (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Taylor broke free for what should have been a 41-yard touchdown in the third quarter, but he celebrated early and dropped the ball before crossing the goal line, resulting instead in a fumble that rolled out of the end zone for a touchback. That mistake was the turning point, as the Broncos responded with 24 unanswered points to drop the Colts to 6-8. It also kept Taylor stuck at five rushing touchdowns, the most recent of which came in Week 8. On the bright side, he managed to exceed 100 rushing yards for the fifth time in 11 appearances this season. The workhorse running back should maintain a heavy workload in Week 16 against the 3-11 Titans.
#### Kareem Hunt (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Hunt co-led the Chiefs in carries, tying backfield mate Isiah Pacheco in that category while drawing one more target than the latter. It was an interesting development following the Week 15 division of labor between the two, which saw Pacheco outpace Hunt in rush attempts by a 14-5 margin. Whether it's a one-week outlier or indicative of a stickier trend remains to be seen, but Hunt did outgain Pacheco, who was making only his third appearance since returning from an extended stay on IR due to fractured fibula, by 13 rushing yards.
#### DeAndre Hopkins (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Hopkins finished second in receptions and receiving yards on the afternoon for the Chiefs, although the latter total was particularly unremarkable. Hopkins has at least four catches in four straight games, but he's been under 40 receiving yards in four of his last five contests overall. Hopkins could continue to struggle with efficiency in a Week 16 home matchup against the Texans on Saturday afternoon if Patrick Mahomes (ankle) is forced to miss the contest and is replaced by Carson Wentz.
#### Jakobi Meyers (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** The Raiders tried to tap into Meyers' prior experience as a quarterback with an early trick play against Atlanta, but that plan backfired and resulted in a drive-killing sack. The versatile wideout had a solid receiving night all things considered, leading the Raiders in both targets and yards Monday. Meyers carries a high floor into a soft matchup against the Jaguars on Sunday.
#### Zamir White (RB)
**Injury Status:** Injured Reserve <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** White's placement on IR rules him out for Las Vegas' final four games of the regular season, after the 2022 fourth-round pick had already missed the last three games due to a quad injury. Despite entering the season as the team's No. 1 running back, White managed just 183 yards (2.8 YPC) and one touchdown on 65 carries while also securing six of eight targets for 30 yards. Alexander Mattison (ankle) and Sincere McCormick remain available atop the Las Vegas depth chart.
#### T.J. Hockenson (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Hockenson played third wheel in the air attack to Justin Jefferson and Jordan Addison, but the veteran tight end still turned in a solid line that featured his second-highest catch total since Week 10. Hockenson also drew the second-most targets of any of his first seven games since his delayed season debut, and he should once again garner a fair amount of Sam Darnold's attention in a Week 16 road trip to Seattle.
#### Davante Adams (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Adams was blanked on two first-half targets as Aaron Rodgers completed only three passes before halftime, but the veteran wideout secured a 12-yard reception on the first play of the second half and took over from there. Adams made a 43-yard catch on New York's second possession of the third quarter and added a one-yard touchdown catch three plays later after having a touchdown ruling reversed on a red-zone reception in between. That touchdown reception was the 100th of Adams' career and gave the Jets a 17-16 lead. Adams celebrated the occasion by adding an octopus in the fourth quarter, putting the Jets up 23-22 with a career-long 71-yard touchdown catch before extending the advantage to three points by catching the ensuing two-point conversion. To round out this memorable performance, Adams made a sensational 23-yard catch along the sideline followed by a 41-yard reception to set up Breece Hall's game-winning one-yard rushing touchdown with 1:05 remaining. After the best half of Adams' illustrious career, he'll look to put on an encore against the Rams in Week 16.
#### George Pickens (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** questionable
#### Sterling Shepard (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Shepard played through the foot issue that had hampered him during the practice week, but he took a back seat to Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan during the high-scoring win. However, Shepard still logged a solid 32 snaps and remains firmly entrenched in the No. 3 receiver role heading into a Week 16 road matchup against the Cowboys.
#### Bucky Irving (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Irving was listed as questionable ahead of last Sunday's win over the Raiders and ultimately suited up, but he was limited to just 10 snaps before exiting the game early when his back tightened up. He's followed a similar practice progression this week compared to last, but his condition has reportedly improved. Though Irving should be cleared to play in advance of Sunday's 4:25 p.m. ET kickoff, he will be difficult to trust in the fantasy playoffs while he faces a tough road matchup.
#### Will Levis (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Levis was benched during Tennessee's 37-27 loss to the Bengals in Week 15 after accounting for four turnovers (three interceptions and one lost fumble). He otherwise completed eight of 12 passes for 89 yards and zero touchdowns. Rudolph looked more competent, if unremarkable, in relief of Levis, completing 21 of 26 passes for 209 yards with two touchdowns and one interception, while also rushing twice for 14 yards. In order to properly divvy up first-team reps, the Titans may make an official decision at the quarterback position for Week 16 prior to Wednesday's practice.
#### Brian Robinson Jr. (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Robinson struggled as a runner Sunday, averaging  just 3.1 yards per carry despite tying his season high in carries (21). The 25-year-old helped offset his inefficient rushing day with the second-highest yardage total as a receiver through 11 active games this year. Robinson will continue to lead Washington's backfield as the team prepares to host Philadelphia next Sunday.
#### Zach Ertz (TE)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Ertz was checked for a head injury in the second quarter before the Commanders made a ruling on his availability for the rest of Week 15. He'll finish the contest with two catches (on two targets) for 25 yards. John Bates and Ben Sinnott will handle TE reps for Washington in the second half and potentially beyond that point.
