## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Trey McBride (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The 134 yards were a career high for McBride, while the two scores got him to 10 on the season, the first time he's reached double digits. Those milestones paled in comparison to the new NFL records for tight ends he set with the performance -- he's the first TE in history with consecutive 100-reception seasons, and he's caught at least five passes in 16 straight games, breaking the mark of 15 straight held by Travis Kelce. McBride almost certainly isn't done yet in 2025, either. With 105 catches and three games to go on the season, he has Zach Ertz's NFL tight-end record of 116 receptions firmly in his sights. McBride will look to take a step closer to that piece of history in Week 16 against the Falcons.
</div>

### 🟢 Chuba Hubbard (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Hubbard looked to be regaining momentum in the Carolina backfield, but he operated as a clear secondary option to Rico Dowdle in Sunday's loss. Hubbard managed only nine touches compared to 17 for Dowdle, and he's now been held below 50 yards from scrimmage in six of the Panthers' last seven games.
</div>

### 🟢 Kyle Monangai (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Monangai split carries evenly with D'Andre Swift throughout the first half, accounting for eight of his 11 carries. However, Swift saw nine carries in the final two quarters as opposed to only three for Monangai. While he's still seen double-digit carries in five consecutive games, it appears clear that Swift remains the lead back in Chicago, meaning Monangai will be reliant on finding the end zone and rushing efficiency to put up viable fantasy performances. He didn't do either in Sunday's blowout win, leading to a disappointing stat line.
</div>

### 🟢 Joe Burrow (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Taylor dismissed the notion that Cincinnati might consider sitting Burrow to preserve his health, in spite of the fact that the team's 24-0 loss to Baltimore in Week 15 closed the door on any chances of a playoff berth. "We want to win," Taylor said. Burrow missed nine games due to a turf toe injury before returning to action on Thanksgiving Day, when he earned a win against the Ravens, but the Bengals then lost to the Bills before he struggled mightily during the team's most recent matchup against Baltimore. He'll work to both close out the year strong and avoid any injuries during Cincinnati's next three matchups, beginning Sunday on the road against Miami.
</div>

### 🟢 Ja'Marr Chase (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The big yardage day was bittersweet for Chase, as he didn't connect with Joe Burrow on a couple of key early plays, including one where he was open deep but Burrow checked down short of the sticks on a third-down play. With Tee Higgins (concussion) missing the game, Chase was targeted frequently but also drew the Ravens' constant attention on defense. The elite wideout's outlook for the rest of the season will be heavily dependent on whether the Bengals deem it wise to keep Burrow active now that they've been officially eliminated from postseason contention.
</div>

### 🟢 David Montgomery (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Montgomery was able to reach the end zone for the third straight week, plunging in for a one-yard score in the fourth quarter. The running back has now gone five straight games without double-digit carries after having reached at least 11 totes in seven of the team's first nine contests of the year. Montgomery has turned 136 carries into 635 yards and eight touchdowns while catching 21 of 26 targets for 164 yards over 14 games this season.
</div>

### 🟡 Christian Watson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Watson was forced out of Sunday's road loss to Denver and taken to a hospital for evaluation, though he was cleared to join his teammates for the return flight to Green Bay. It's a piece of welcome news for the Packers that Watson seemingly won't endure a long absence, but the explosive wideout now faces a short recovery window leading up to Saturday's key road divisional matchup against the Bears. In the event that Watson isn't able to get healthy in time for Week 16, Matthew Golden, Dontayvion Wicks and Bo Melton could see increased roles alongside Romeo Doubs and Jayden Reed.
</div>

### 🟢 Dalton Schultz (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The eight grabs and nine targets led the Texans, and Schultz capped his big performance with a four-yard TD grab from C.J. Stroud in the third quarter. It was just the second touchdown of the season for the veteran tight end, but Schultz has caught at least six passes and topped 50 receiving yards in five of the last seven games, posting a 38-342-2 line on 53 targets over that stretch. He'll look to deliver strong numbers again in Week 16 against the Raiders.
</div>

### 🟢 Josh Downs (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Downs caught Philip Rivers' first touchdown pass following a five-year layoff on an eight-yard connection in the second quarter. Outside of scoring the only touchdown for either team, Downs had another quiet performance as Rivers threw for only 120 yards. Following Daniel Jones' season-ending Achilles injury, the Colts' passing game has lost most of its fantasy appeal heading into a MNF home game against the 49ers on Dec. 22.
</div>

### 🟢 Travis Etienne Jr. (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Etienne more than made up for a modest performance on the ground by recording touchdown receptions of 20, eight and 45 yards. The first of those three scores came 21 seconds before halftime, and Etienne scored once each in the third and fourth quarters. Etienne has been a key part of Jacksonville's recent surge, with nine total touchdowns over the team's last six games heading into a Week 15 road matchup against Denver's stout defense.
</div>

### 🟢 Matthew Stafford (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Stafford shook off the interception he threw on the Rams' opening drive in order to lift his current club to victory over the team that took him first overall in the 2009 NFL Draft. It was the third time this season that the veteran gunslinger eclipsed 350 passing yards as he continues to show no signs of slowing down. The only concern lies with star WR Davante Adams (hamstring), who aggravated his nagging hamstring injury in the fourth quarter and did not return to the contest. If Adams is unable to make the short turnaround for Thursday's tilt against the Seahawks, then Stafford may be forced to lean heavily on WR Puka Nacua in a tough road environment for Week 16.
</div>

### 🟢 Rhamondre Stevenson (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Stevenson played second fiddle to TreVeyon Henderson, who turned 14 carries and three targets into 161 scrimmage yards, including touchdown runs of 52 and 65 yards. Henderson has emerged as the clear No. 1 option in New England's backfield down the stretch, and this was only the third time that Stevenson reached the 50-yard threshold on the ground in 11 appearances this season. Stevenson will likely continue to cede most of the touches to Henderson in Week 16 against the Ravens.
</div>

### 🟢 A.J. Brown (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Brown was a non-factor for most of the afternoon, but the talented wideout made his presence felt with 14- and 27-yard grabs, the latter a scoring reception on the first play of the fourth quarter. Brown saw a three-game streak of 100-yard efforts snapped and posted his lowest catch total since Week 10, but he's now scored four times in the last three games heading into a Week 16 road matchup against a beatable Commanders secondary on Saturday afternoon.
</div>

### 🟢 Cooper Kupp (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Kupp failed to replicate last week's trip to the end zone, but he still finished with his best receiving totals since Week 10 against Arizona (2-74-0). The former WR1 in fantasy has been anything but during his late-stage tenure with Seattle, posting a 41-519-2 receiving line across 13 active games. Perhaps the aging superstar can elevate his game against his former club when the Seahawks host the Rams on Thursday Night Football in Week 16.
</div>

### 🟢 Sam Darnold (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Darnold struggled to get Seattle's offense over the hump in the opponent's red zone, resulting in a franchise-record six field goals being made in Sunday's narrow victory. The 28-year-old didn't leave fantasy managers empty-handed after accruing his highest passing total since Week 11 against the Rams. Darnold will actually face the Rams again in Week 16 on Thursday Night Football. The Seahawks are hoping that their quarterback won't see any ghosts this time around after throwing four interceptions in a losing effort when the NFC West rivals met earlier this season.
</div>

### 🟢 Jaxon Smith-Njigba (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Smith-Njigba recorded his ninth 100-plus yard game of the season as he continues to terrorize opposing defenses. The 23-year-old currently sits four receptions shy of hitting the 100-catch mark in consecutive seasons. Despite nearly matching last year's total, JSN has already outproduced his sophomore campaign by 411 yards and three touchdowns in three fewer appearances. Smith-Njigba will continue being the focal point of Seattle's offense in an NFC West showdown against the Rams on Thursday Night Football in Week 16.
