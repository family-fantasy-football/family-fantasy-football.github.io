## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Tyler Allgeier (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Allgeier got involved in the box score early with a 21-yard touchdown scamper on Atlanta's opening possession. The talented backup then took a back seat to starter Bijan Robinson, who ripped apart Buffalo's defense to the tune of 238 yards and a score of his own. Allgeier has generated some flex appeal after hitting pay dirt thrice over his last four appearances. There is a four-yard dud nestled in between, so fantasy managers should also be aware of Allgeier's drastic floor ahead of Sunday's tilt against San Francisco.
</div>

### 🟡 David Njoku (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 Evan Engram (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Engram duplicated his production from a week ago on two more targets against New York's other football club in Week 7. The veteran tight end has quietly generated value for those in PPR formats by averaging 4.5 receptions in his past four starts. Engram will provide fantasy managers with a high floor in a soft matchup against the Cowboys next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟡 Brian Thomas Jr. (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Despite the fact that the Jaguars were playing from behind pretty much the entire game, Thomas finished third on the team in targets behind Travis Hunter (8-101-1 on 14 targets) and Parker Washington (4-52-0 on 10 targets). Thomas checked in and out of the lineup in the second half due to what seemed to be multiple nagging injuries, and he was eventually removed completely due to an apparent right shoulder issue late in the fourth quarter. The second-year wideout will have the Jaguars' Week 8 bye to get healthy, but through seven games he sports a disappointing 27-365-1 line on 55 targets.
</div>

### 🟢 Isiah Pacheco (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Pacheco logged a season high in both rush attempts and rushing yards. He still wasn't particularly efficient, though he did manage three rushes of seven yards -- one of which went for his first touchdown of the season. Kareem Hunt was beat up during the game, which could have propped up Pacheco's volume. While Hunt was able to return, it will be worth monitoring his status for a Week 8 matchup against the Commanders, as Pacheco could be in for a larger workload.
</div>

### 🟢 Rashee Rice (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Rice made his season debut after recovering from a serious knee injury while also serving a six-game suspension. He immediately regained his role as Patrick Mahomes' favorite pass catcher, as Rice led the team with 10 targets and seven receptions. Rice's work all came close to the line of scrimmage -- his longest catch of the day went for only 12 yards -- but his performance was made with a pair of scores from two and three yards away. The Chiefs were able to run a conservative offensive game plan for the entire second half, so Rice should be in for bigger performances moving forward, even considering his strong season debut.
</div>

### 🟢 Ladd McConkey (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The second-year wideout set new season highs in targets and receptions, although the increased volume didn't result in increased production -- McConkey finished third on the Chargers in receiving yards behind rookie tight end Oronde Gadsden (7-164-1 on nine targets) and Keenan Allen (11-119-1 on 14 targets), while Quentin Johnston was on the other end of Justin Herbert's third TD. It's been a disappointing sophomore campaign so far for McConkey, but he's posted a 21-206-2 line on 31 targets over the last three games, giving him momentum heading into a Week 8 clash with a Vikings secondary that just surrendered a combined 13-304-3 line to A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith.
</div>

### 🟢 De'Von Achane (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Dolphins' point total and the fact Tua Tagovailoa managed only 100 passing yards while throwing three interceptions essentially tells the tale of the type of day it was for Miami's offense as a whole. Therefore, Achane's solid numbers served as the one bright spot for Mike McDaniel's squad, and the speedy running back gained well more than half his total on a 46-yard run late in the first quarter. Achane has rattled off 210 rushing yards and a pair of Week 6 rushing touchdowns on 29 carries over his last two games, but the Dolphins' reeling offensive unit faces an unenviable Week 8 road matchup against the Falcons next Sunday afternoon.
</div>

### 🟡 Darius Slayton (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 Wan'Dale Robinson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Robinson paced the Giants in receptions and yardage for the second week running, this time also surpassing Lil'Jordan Humphrey in targets. The 24-year-old Robinson is now averaging 5.7 receptions and 69.7 yards in three games since taking over for for Malik Nabers (knee) as the Giants' top wideout. Robinson provides enough upside in his current role to warrant flex consideration against the Eagles next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Aaron Rodgers (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Rodgers was outshined by fellow veteran signal-caller Joe Flacco, but the former still tied a season high in touchdown passes. Rodgers connected with Pat Freiermuth for half his scoring tosses -- from 19 and 68 yards out -- and his other two TD strikes went to Freiermuth's position mates Jonnu Smith (10 yards) and Darnell Washington (two yards). Rodgers made several impressive throws throughout the night, including the second touchdown to Freiermuth and his game-ending Hail Mary attempt, corroborating he still has plenty of arm strength and continues to demonstrate his mostly difficult 2024 season with the Jets may have just been a hiccup. Rodgers and his teammates will next turn their attention to a Week 8 home showdown against the Packers on Sunday night, Oct. 26.
</div>

### 🟢 Mike Evans (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Out<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Evans suffered the injury in the second quarter of Monday's loss while attempting to reel in a deep target. His absence will be a big blow to the Tampa Bay receiving corps, with Chris Godwin (leg) also banged up. Evans' streak of 11 straight campaigns with 1,000 receiving yards will also almost certainly come to an end.
</div>

### 🟢 Baker Mayfield (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Mayfield went into the game with both Mike Evans and Emeka Egbuka available despite their respective hamstring injuries, but he ended up losing the former to a shoulder injury -- which  Rick Stroud of the Tampa Bay Times reports was subsequently diagnosed as a broken collarbone -- and a concussion in the first half. Mayfield had already been struggling to get the ball to Evans considering the pass on which he suffered the pair of injuries was his fourth target without a catch, and the veteran signal-caller displayed only modest improvement over the rest of the night even though the Lions were playing with an extremely short-handed secondary. Mayfield saw a two-game interception-less streak come to an end as well on a controversial play that originally appeared to be a Cade Otton reception, and it remains to be seen if he'll at least have Chris Godwin (fibula) at his disposal to help offset the loss of Evans in a Week 8 road matchup versus the Saints on Sunday.
</div>

### 🟡 Jayden Daniels (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Daniels' MRI on Monday came back clean after he was injured on the opening drive of the second half of Sunday's loss to the Cowboys. He wanted to go back in the game against Dallas, but the score was already somewhat lopsided, so the Commanders kept him out and let Marcus Mariota play the bulk of the second half. If Daniels is unable to play against Kansas City, Mariota would likely draw the start.
