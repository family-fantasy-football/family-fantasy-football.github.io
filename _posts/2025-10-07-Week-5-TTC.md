## Player Report

#### Bryce Young (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Carolina managed to pull off a comeback from a 17-0 deficit, but Young had an uneven day that included three sacks in addition to his two turnovers. Rico Dowdle also helped carry the offense with his 206-yard, one-touchdown effort, but Young played a key part with a seven-yard touchdown pass to Xavier Legette that kickstarted the rally late in the first half, and he added a four-yard toss to Mitchell Evans that proved to be the game-winning score. Young has thrown for under 200 yards in all but one game this season, so even with the encouraging team result for the Panthers on Sunday, he remains a somewhat shaky fantasy option even in a favorable Week 6 home matchup against the Cowboys.
#### Rico Dowdle (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Stepping into the lead-back role in place of Chuba Hubbard (calf), Dowdle exceeded all expectations in his first opportunity to helm the ground attack in Carolina. Dowdle repeatedly knifed the Dolphins' front seven for big gains, including 43- and 53-yard scampers. Dowdle's otherworldly performance raises an intriguing dilemma for head coach Dave Canales whenever Hubbard is healthy again, but the Panthers can certainly afford to give the latter time to fully heal, especially with Dowdle next getting a crack at the inconsistent defense of his former Cowboys squad in a Week 6 home matchup.
#### Chase Brown (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** The Bengals were scripted out of the run game early on, as they were down by multiple scores for three quarters of the game. Brown had another uninspiring game as a rusher as a result, though he did earn his most involvement as a pass catcher this season. The end result won't provide any reassurance for fantasy managers moving forward, but Brown did deliver a serviceable performance in PPR formats.
#### Jerry Jeudy (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** There was some optimism for Jeudy's outlook with the Browns making a quarterback switch to Dillon Gabriel, but Jeudy instead posted his lowest yardage total in a game this season. Even worse was that he was out-targeted by both David Njoku and Isaiah Bond on an offense that isn't likely to sustain many fantasy-viable pass catchers. This was a tough spot for the Cleveland offense due to travel overseas and a stiff defensive matchup, so Jeudy could be in for a better showing in Week 6 against Pittsburgh.
#### CeeDee Lamb (WR)
**Injury Status:** Out <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** out
#### Dak Prescott (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** For the second straight game, Prescott chucked multiple TDs without having CeeDee Lamb (ankle) on the field, this time hitting Jake Ferguson twice and George Pickens and Javonte Williams once each. Prescott has a 7:0 TD:INT over the last two contests, and Sunday's performance may have been even more impressive considering four of the Cowboys' five starting offensive linemen were sidelined. The veteran QB figures to keep rolling in Week 6 against a Panthers defense that just gave up three passing TDs to Tua Tagovailoa.
#### RJ Harvey (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Harvey remained the clear No. 2 RB behind J.K. Dobbins, who logged 20 carries. Harvey did continue enjoying a bigger role in the passing game than his veteran teammate, but he was at his most productive in his returner role. As long as Dobbins remains healthy and productive, Harvey projects to remain in the same complementary role that's afforded him 8.6 touches per contest heading into a Week 6 matchup against the Jets in London next Sunday.
#### Brenton Strange (TE)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Strange suffered the injury in the first half, and he was briefly checked in the medical tent and spotted riding a stationary bike. He never appeared close to returning thereafter, as he was seen on the sideline without his helmet to begin the second half. The severity of the injury is not yet clear.
#### Xavier Worthy (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Worthy popped up on the Week 5 injury report after being a full participant in practice when he experienced swelling in his ankle on the flight to Jacksonville. The speedy wideout was able to finish Monday's loss in good health, but it's worth noting that he left the contest briefly to have his ankle examined after getting tackled on one of his six receptions. The injury scare comes just one week after Worthy returned from a shoulder injury that cost him two games of action. Kansas City's offense is clearly more explosive when Worthy is on the field, so managers are hoping for a clean bill of health heading into a potential shootout against the Lions on Sunday Night Football in Week 6.
#### Patrick Mahomes (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** The highlight that will make the rounds for Mahomes following Monday's game will unfortunately be the interception he threw at the Jaguars' one-yard line that LB Devin Lloyd returned 99 yards the other way for a touchdown. The Chiefs' signal-caller had a strong fantasy night aside from his blunder in the third quarter, eclipsing the 300-yard mark as a passer for the first time this season. Mahomes also finished as Kansas City's leading rusher while scoring his third touchdown on the ground in five starts, just one shy of his career-best mark of four set back in 2022. The 29-year-old will have to move past Monday's sloppy loss in order to prepare for another primetime showdown Week 6 when the Chiefs host the Lions on Sunday Night Football.
#### Darren Waller (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Waller made a splash with a two-touchdown effort in a Week 4 win over the Jets, a game that marked his first regular-season action since the 2023 season. With Tyreek Hill (IR, knee) going down for the season in that contest, Waller figured to see his opportunity rise exponentially beginning with Sunday's game, and that came to fruition. While the majority of the veteran tight end's production came in the first half, Waller still finished second in receptions and receiving yards for Miami on the afternoon while adding a four-yard scoring grab early in the second quarter. Waller figures to remain a key figure in the air attack during a Week 6 home matchup against the Chargers next Sunday.
#### Stefon Diggs (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Diggs saved his best performance of the season to date for the bright lights of Sunday Night Football in a win over one of his former clubs. The 31-year-old star wideout cracked the century mark in receiving yards for the second consecutive week after totaling just 112 yards over his first three appearances with New England. A lack of touchdowns lingers as the only flaw in Diggs' 2025 fantasy resume, but his recent game log proves that he still can produce at an elite level. Diggs should be treated as a WR1 in fantasy when the Patriots visit the Saints next Sunday.
#### Tyrone Tracy Jr. (RB)
**Injury Status:** Out <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Tracy returned to practice last Friday and appears to be nearing a return after missing the Giants' past two contests following his shoulder injury Week 3 against the Chiefs. During Tracy's absence, Cam Skattebo has started each of the last two games and has totaled 40-138-0 rushing and 8-56-0 on nine targets out of the backfield. Skattebo lost a critical fumble at the goal line in Sunday's loss to the Saints and hasn't shown enough to slam the door on Tracy regaining his role as the team's RB1 upon his return.
#### Cam Skattebo (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** The rookie RB topped 100 scrimmage yards for the second time in the last three games, but Skattebo's performance was marred by a lost fumble in the red zone that New Orleans safety Jordan Howden returned 86 yards for a TD -- the third of five straight Giant possessions that ended in a turnover. Skattebo is locking down the top job in the New York backfield while Tyrone Tracy (shoulder) is sidelined, and over those last three contests he's racked up 315 scrimmage yards and a rushing touchdown. Even if Tracy remains on the shelf in Week 6, Skattebo will face a tough test against the Eagles.
#### Bucky Irving (RB)
**Injury Status:** Out <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** out
#### Chris Godwin Jr. (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Godwin saw his efficiency improve from the 30 percent catch rate he posted in his return from injury last week. Unfortunately for fantasy managers, his target count dropped dramatically from the 10 he garnered against the Eagles in Week 4. Godwin's return from an ankle injury sustained in Week 7 of the 2024 season has come along slowly, dampening expectations for the veteran until we see a true return to form. The Buccaneers could still be without top wideout Mike Evans (hamstring) in Week 6, which would keep Godwin in the starting lineup against the 49ers next Sunday.
