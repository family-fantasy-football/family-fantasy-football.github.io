## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Khalil Shakir (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Shakir led the Bills in targets and receptions while trailing only Dalton Kincaid (6-101-1) in receiving production Sunday. The 25-year-old Shakir was unable to replicate last week's trip to the end zone, but he still provided a solid score for those in PPR formats. Shakir will carry a 38-399-3 receiving line into next Sunday's tilt against Miami, providing a managers with a reliable flex option for Week 10.
</div>

### 🟢 Harold Fannin Jr. (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The rookie led the Browns in receptions, targets and yards while hauling in a 18-yard TD from Dillon Gabriel in the first quarter. Fannin and fellow tight end David Njoku have emerged as the most reliable downfield options for Gabriel, as wide receivers accounted for just three of his 21 completions on the afternoon. Fannin will take a 38-352-2 line on 51 targets through eight games into a Week 9 bye before facing the Jets in Week 10.
</div>

### 🟢 Jake Ferguson (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Following a rare Week 8 blanking against the Broncos, Ferguson bounced back Monday night to finish third across the board in receptions, receiving yards and targets for the Cowboys. The talented tight end did lose a fumble deep in Cardinals territory just past the halfway point of the second quarter, however, and although the turnover didn't directly lead to any points for Arizona, it certainly robbed Dallas of a scoring opportunity. Ferguson has at least five receptions in all but two games and a career-high six touchdown catches heading into the Week 10 bye, but he's also averaging a career-low 6.9 yards per grab.
</div>

### 🟢 George Pickens (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Pickens had a shaky night in terms of ball security, but he made up for it by recovering one of his fumbles and also finishing second across the board to CeeDee Lamb in receptions, receiving yards and targets. Pickens has proven an excellent fit in the Cowboys' air attack over the first half of his debut campaign in Dallas, as he'll head into the Week 10 bye with four straight tallies of 78 receiving yards or more and a 49-764-6 receiving line overall.
</div>

### 🟢 Jahmyr Gibbs (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Gibbs' final line underscores the stellar job the Vikings defense managed to do containing him all afternoon, and the third-year pro's yardage totals were both his second lowest of the season. Ironically, Gibbs was coming out of the Week 8 bye fresh off his best game of the season (218 total yards and two rushing TDs) versus the Buccaneers in Week 7, and he'll look to return to that caliber of production in a Week 10 road matchup against the Commanders.
</div>

### 🟢 Woody Marks (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The rookie split the workload with Nick Chubb almost equally, but neither RB was able to gain much yardage. Marks has seen double-digit carries in three straight games, compiling 104 rushing yards on just 3.4 yards per carry and adding a 7-69-1 line on 12 targets, and he's not making much of a case to pass Chubb on the depth chart completely. The Texans saw C.J. Stroud (concussion) leave Sunday's game early, and if he gets replaced under center by Davis Mills in Week 10, it could mean a bigger emphasis on the ground attack against the Jaguars.
</div>

### 🟢 Daniel Jones (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jones looked to be on his way to another efficient day, as he went 5-for-9 for 73 yards and a rushing score on the Colts' first possession. However, he struggled with negative plays for much of the game, taking five sacks in addition to his five turnovers. Jones managed to pad his stats with a few long drives in the fourth quarter, one of which concluded with a four-yard touchdown pass to Josh Downs. This marked Jones' first significant struggle of the season, and he'll now lead the Colts into a Week 10 matchup against the Falcons.
</div>

### 🟢 Michael Pittman Jr. (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Colts faced a multi-score deficit for nearly the entire second half, forcing them to a pass-heavy offense. That benefited Pittman, who saw a season-high 12 targets and converted that into both his highest receptions and yardage totals of the campaign. Much of Pittman's production came in garbage time in the fourth quarter -- 65 of his 115 yards came in the last 12 minutes of game time -- but he took advantage of his opportunity in a mostly underwhelming offensive performance for the Colts.
</div>

### 🟢 Bhayshul Tuten (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The rookie fourth-round pick tied his season high with 10 offensive touches and scored the third touchdown of his NFL career with a one-yard run in the fourth quarter, though starting running back Travis Etienne still dominated the backfield work with a season-high 27 touches. Fellow rookie tailback LeQuint Allen actually played 22 offensive snaps compared to Tuten's 20 but received just two touches. Tuten should continue to operate as Jacksonville's No. 2 running back but doesn't offer much fantasy upside with Etienne still receiving the lion's share of the opportunities.
</div>

### 🟢 Tre' Harris (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The 2025 second-round pick played 30 offensive snaps and hauled in both of his targets during the Week 9 win. His role on the Chargers' offense has slowly expanded as the year has progressed, and Harris has now logged far more offensive snaps than Keenan Allen (72 to 42) over the two three weeks. Expect Harris to remain involved heading into the Week 10 matchup against the Steelers.
</div>

### 🟢 Justin Herbert (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Herbert accounted for the majority of his production in the first half, racking up 186 yards on 20 attempts through two quarters. He was efficient throughout the game, completing five passes of 20 yards while also tossing for scores of 19 and two yards. While Herbert was limited as a passer in the second half due to game script, he managed to punch in his third touchdown of the contest with a one-yard rushing score early in the fourth quarter. Herbert now has multiple touchdowns in four consecutive matchups heading into a Week 10 game against Pittsburgh.
</div>

### 🟢 Davante Adams (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Adams made the most of his five receptions, turning in two catches of at least 20 yards while also finding the end zone twice. This marked his second consecutive game with multiple touchdowns and only the third time this season he's reached at least 60 receiving yards. While Adams has been reliant on finding the end zone to maintain his fantasy value, the Rams remain one of the more efficient passing offenses in the league with heavily concentrated targets. He could also be in for additional volume in Week 10 against the 49ers if Puka Nacua (chest) is forced to miss additional time.
</div>

### 🟢 T.J. Hockenson (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Hockenson played on 48 of the offense's 62 snaps and went out for a pass on 28 of them, which was about his usual pattern. However, quarterback J.J. McCarthy attempted just 25 passes, which didn't leave a lot of targets for the receiving corps after Justin Jefferson (nine targets). It's promising that McCarthy looked for Hockenson in the red zone.
</div>

### 🟢 Drake Maye (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Maye threw a 16-yard touchdown pass to DeMario Douglas in the first quarter and added an 11-yard touchdown pass to Stefon Diggs in the second quarter to produce the second-year quarterback's eighth multi-touchdown passing performance of the season. He was picked off in the third quarter, moving Maye's TD:INT to 17:4. Maye and the surging Patriots will take a six-game winning streak into their Week 10 trip to Tampa Bay, which is one of the toughest tests on New England's historically easy schedule.
</div>

### 🟢 Alvin Kamara (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Kamara was completely stonewalled and had a season low in yards while also tying his season low for carries in a game. Instead, Taysom Hill led the team with 30 rushing yards on four carries. Kamara also fumbled on his final carry of the game in the fourth quarter. The ninth-year running back didn't see an uptick in usage even with rookie quarterback Tyler Shough making his first career start, as the Rams dominated the Saints in time of possession 43:53-16:07. Over the last five games, Kamara has now averaged 8.2 carries for 24.2 yards. He also hasn't scored a touchdown since Week 1. Kamara's production is well below his reputation as a bell-cow back in fantasy, and his lack of explosiveness and limited production will likely continue to limit his output going forward. The Saints next face off with the Panthers in Week 10 on Sunday.
</div>

### 🟡 Ricky Pearsall (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
