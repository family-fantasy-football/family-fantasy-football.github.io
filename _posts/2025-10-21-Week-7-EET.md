## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Drake London (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> London logged double-digit targets for the fourth time in six games this season, so lack of opportunity wasn't the reason for his poor line. However, he struggled to connect with Michael Penix both deep and in short areas of the field, leading to his inefficient day and his lowest yardage total of the campaign. The Falcons' passing game appeared to be getting on track in Weeks 5 and 6, making this a particularly disappointing step back.
</div>

### 🟢 Justice Hill (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Ravens ran a run-heavy offense as long as possible, giving Hill a chance to mix in on possessions to relieve Derrick Henry. Hill saw a season-high six carries as a result, but he made a more significant impact as a pass catcher. His usage could change with the anticipated return of Lamar Jackson (hamstring) after the team's bye, but Hill has at least three catches in four of six games on the campaign.
</div>

### 🟡 Joshua Palmer (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Palmer was forced out of the first half of Monday's 24-14 loss to the Falcons with an ankle injury, finishing the night with two receptions for 60 yards. Though Palmer may have been hard-pressed to make it back to the field if the Bills played on Sunday this week, he'll benefit from Buffalo being on bye for Week 7. The wideout will still need to resume practicing in some fashion during Week 8 to have a chance at playing in the Bills' next game Oct. 26 versus the Panthers.
</div>

### 🟢 Courtland Sutton (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Sutton got back on track after being held to just 17 receiving yards against the Jets in London last week. The 29-year-old helped play the role of hero when he corralled a 22-yard pass from QB Bo Nix on the penultimate play before a game-winning field goal from kicker Wil Lutz. Sutton has been providing WR2 production for fantasy managers with a 33-469-3 receiving line through seven weeks. Consider the physical wideout a plus play for next Sunday's tilt against a porous Dallas pass defense.
</div>

### 🟢 Trevor Lawrence (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Jaguars were staring at a 21-0 deficit at halftime, so Lawrence was forced to put the ball in the air most of the second half. The volume led to a season high in passing yards for the fifth-year QB, as well as Travis Hunter's first career TD reception, but it also led to Lawrence being sacked seven times. He'll take a mediocre 9:5 TD:INT through seven games into Jacksonville's Week 8 bye.
</div>

### 🟢 Hollywood Brown (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Brown made an early impact in the game, hauling in an eight-yard touchdown to put the Chiefs up 14-0. He was a non-factor after that, mixing in for similar target volume with all of the Chiefs' pass catchers except Rashee Rice. Brown could pop up for decent performances throughout the rest of the season, but the return of Rice will make it difficult for Brown to retain the consistent involvement in the offense he enjoyed in the early part of the campaign.
</div>

### 🟢 Jakobi Meyers (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Out<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Meyers missed his first game of the season during Las Vegas' blowout 31-0 loss to the Chiefs in Week 7 while Bowers hasn't played since Week 4, but the Raiders anticipate having both pass catchers back in the lineup versus Jacksonville on Sunday, Nov. 2 in Week 9. Trade rumors have also surrounded Meyers in recent weeks, and back in late August he in fact requested to be dealt elsewhere by Las Vegas. The team's midseason respite could provide a space for the Raiders to explore options on that front prior to the NFL's trade deadline on Tuesday, Nov. 4, but as long as he remains on the roster, Meyers projects to resume handling his usual starting role moving forward.
</div>

### 🟢 Rashid Shaheed (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Shaheed was the surprise leader in targets on the afternoon for New Orleans while curiously posting four catches for the sixth consecutive game. The speedy fourth-year pro has just two catches of more than 20 yards this season after compiling five in just six 2024 games before his campaign was cut short. The way Spencer Rattler is being asked to manage the offense certainly has something to do with that downturn, but Shaheed should remain a steady contributor in a Week 8 home matchup against the Buccaneers next Sunday afternoon.
</div>

### 🟢 Saquon Barkley (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> In addition to being stymied on the ground yet again, Barkley also suffered an injury scare when he exited the game briefly in the second half to be evaluated for a concussion. Barkley eventually returned to the contest, but he finished with under 60 rushing yards for the fifth straight game. Barkley had a long run of just nine yards as well, and the inefficient afternoon was especially disappointing considering he quickly netted 16 yards on his first three carries during the Eagles' opening drive. The 2018 first-round pick will look for a resurgent outing at the expense of his former Giants squad in a Week 8 divisional clash next Sunday afternoon.
</div>

### 🟡 Brock Purdy (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🔴 George Kittle (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> It was a Christian McCaffrey focused gameplan out of the gates Sunday, resulting in no San Francisco receiver topping 31 yards in the win. Kittle's managers were hoping for more after he spent the last five-plus weeks tending to his injured hamstring on IR. The star tight end didn't appear limited while running routes, which is the only silver lining from Sunday's bagel in the box score. Kittle will look to get more involved offensively against the Texans next Sunday for a 49ers squad that is still banged-up at the receiver position.
</div>

### 🟢 Tony Pollard (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Pollard slipped into an even workload with Tyjae Spears on the ground, though the Titans attempted only 12 rushes as a team. Instead, Pollard earned most of his fantasy value as a pass catcher, with six catches marking his highest total since Week 14 of the 2023 campaign. While it was a positive for Week 7, the likelihood of Pollard repeating this performance in the passing game consistently moving forward is slim. Given the state of the Titans' offense and the split in workload, Pollard has lost much of his fantasy appeal since Spears has returned.
</div>

### 🟢 Zach Ertz (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Ertz was one of the few bright spots on either side of the ball for the Commanders in the blowout loss. The veteran starter cashed in his second touchdown in as many weeks, bringing his season receiving line up to 23-229-4 in seven appearances. Ertz showed no limitations from the shoulder injury that plagued him during the practice week, setting him up for another start against the Chiefs on Monday Night Football in Week 8.
