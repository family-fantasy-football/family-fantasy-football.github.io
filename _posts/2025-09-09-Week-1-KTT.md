## Player Report

#### David Njoku (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Njoku was projected to be Joe Flacco's second target behind Jerry Jeudy, but he was overshadowed by several Browns' pass catchers. The most notable was rookie tight end Harold Fannin, who drew rave reviews during the preseason and carried that into the regular season with nine targets. It's likely that Njoku retakes a larger role in the offense moving forward, but Flacco's distribution of targets in Week 1 was concerning.
#### Evan Engram (TE)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Engram injured his calf in the fourth quarter of his Broncos debut. Prior to getting hurt, the veteran tight end had three catches for 21 yards on four targets. Adam Trautman and Lucas Krull are the two remaining healthy options dressed at the position, with Nate Adkins (ankle) inactive.
#### Brian Thomas Jr. (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** It was a frustrating start to his second NFL season for Thomas, but he salvaged his day with a TD on an end-around in the second quarter. Better days will be ahead for the LSU product as the Jaguars adjust to new coach Liam Coen's scheme, but the 1-11-0 line is already worse than Thomas had in any game as a rookie. He'll look for bigger volume and better production on the road Week 2 against the Bengals.
#### Isiah Pacheco (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** The Chiefs were down by a touchdown after one quarter and trailed throughout, which played a part in Pacheco seeing a modest workload. Additionally, backfield mate Kareem Hunt matched Pacheco's carry total, while Patrick Mahomes paced the Chiefs with both his six rush attempts and 57 rushing yards. Despite Friday's usage, Pacheco still profiles as Kansas City's top running back heading into a Week 2 Super Bowl rematch with the Eagles at Arrowhead Stadium on Sunday, Sept. 14.
#### De'Von Achane (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Achane was certainly efficient on the ground, but his opportunities were capped by a surprising game script that saw the Colts already ahead by a 20-0 margin at halftime. The speedy back did offer underwhelmed fantasy managers some solace with his fourth-quarter 11-yard touchdown reception, and more opportunities on the ground should be available in a Week 2 home matchup against the Patriots.
#### Kendre Miller (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Miller operated as the No. 2 running back behind longtime starter Alvin Kamara, who paced the Saints' ground game with 11 carries for 45 yards and a touchdown. Meanwhile, third-string running back Devin Neal rounded out the ground game with two carries for nine yards. The overall lack of reliance on the rushing attack was a departure from the approach under last year's offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak, as quarterback Spencer Rattler instead tossed a career-high 46 passing attempts. Both Miller and Neal also played under a dozen offensive snaps, with 11 and seven, respectively. The lack of playing time and the minimization of the rushing game don't bode well for any running back playing behind Kamara this season. It will be worth monitoring if offensive-minded head coach Kellen Moore employs a similar approach during the Week 2 matchup versus San Francisco.
#### Darius Slayton (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Slayton was targeted by Russell Wilson just once on a day when the Giants' new quarterback heaved 37 total passes. Malik Nabers got a hefty amount of opportunities, as expected, with 12 targets, while Wan'Dale Robinson was pretty active with eight. Wilson completed just 17 of his 37 attempts for 168 yards, and if he continues to struggle the team may eventually turn to rookie Jaxson Dart, but head coach Brian Daboll confirmed Monday that Wilson will be the Week 2 starter Sunday in Dallas, per Adam Schefter of ESPN. With that in mind, Slayton doesn't project to be an appealing fantasy target for that contest.
#### Wan'Dale Robinson (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Robinson averaged 41.1 yards on 8.2 targets per game in 2024, so his Week 1 stat line wasn't far from his customary production. Whether the Giants stick with veteran Russell Wilson in Week 2 against the Cowboys or turn to rookie first-round pick Jaxson Dart under center after Sunday's ugly performance on offense, Robinson will continue to offer a high floor due to his significant involvement on short passes but have a limited ceiling due to his lack of downfield contributions.
#### Aaron Rodgers (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The Steelers offense wasn't as efficient as the point total suggests -- the unit averaged only 5.4 yards per play-- but Rodgers averaged 8.1 yards per attempt and made up for an ineffective ground game. He often got the ball out of his hands quickly, with DK Metcalf and Calvin Austin excelling after the catch. Rodgers also did plenty on his own to take down his former team, delivering touchdowns from 22, 18, five and three yards away to four different receivers. It was an excellent debut with Pittsburgh for Rodgers, and he'll now lead the team into a Week 2 matchup against Seattle.
#### Baker Mayfield (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Mayfield was considerably less efficient than usual while facing a feisty Falcons defense in a rowdy dome environment, but after some early struggles, the veteran signal-caller was able to awaken the Buccaneers offense with a 30-yard scoring strike to rookie Emeka Egbuka. Mayfield would subsequently connect with Bucky Irving from nine yards out in the third quarter, and he capped off what turned out to be a rewarding fantasy day with a critical 25-yard touchdown toss to Egbuka with just under one minute remaining to erase a 20-17 deficit. Mayfield also finished as Tampa Bay's leading rusher, and his quick chemistry with Egbuka bodes well heading into a tough Week 2 road matchup against the Texans on Monday night, Sept. 15.
#### Mike Evans (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Evans recorded team-high catch and target totals while finishing second in receiving yards to rookie position mate Emeka Egbuka. However, it was the latter and Bucky Irving who ended up on the receiving end of Baker Mayfield's three touchdown passes, leaving Evans with a solid but relatively muted season-opening line. The perennial Pro Bowler could be due for an even bigger workload in a Week 2 road showdown against the Texans on Monday night, Sept. 15.
#### Tyler Lockett (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Lockett was on the field for 33 offensive snaps (58 percent), less than rookie Elic Ayomanor. Lockett was also an afterthought in the offense, with his only target coming on the fourth play of the game. The Titans' passing offense should have more success in future weeks, but Lockett doesn't look to be a priority target.
#### Austin Ekeler (RB)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** The Commanders held a walkthrough Monday on the heels of Sunday's 21-6 win over the Giants. In that contest, Ekeler logged 33 of a possible 70 snaps on offense, while carrying six times for 26 yards and catching all three of his targets for 31 yards. Now that he's managing a shoulder issue, however, Ekeler's status should be tracked ahead of Thursday night's game against the Packers. If he's available, Ekeler would be in line to continue to share backfield work with Jacory Croskey-Merritt (10 carries for 82 yards and a touchdown Sunday) and Jeremy McNichols (four carries for 25 yards). Of the the trio, Ekeler was the only one to record a catch Week 1.
#### Jayden Daniels (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Daniels gave the Commanders a 7-0 lead with a seven-yard touchdown pass to Zach Ertz in the first quarter, and Washington took a 14-3 lead into the locker room, but it could have been larger if not for an intentional grounding penalty on Daniels from the Giants' four-yard line that resulted in a half-ending 10-second runoff. Washington's defense continued to stifle the Giants in the second half, so Daniels wasn't asked to do too much, though he still topped the 60-yard rushing mark for the seventh time in 18 regular-season NFL starts. Daniels' ability to contribute with both his arm and legs makes the second-year pro an elite fantasy option heading into Thursday's Week 2 trip to Green Bay.
