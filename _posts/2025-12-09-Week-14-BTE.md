## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 DJ Moore (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Targets were expected to condense around Moore and Luther Burden with Rome Odunze (foot) sidelined, but Moore was completely uninvolved. His three targets matched his season low, while his only catch came late in the second quarter. Moore now has under 20 receiving yards in four of Chicago's last five games.
</div>

### 🟡 Tee Higgins (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> As a result, Higgins is back in the NFL's concussion protocol, which clouds the wideout's status for the Bengals' Dec. 14 contest against the Ravens. After sustaining a concussion Nov. 23, Higgins was inactive for Cincinnati's Thanksgiving Day contest against Baltimore. He then gained clearance to play in Sunday's 39-34 loss to the Bills, en route to logging a 73 percent snap share and catching six of his 11 targets for 92 yards and two touchdowns. If Higgins ends up sidelined this weekend, Andrei Iosivas and Mitchell Tinsley would be in line to see added Week 15 snaps behind top WR  Ja'Marr Chase.
</div>

### 🟢 C.J. Stroud (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Stroud led the Texans to consecutive scoring drives late in the first quarter and into the second quarter, during which he completed long passes of 46 and 53 yards while also capping a touchdown drive with a nine-yard pass to Woody Marks. He didn't muster much production thereafter, as Houston's only additional score came on a short field as the result of a turnover of downs by Kansas City. Positively, Stroud did not turn the ball over and helped Houston continue to surge toward a playoff spot, though he has only one total touchdown in two games since returning from a concussion.
</div>

### 🟢 Juwan Johnson (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The veteran tight end finished with modest production yardage-wise, but he did produce a team-high reception total. Johnson also finished second in receiving yards on a low-volume day for the air attack, but he now has at least four catches in six of the last seven contests going into a Week 15 home matchup against the Panthers next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Tyler Shough (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Shough took three sacks and generated the third sub-200-yard tally through the air of his six-game starting tenure, but the rookie signal-caller shined with his work on the ground. Shough recorded the first two rushing scores of his career on 34- and 13-yard runs, the latter play coming with 8:26 remaining in the game and snapping a 17-17 tie. Shough also established a new career high in rushing yardage in the upset victory, and his penchant for keeping the Saints competitive most weeks affords him a reasonably optimistic outlook for a Week 15 home divisional clash against the Panthers.
</div>

### 🟢 Devin Singletary (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Singletary made his mark on Monday Night Football when he lined up in the Wildcat formation and ripped off a 22-yard score on the first play of the fourth quarter. The 27-year-old finished as the game's leading rusher a week after being overshadowed by backfield mate Tyrone Tracy. The latter finished with 33 net yards on 11 touches Monday, but Tracy also left the game in the fourth quarter with a hip injury and didn't return. Singletary has quietly entered the mix as a flex option in standard fantasy formats after recording double-digit carries in three straight games while hitting pay dirt thrice over that span, but if Tracy misses any time, the former would increase his value further. The Giants will be on a bye next week and resume play against the Commanders on Sunday, Dec. 14 in Week 15.
</div>

### 🟢 Breece Hall (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Miami stacked the box without fear and focused on containing Hall after Tyrod Taylor's first-half groin injury forced third-string quarterback Brady Cook into action for the Jets. Hall's 43 scrimmage yards marked his lowest total since Week 2, and he could struggle to find running room against Jacksonville's stout run defense in Week 15, especially if the Jets don't get either Taylor or Justin Fields (knee) back at quarterback. With four games remaining in the regular season, Hall needs 123 rushing yards to secure the first 1,000-yard rushing season of his four-year NFL career.
</div>

### 🟢 Dallas Goedert (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Goedert was finally unleashed on Monday Night Football after being held to two catches in three consecutive starts. The 30-year-old finished with his best receiving line since posting season highs in receptions (nine), yards (110) and targets (11) against the Giants back in Week 6. Goedert's sporadic usage in 2025 makes him hard to trust on a weekly basis, but Monday's outburst should inspire some hope in fantasy managers for Sunday's tilt against the Raiders.
</div>

### 🟢 Calvin Austin III (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Austin was held without a catch last week against Buffalo for the first time in the 2025 campaign, but he bounced back in Week 14 by logging a deep reception in the third quarter. The 2022 fourth-rounder has been inconsistent this year, but he's recorded double-digit receiving yards in five of his last seven appearances, securing 17 of 19 targets for 170 yards during that time. Austin hasn't found his way into the end zone since Week 3, however.
</div>

### 🟢 Roman Wilson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Steelers added Adam Thielen and elevated Marquez Valdes-Scantling from the practice squad this week, giving their wide-receiver corps some depth. That pushed Wilson down the depth chart, though the team opted to make Scotty Miller active ahead of him, after Miller had previously been a healthy scratch. This will mark Wilson's first missed game of the season.
</div>

### 🟢 Kendrick Bourne (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Bourne was targeted for the first time since Week 10 in Sunday's road victory, but he failed to haul in his only opportunity across 23 snaps played on offense (34 percent). The veteran wideout has been relegated to No. 4 on the depth chart ever since Ricky Pearsall returned from a knee injury Week 11. Bourne should remain a fantasy afterthought when the 49ers return from the upcoming bye week to face the Titans on Sunday, Dec. 14.
</div>

### 🟢 Jauan Jennings (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Both passing attacks struggled to deal with high winds in Cleveland, but Jennings was able to get on the other end of a Brock Purdy seven-yard TD pass in the fourth quarter. It's the fifth-year wideout's fourth score in the last five games, a stretch in which Jennings has put together a 23-246-4 line on 33 targets. He'll get a chance to rest during next week's bye before the 49ers host the Titans in Week 15.
</div>

### 🟢 Zach Charbonnet (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Kenneth Walker saw a team-high 10 carries, but it was Charbonnet's 46 rushing yards that paced the Seahawks, and the 66 scrimmage yards represented his best performance since Week 10, Seattle's backfield remains a timeshare, but Charbonnet's nose for the end zone has made him the more reliable fantasy option -- he's got eight rushing TDs through 12 games, while Walker's scored only four. Charbonnet will look to hit paydirt again in Week 15 against the Colts.
</div>

### 🟢 Kenneth Walker III (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> While he led the Seahawks' backfield in touches, Walker found little running room and Zach Charbonnet wound up pacing the team with 46 rushing yards. It was Walker's lowest yardage output since Week 1, but he has just one rushing TD over the last 10 games, managing 599 rushing yards on 4.6 yards per carry over that stretch. He'll try to break out in Week 15 against the Colts.
</div>

### 🟢 Terry McLaurin (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The 41 receiving yards actually led the Commanders on the day, as neither Jayden Daniels (elbow) nor Marcus Mariota had much success against the Minnesota defense. In two games since his own return from a quadriceps strain, McLaurin has caught 11 of 20 targets for 137 yards and a TD, and he's locked in as Washington's top wideout whether Daniels -- who appeared to aggravate his dislocated left elbow in the loss -- or Mariota is under center in Week 15 against the Giants.
