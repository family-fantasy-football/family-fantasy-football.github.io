## Player Report

#### James Conner (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Conner re-established himself as Arizona's lead back Sunday after Trey Benson led the team in rushing in Week 1. The latter received just three carries with most of his work coming in the passing game, while Conner handled a team-high 11 carries and hit pay dirt for the second time in as many weeks. Both talented backs figure to remain involved moving forward, but fantasy managers who roster Conner have to be relieved seeing the workload distribution tip back in his favor. The Cardinals' next matchup comes against the 49ers next Sunday in a battle of 2-0 NFC West squads.
#### Zay Flowers (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Flowers once again filled the role of a true No. 1 receiver, leading the way in receptions, receiving yards and targets for the Ravens. While he matched his Week 1 catch total, Flowers didn't come close to approximating his 143-yard tally and didn't get into the end zone. However, Baltimore naturally wasn't pressed to be anywhere near as aggressive through the air as in that season-opening game, and the Flowers-Lamar Jackson connection appears to be in prime form going into a Week 3 home showdown against the Lions on Monday night, Sept. 22.
#### Derrick Henry (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** The offense ran through Lamar Jackson and his pass catchers Sunday, as the star signal-caller finished with four touchdown passes and turned in a turnover-free performance. In contrast, Henry was consistently bottled up, and considering eight of his yards came on one carry, he truly found next to no running room throughout the afternoon. After a spectacular first three-plus quarters of the new season, Henry's fortunes have taken a turn for the worse beginning with his critical fumble in the final quarter of the Week 1 loss to the Bills. His next opportunity to reverse course will come in a Week 3 home interconference clash against the Lions on Monday night, Sept. 22.
#### Rashod Bateman (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** It was a disappointing outing for Bateman in such a high-scoring affair, but he did manage to finish second in targets among Baltimore receiving options. The 2021 first-round selection posted a career best 45-756-9 receiving line for the Ravens in 2024, so there is hope that the No. 2 wideout can produce better numbers than what we saw in Sunday's loss. Bateman's next opportunity to cash in that potential comes in a home matchup against the Browns next Sunday.
#### Josh Allen (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Allen came out for the final two plays of the first quarter but returned to start the second quarter with gauze in his nose. After putting the team on his back in Week 1 against the Ravens, Allen let his defense and running game do most of the work in this one before resting for the final two possessions as backup Mitchell Trubisky mopped up. With the Bills averaging 36.0 points per game heading into Thursday's home game against the Dolphins, Allen's ceiling remains sky-high, even if he doesn't always have to bring his A-game to win.
#### Ray Davis (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Davis played just 10 of the Bills' 85 offensive snaps Sunday, behind starter James Cook (48) and Ty Johnson (28). With so many playmakers in Buffalo, the second-year running back should continue to struggle to earn meaningful touches out of the backfield barring an injury to Cook. With that said, Davis remains a high-value insurance policy for fantasy purposes. The 25-year-old will have his next opportunity to get involved when the Bills visit the Jets in Week 2.
#### Cedric Tillman (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Tillman snagged a five-yard pass on a crossing route in the back of the end zone for Cleveland's lone touchdown. He also had one of three fourth-quarter drops by Browns receivers. His drop with 1:24 remaining was the dagger, as it bounded off his hands and into the arms of the Bengals' DJ Turner. Despite the drop, a lot went right in Week 1 for Tillman, who saw good target volume and had a 25-yard reception. After flashing in the middle of the 2024 season, a concussion ended his year after Week 12 and left his status for 2025 up in the air. Tillman enters the season as the No. 2 wideout opposite Jerry Jeudy, and nothing that transpired Sunday will change that.
#### Sam LaPorta (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** LaPorta had led the Lions' pass catchers in the Week 1 loss to the Packers, posting a 6-79-0 line on nine targets. LaPorta's numbers were therefore down across the board Sunday, but Jared Goff spread the ball more than he had against Green Bay. LaPorta's production will inevitably fluctuate from game to game given the number of weapons on Detroit, but he'll remain in play for a Week 3 road showdown against the Ravens on Monday night, Sept. 22 that could be a very tightly contested affair.
#### Amon-Ra St. Brown (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** St. Brown comfortably led the Lions in receptions and targets while edging Jameson Williams for the top spot in receiving yards as well. While his speedy teammate got that runner-up spot largely via a 64-yard chunk play, St. Brown chipped away at the Bears secondary throughout the afternoon with short and medium gains, including touchdown grabs of four, eight and four yards. The two-time All-Pro's breakout performance was a welcome departure from his modest 4-45-0 receiving line Week 1 against Green Bay, and St. Brown's contributions figure to be critical again when the Lions tackle the unenviable task of a road trip to Baltimore for a Week 3 Monday night showdown with the Ravens on Sept. 22.
#### Najee Harris (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** After getting in limited practice reps throughout training camp and the preseason while recovering from a superficial eye injury, Harris took on a light role in the Chargers' Week 1 win over the Chiefs, playing just 18 percent of the offensive snaps and logging two touches (one carry, one catch). However, with the longer turnaround for the Week 2 matchup allowing Harris to get further ramped up, the veteran continued to handle a reserve role but ended up poaching more work from rookie first-round pick Omarion Hampton in Monday's victory. While Hampton continued to pace the Chargers backfield in playing time by taking the field for 36 of 58 offensive snaps (62 percent share), he mustered just 24 yards on eight carries and had one catch for one yard. Harris wasn't much more efficient with his opportunities on the ground, but he still nearly doubled up his snap share from the season opener, taking the field for 20 plays (34 percent). Hampton will likely get another chance to lead the backfield during Sunday's game against Denver, though Harris is still expected to have a role in the game plan and could end up seeing his snap share tick up a little more after marginally outperforming the rookie in Week 2.
#### Keenan Allen (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Allen continues to be Mr. Reliable for Justin Herbert, capitalizing on a nifty bit of scrambling by the quarterback in the second quarter to toe tap in the back of the end zone for another touchdown in as many weeks. While the veteran may have lost a shade of elusiveness after the catch, Allen's crafty route running is turning into the ultimate safety blanket and has arguably cut into Ladd McConkey's (five catches on five targets for 48 yards) seemingly airtight projected volume to kickstart the 2025 campaign.
#### Cam Ward (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Ward struggled with efficiency for the second consecutive week, averaging only 5.3 yards per attempt. However, he showed off his playmaking ability while connecting with Elic Ayomanor for his first pro touchdown after scrambling for several seconds before throwing across his body for a nine-yard score. Ward also completed three passes of more than 20 yards, two of which went to Calvin Ridley, which was also an improvement over Week 1. Ward isn't trustworthy for standard fantasy formats yet, but he did seem to take a step forward in his second pro start.
#### Jacory Croskey-Merritt (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Ekeler played nearly half of the offensive snaps and logged 19 touches through the first two games, so his absence leaves a massive opportunity. Croskey-Merritt looks like the favorite to claim the bulk of those duties, but veteran running back Jeremy McNichols should play a role in the passing game while Chris Rodriguez -- who was a healthy scratch for the first two games -- may mix in too. Through two games, Croskey-Merritt rushed 14 times for 99 yards (7.1 YPC) and a touchdown but failed to haul in either of his two targets.
