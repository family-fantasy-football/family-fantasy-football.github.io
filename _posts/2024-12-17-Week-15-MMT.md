## Player Report

#### Trey Benson (RB)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Benson suffered an ankle injury in the second half, bringing his day to a close after he turned five carries into 22 yards against New England. In his absence, James Conner will continue to handle the lion's share of touches at running back in Week 15.
#### James Cook (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Cook got in on the fun of the Bills' second straight 40-plus-point barrage, crossing the goal line on the ground from six and 41 yards out in the second and third quarters, respectively. The third-year pro has two of his three 100-yard efforts on the season within the last three games, and his receiving yardage total Sunday was his highest since Week 3. Cook draws a highly favorable matchup against the Patriots at home in Week 16.
#### Xavier Legette (WR)
**Injury Status:** Doubtful <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Canales said he would "love to have a chance for [Legette] to finish the season strongly," but the rookie first-round pick is expected to miss at least one contest due to the groin injury he sustained during Carolina's 30-14 loss to the Cowboys in Week 15. If Legette indeed isn't able to suit up versus Arizona,  Adam Thielen, Jalen Coker and David Moore will be positioned as Bryce Young's clear top wide receivers, with Deven Thompkins acting in the No. 4 role.
#### CeeDee Lamb (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Lamb was peppered with targets throughout the game, as he accounted for 116 of Cooper Rush's 214 passing yards. He delivered long gains of 28 and 20 yards, while also finding the end zone from 14 yards away to tally the Cowboys' first touchdown of the game. Most importantly, Lamb looked to be healthier after being slowed by a shoulder injury for the last several weeks.
#### Sam LaPorta (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Several of Detroit's primary pass catchers posted inflated stat lines as Jared Goff was forced to take to the air 59 times in negative game script. LaPorta delivered his best yardage total of the season as a result, highlighted by long gains of 31 and 22 yards to record the second 100-yard performance of his career. The Lions aren't likely to be down multiple scores often for the rest of the campaign, making this an outlier performance, though it was positive to see LaPorta finish second on the team in targets.
#### Dontayvion Wicks (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Wicks tied Tucker Kraft for second in targets and Christian Watson for the team lead in receptions, although he was a distant second to the latter in receiving yards. Nevertheless, it was notable that Wicks logged four more targets than No. 1 receiver Jayden Reed, who went without a catch. Wicks has back-to-back four-reception outings heading into a Week 15 road matchup against the Seahawks on Sunday night, Dec. 15, but he could be looking at a reduced role if Romeo Doubs (concussion) returns for that game.
#### Hollywood Brown (WR)
**Injury Status:** Injured Reserve <br>
**Lineup Slot:** IR <br>
**Details:** A previous report suggested it would happen either Friday or Monday, after Chiefs coach Andy Reid confirmed earlier this week that Brown was almost ready to practice. Brown won't play against Cleveland this Sunday and might be viewed as a long shot for Week 16, but it seems he'll return before the end of the regular season unless he suffers a setback in practice. There's now a 21-day window in which Brown can practice without being activated to the 53-man roster.
#### Justin Herbert (QB)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Herbert has been dealing with ankle and thigh issues for the last couple weeks, and he appeared to aggravate the ankle in Sunday's loss to the Bucs, though he missed just one offensive snap. The limited start to the week would suggest Herbert has a good chance to suit up Thursday night against the Broncos. If Herbert isn't cleared to play, Taylor Heinicke would likely draw in as the starter.
#### DeMario Douglas (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Douglas came out of New England's bye week in good health and rewarded deep-league managers with his second touchdown of the season. The sophomore starter has quietly provided value for those in PPR formats with a 55-508-2 receiving line through 14 games. With his ankle injury in the rearview mirror, Douglas remains serviceable to those in the aforementioned formats against the Bills next Sunday.
#### Rhamondre Stevenson (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Stevenson spearheaded the Patriots' rushing attack Sunday, grinding out 85 total yards for fantasy mangers in yet another loss. The Oklahoma product received double-digit carries for sixth time over his last seven appearances while backup Antonio Gibson chipped in seven rushing attempts for 33 yards. Stevenson has quietly posted a decent fantasy campaign (193-740-6) despite being a north-south runner on an 11-loss team. Things won't get any easier for Stevenson and the Patriots as the team heads back to the east coast to face the Bills next Sunday.
#### Drake Maye (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Maye scored a pair of garbage-time touchdowns in the fourth quarter to help pad his fantasy line, but the rookie couldn't avoid throwing an interception for the sixth week in a row. The North Carolina product now owns a poor 1.3 TD/INT ratio through nine starts as a rookie. Maye could see a bump in projections in a road tilt against the Bills, assuming the Patriots fall behind big early and the weather is tolerable in Buffalo. That said, his value is limited to two-QB formats in Week 16.
#### Kendre Miller (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Miller was hardly involved for most of the game but had to shoulder a bigger workload after RB1 Alvin Kamara exited with a groin injury early in the fourth quarter. The second-year backup logged eight carries and his lone target during this quarter, and he finished with a career high in rushing yards. Meanwhile, RB3 Jamaal Williams finished without a carry or a target. Kamara did not return before the end of Sunday's contest, leaving his status uncertain for next week's contest versus Green Bay on Monday, Dec. 23. Should he miss time, then Miller should be in line to step in as the feature back for New Orleans.
#### Saquon Barkley (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Barkley missed nearly the entire second quarter with an undisclosed issue, though he handled 12 carries in the final two quarters to alleviate any injury concerns. It still wasn't a spectacular showing, as he was largely held in check by the Steelers, with the only exception being a 22-yard gain late in the first quarter. Barkley was also denied a touchdown for the second consecutive game, though he should have a chance to bounce back in Week 16 against the Commanders.
#### Jaylen Warren (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Pat Freiermuth was the only Steelers' skill-position player to deliver a useful fantasy performance as the offense ran only 41 plays for the game. Warren did avoid any back-breaking mistakes, unlike Najee Harris, though this marked his fewest yards from scrimmage since Week 3. Warren's usage on the ground has been inconsistent this season, though he's had more regular production as a pass catcher and should have the chance to bounce back in that role in a Week 16 matchup against Baltimore.
