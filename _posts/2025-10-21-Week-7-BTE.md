## üè• Player Report

### üü¢ Jacoby Brissett (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Making his second straight start in place of Kyler Murray (foot), Brissett had another productive performance as he connected with Trey McBride for a 15-yard score in the second quarter and a 12-yard strike in the third. The veteran QB has thrown for 599 yards in place of Murray -- the best two-game stretch of his career -- with a 4:1 TD:INT, but with Arizona on bye in Week 8, Brissett may be returning to the bench for a Week 9 tilt against the Cowboys' porous defense.
</div>

### üü¢ Roschon Johnson (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Johnson has two rushing attempts while seeing offensive snaps in just two games this season. His lack of involvement leaves him with minimal fantasy value.
</div>

### üü¢ DJ Moore (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Moore went from still being in a DC-area hospital Tuesday morning following the Bears' Week 6 win over the Commanders to pacing Chicago in receiving yards and sharing the team lead in receptions Sunday. Moore didn't look any worse for wear after suffering a groin injury versus Washington, and he's now cleared 40 receiving yards in consecutive games for the second time this season. The Bears' passing attack remains a relatively low-volume one most weeks, but Moore will remain an important target for Caleb Williams in a Week 8 road matchup against the Ravens next Sunday afternoon.
</div>

### üü¢ Tee Higgins (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Higgins was outshined by fellow wideout Ja'Marr Chase, who finished with a surreal 16-161-1 line on 23 targets. However, under normal circumstances, Higgins' night would be considered a rousing success, as the veteran receiver put together season highs in all three components of his stat line. Higgins has encouragingly logged a combined 18 targets over his first two games working with Joe Flacco, and the duo will now have some extra practice time to continue building chemistry ahead of a Week 8 home matchup against the Jets on Sunday, Oct. 26.
</div>

### üü¢ Joe Flacco (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Flacco had an abbreviated practice schedule for the second time in as many weeks since joining the Bengals, but the truncated preparation time clearly didn't affect the veteran signal-caller. As his final line implies, Flacco was crisp throughout the night and displayed elite chemistry with Ja'Marr Chase, who he smartly trained the bulk of his attention on. The duo combined for 16 completions, 161 yards and a touchdown, and Flacco also connected with Tee Higgins (29 yards) and Noah Fant (five yards) for his other pair of scores. Flacco now has a 5:0 TD:INT through his first pair of games in a Cincinnati uniform, and he'll finally have some extra time to settle in with the playbook ahead of a Week 8 home clash against the Jets on Sunday, Oct. 26.
</div>

### üü¢ Jerome Ford (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Ford was given his fewest snaps (13) and second-fewest touches of the season, seeing less touch volume than Dylan Sampson (nine snaps, four touches), who also returned two kickoffs while Ford did not. That usage on special teams may be telling. It's a change that began in Week 6, when Sampson returned five kickoffs to Ford's one as the rookie takes over the top backup job behind starter Quinshon Judkins. With two more weeks before the trade deadline, Ford could be on the move before Nov. 4.
</div>

### üü° Christian Kirk (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### üü¢ C.J. Stroud (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Fresh off of a season-high, four-touchdown performance against the Ravens, Stroud reverted to inconsistent pocket play in a deflating loss to the Seahawks. The 23-year-old failed to complete 50 percent of his passes while finishing as many touchdown drives as the dominant defense playing behind him. Stroud didn't get much help from his ground game, actually finishing Monday's loss as the Texans' leading rusher ahead of Woody Marks (10-15-0) and Nick Chubb (5-16-0). He also lost top wideout Nico Collins early in the fourth quarter to a concussion, a situation worth monitoring ahead of next Sunday's tilt against the 49ers. Stroud's stock would suffer further in Week 8 if Collins is unable to clear the league's concussion protocol.
</div>

### üî¥ J.J. McCarthy (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### üü¢ Juwan Johnson (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The veteran tight end tied Chris Olave for the team lead in receptions while checking in as the runner-up to him in receiving yards. Johnson's yardage total was a new season high and his best since Week 18 of last season, while his target tally was just two fewer than the combined number of looks he'd seen in the previous three games. Sunday's level of involvement was particularly encouraging considering the availability of both Taysom Hill and Foster Moreau, and Johnson should continue to be a focal point of the offense in a Week 8 home matchup against a Buccaneers defense that's notoriously generous to tight ends.
</div>

### üü¢ Breece Hall (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Jets had an abysmal offensive showing, mustering only 220 net yards on 60 plays. Hall was a part of that, though he had very little running room as the offense offered minimal threat through the passing game. His longest gain from scrimmage was only eight yards, and Hall has now been held below 60 total yards in four of seven games this season. Given that he's also yet to find the end zone, his fantasy output has been very volatile.
</div>

### üü¢ Dallas Goedert (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Goedert was a distant third in receiving yards and saw only half the targets of the runner-up in that category, A.J. Brown. The veteran tight end has taken a more prominent role in the offense on certain weeks so far this season -- especially Week 6 against the Giants (9-110-1) -- but Goedert still is a clear third cog behind DeVonta Smith and Brown and has 37 receiving yards or fewer in four of the last five games. Goedert gets another crack at the G-Men in a Week 8 home matchup next Sunday afternoon.
</div>

### üü¢ Kendrick Bourne (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Bourne failed to extend his unlikely streak of recording exactly 142 yards to three games in Sunday's win. The drop-off was drastic for the veteran wideout after finishing with a season-low two targets. The victory was led by San Francisco's defense and rushing attack, resulting in poor receiving lines for every position player outside of RB Christian McCaffrey (7-72-0). Bourne's role could reduce further in Week 8 if Ricky Pearsall (knee) is able to return from injury. For now, consider Bourne a deep-league option against the Texans next Sunday.
</div>

### üü¢ Zach Charbonnet (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Charbonnet was the money-maker out of Seattle's talented backfield duo Monday, cashing in both of his team's rushing touchdowns on the evening. Kenneth Walker (17-66-0) received five more carries and was the game's leading rusher, but it is obvious which stat line fantasy GMs prefer in Week 7. Charbonnet's nose for the end zone (five touchdowns in six active games) has helped mask a career-worst mark of 2.8 YPC. The skilled backup should continue generating flex value when the Seahawks come out of a Week 8 bye to face the Commanders on Nov. 2.
</div>

### üü¢ Kenneth Walker III (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Walked finished as the Seahawks' leading rusher with a team-high 17 carries on Monday Night Football. The veteran starter's fantasy managers will still feel jealous of teammate Zach Charbonnet's 12-49-2 rushing line after the latter cashed in a pair of goal-line carries. Walker is still providing more volume out of Seattle's backfield through seven weeks, generating 430 rushing yards off of a career-best 4.7 YPC with three trips to the end zone himself. Both talented rushers will be worth starting in fantasy when the Seahawks return from the upcoming bye week to face the Commanders on Nov. 2.
</div>

### üü° Terry McLaurin (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### üü¢ Chris Moore (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Moore continued filling in for injured starters after popping up with a 3-46-1 receiving line against the Bears in Week 6. Jaylin Lane (3-60-0) finished as Washington's leading receiver in an otherwise forgettable overall performance against a division rival. Moore could be find himself in another elevated role against the Chiefs if Terry McLaurin (quadriceps) and Deebo Samuel (knee) remain sidelined next Monday.
