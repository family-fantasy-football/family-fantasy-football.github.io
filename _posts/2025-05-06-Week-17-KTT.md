## Player Report

#### Drake London (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** The eighth overall pick from the 2022 Draft is now under contract through 2026, although it may not be long before he signs an extension that locks him in beyond that. London had career highs in every major counting stat last year, including 41 more targets (158) and 366 more yards (1,271) than his previous personal bests. He had just three 100-yard performances, but two of those came in the final two games after Michael Penix took over as Atlanta's starting QB. There should be plenty of volume for London again in 2025, after the Falcons focused on their defense this offseason and failed to acquire any significant competition for targets or carries.
#### DeAndre Hopkins (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Hopkins split the 2024 campaign between the Titans and Kansas City, posting a 56-610-5 line on 80 targets in 16 regular-season games. Overall, it marked his fewest catches and receiving yards since 2021, when he was limited to 10 appearances with the Cardinals. Hopkins will turn 33 in June, and with Zay Flowers (knee) and Rashod Bateman (undisclosed) currently serving as Baltimore's top receivers and TEs Mark Andrews and Isaiah Likely also on the roster, Hopkins may not be better than the fifth option in the passing game for Lamar Jackson.
#### Kareem Hunt (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Hunt joined Kansas City last September in the wake of an early-season IR stint for Isiah Pacheco due to a fractured fibula. He served as the team's starter for a stretch and then split backfield reps with Pacheco once the latter returned to the lineup, up through the Chiefs' loss to Philadelphia in Super Bowl LIX. Hunt concluded the regular season with 200 carries for 728 yards and seven scores across 13 appearances, plus 23 catches for 176 yards through the air (32 targets). A full offseason to get back to 100 percent form may allow Pacheco to reclaim a firm grasp on the lead role of the Chiefs' backfield, which also added speedster Elijah Mitchell in free agency, but Hunt's solid showing in 2024 figures to leave him in position for a solid amount of complementary snaps. The exact pecking order of Kansas City's rushing attack may not gain clarity until training camp and/or the preseason.
#### Zamir White (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Jeanty's expected to take on a workhorse role out of the gate, and free-agent signing Raheem Mostert is better suited to playing in pass-catching situations than White, who has just 21 catches through three NFL seasons. White has presumably recovered from the quadriceps injury that sidelined him after Week 11 in 2024, but he's unlikely to meaningfully challenge Jeanty for early-down work considering White averaged just 2.8 yards per carry in 2024. Sincere McCormick (ankle), Dylan Laube and Chris Collier also will compete for roles in Vegas' backfield.
#### George Pickens (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Pickens is entering the final year of his rookie deal with Pittsburgh, and the team spent a second-round pick to acquire fellow big-play-specialist DK Metcalf earlier this offseason. The Steelers then signed Metcalf to a five-year, $150 million contract, a move that has resulted in questions about Pickens' long-term future with the team. While Pittsburgh reportedly isn't directly shopping the 24-year-old, he figures to have a strong market for teams in need of a No. 1 or talented No. 2 option at wideout, especially if there remains belief around the league that his production upside remains untapped. Quarterback play has doubtless limited Pickens across his first three seasons in the league, and the Steelers' starter under center for 2025 still remains undetermined.
#### Sterling Shepard (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Known for a promising career that was derailed by a series of severe injuries, Shepard left the Giants for the first time last year and ended up spending much of 2024 as Tampa Bay's No. 3 or 4 receiver. He'll likely enter camp somewhere between fourth and sixth on the depth chart, unless Chris Godwin's recovery from an ankle dislocation comes along slower than expected. Godwin, Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan are locked in as the team's top three wide receivers, leaving the likes of Shepard, Trey Palmer and Rakim Jarrett to compete for depth roles.
#### Will Levis (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The pick was expected for some time beforehand, and the Titans likely would've already moved Levis if they got an offer for something like a mid-round pick. The question now is whether they'll trade him for less than that, creating a fresh start for both parties after back-to-back disastrous seasons for the Tennessee offense since Levis was taken 33rd overall in the 2023 NFL Draft. Levis turns 26 in June and hasn't shown much on the field that hints at developing into a legitimate NFL starter, but he does have a strong arm, decent mobility and a prototypical build (6-foot-4, 229 pounds).
