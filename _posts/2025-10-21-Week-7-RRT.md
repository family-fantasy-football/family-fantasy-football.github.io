## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Trey McBride (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The fourth-year tight end hasn't missed a beat with Jacoby Brissett under center instead of Kyler Murray (foot). McBride hauled in scores of 15 yards in the second quarter and 12 yards in the third, and through two games working with Brissett, he's delivered an 18-146-3 line on 24 targets as Arizona's clear No. 1 downfield option. With the Cardinals on bye Week 8, Murray could get enough time to recover, but no matter who he's catching passes from, McBride could be poised for another impressive performance Week 9 against the Cowboys.
</div>

### 🟢 DeAndre Hopkins (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Baltimore's passing game was limited under the direction of Cooper Rush and Tyler Huntley on Sunday, but an underlying detail from the game was Hopkins' playing time ticking up. Hopkins played a season-high 26 snaps, which was good for 33 percent of the plays. He also had a season-high four targets. Baltimore is on a bye in Week 7, but given that Hopkins has been excellent on a per-target basis (13.7 YPT), it would not be surprising to see his role continue on an upward trend, especially when Lamar Jackson returns.
</div>

### 🟢 Chuba Hubbard (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Hubbard returned from a two-game absence and drew every touch on Carolina's first offensive possession. He went on to alternate drives with Rico Dowdle for the entire game, which naturally led to a near-even split in touches. Hubbard was far less efficient, as Dowdle outgained him, 96-55. It remains to be seen if that affects Hubbard's usage moving forward, but he managed to maintain a significant role in Carolina's offense despite Dowdle's strong showing during his absence.
</div>

### 🟢 Ja'Marr Chase (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Chase's eye-popping reception and target totals were career-high figures, as the All-Pro receiver put together a night for the ages in only his second game working with Joe Flacco. The 2021 first-round pick also struck for his fifth touchdown catch of the season on an eight-yard grab with under five minutes remaining in the first half. Chase's otherworldly numbers aren't completely surprising considering the multiple memorable performances he's already put together in his career, but Thursday's effort was clearly on another level. Given his undeniable chemistry with Flacco, Chase will remain an elite option in all formats during a Week 8 home matchup against the Jets on Sunday, Oct. 26.
</div>

### 🟢 David Montgomery (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jahmyr Gibbs went off for 218 yards and two touchdowns on Monday Night Football, leaving scraps for Montgomery's fantasy managers in Week 7. The latter still received 15 touches, highlighting his continued involvement in Detroit's two-pronged backfield. Both talented rushers have recorded a 100-plus yard rushing game this season, with Gibbs having the edge in total yards (+269) and touchdowns (+3). Montgomery may not be as tantalizing an asset as Gibbs, but he should continue providing flex value in fantasy when the Lions resume play in Week 9.
</div>

### 🟢 Dalton Schultz (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Schultz saved his best for the bright lights of Monday Night Football, coming out of the loss with new season highs in targets, receptions and yardage. The veteran tight end also finished as the Texans' leading receiver after Nico Collins (concussion) was forced out of the contest early in the fourth quarter. Schultz had been a high-floor option in deeper formats prior to Monday's outburst, but his target share could be elevated in Week 8 if Collins is unable to suit up against the 49ers on Sunday.
</div>

### 🟡 Josh Downs (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 Travis Etienne Jr. (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> While the fourth-year back was effective with his touches, Etienne got phased out of the game plan in the second half after the Jaguars fell behind 21-0 before halftime. Heading into the team's Week 8 bye, Etienne sports an impressive 594 scrimmage yards and three total TDs through seven contests.
</div>

### 🟡 Hassan Haskins (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Haskins suited up for Sunday's 38-24 loss to the Colts despite initially being listed as questionable for the game due to a chest injury, and he's now emerged from the contest managing a hamstring issue. Kimani Vidal logged 13 touches on offense versus three for Haskins against Indianapolis, but neither back got much done in an unusual matchup that saw Justin Herbert log a season-high 55 pass attempts. If Haskins is unable to get healthy on a short week in time to suit up for Thursday Night Football against the Vikings, expect Nyheim Hines to be elevated from the practice squad as the No. 2 option behind Vidal.
</div>

### 🟢 Matthew Stafford (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Puka Nacua's (ankle) absence likely created concerns for Stafford's managers heading into Sunday's overseas tilt against an up-and-coming Jacksonville defense. The veteran signal-caller proved that no Puka was no problem, hooking up with his other superstar, wideout Davante Adams, in the end zone thrice en route to a record-setting day. Stafford's five touchdown passes set a new single-game record for the NFL's International Series, which officially started back in 2007. The 37-year-old will enter the Rams' bye week completing 67 percent of his passes for 1,866 yards and 17 touchdowns to just two interceptions in seven starts for Los Angeles.
</div>

### 🟢 Rhamondre Stevenson (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Stevenson's carry and rushing yard totals were both season highs, and for the second straight game the running back (who had recorded three lost fumbles over the first five weeks of the season) didn't put the ball on the carpet. As long as he continues to demonstrate improved ball security, Stevenson should provide fantasy utility while leading a New England backfield that also includes rookie TreVeyon Henderson and Terrell Jennings, who both were on the field for just nine snaps versus Tennessee while Stevenson logged 49 of 65 snaps on offense Sunday, per Mike Reiss of ESPN.com. Next up for the 5-2 Patriots is a Week 8 home game against the 2-5 Browns, who have limited opponents to an average of 82.4 rushing yards per game to date.
</div>

### 🟢 Spencer Rattler (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> When asked if the team needs to get a look at rookie Tyler Shough at some point this season, Moore said that will be a "week-to-week thing," according to Underhill. Rattler tossed three interceptions and lost one fumble against Chicago, but prior to Week 7 he'd only thrown one pick and lost zero fumbles. If Rattler can get back to taking care of the football, he should have a longer leash under center. However, he still offers minimal fantasy appeal.
</div>

### 🟢 A.J. Brown (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Brown saw DeVonta Smith put together a spectacular 9-183-1 line on 11 targets to pace Philadelphia's air attack, but the former contributed on a markedly more efficient basis by recording grabs of 37, 26, 13 and 45 yards. The first two of those receptions went for touchdowns in the first and fourth quarter, respectively, while the final one came on third down with less than two minutes remaining and allowed the Eagles to run out the clock. Brown has between six and 10 targets over his last six games, and he's come alive in the last pair of contests with a 10-201-2 line in that span. Brown and the Eagles will be looking for a bit of revenge Week 8, as a Giants team they just lost to in Week 6 pays a visit to Philadelphia next Sunday afternoon.
</div>

### 🟢 Cooper Kupp (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Seahawks tried to get cute in the second quarter with a wide receiver pass play that resulted in an interception for Kupp. Depending on league settings, the veteran wideout's rare turnover may have erased more than half of his fantasy production Monday. The one target is the concerning takeaway after Kupp scored his first touchdown as a member of the Seahawks in Week 6. The 32-year-old will carry a 24-293-1 receiving line into Seattle's upcoming bye week before resuming play against the Commanders on Nov. 2.
</div>

### 🟢 Sam Darnold (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Darnold escaped Monday's primetime tilt with a win, but he couldn't escape the teeth of Houston's elite defense. In addition to his fourth interception of the season, the veteran signal-caller was strip sacked in his own end zone after making an ill-advised decision to roll out to DE Will Anderson's side. Darnold's 54.8 completion percentage also checks in as his lowest mark through seven starts with Seattle. The overall results have been positive from the 28-year-old this year, so fantasy managers can chalk this one up to a tough matchup. They will, however, need to find a replacement for Darnold in Week 8 until the Seahawks return from the upcoming bye week on Sunday, Nov. 2.
</div>

### 🟢 Jaxon Smith-Njigba (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Smith-Njigba turned in another stellar fantasy performance while pacing the Seahawks in every receiving category on Monday Night Football. It was the budding superstar's third consecutive game recording at least 100 receiving yards while also scoring a touchdown. Smith-Njigba bumped his season totals up to 50-819-4 heading into Seattle's upcoming Week 8 bye, which has the Ohio State product on pace to finish 11 yards shy of a 2,000-yard campaign. He'll continue his ascension towards the peak of fantasy stardom when the Seahawks take on the Commanders on Sunday, Nov. 2.
