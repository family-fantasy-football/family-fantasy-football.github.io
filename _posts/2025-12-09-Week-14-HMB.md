## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Zay Flowers (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Lamar Jackson looked Flowers' way often, and Flowers matched his highest target total of the season while hitting double-digit opportunities for the third time this season. He took advantage with long gains of 35, 33 and 31 yards to top 100 yards for only the second time on the campaign. The only shortcoming in the performance was Flowers' inability to find the end zone, as he has not scored since Week 1.
</div>

### 🟢 Derrick Henry (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Despite playing from a deficit for most of the game, the Ravens made a point of getting Henry involved in the offense, as his 25 carries were his highest mark of the season. He's had considerable success against the Steelers in the past, totaling 348 yards on the ground in his last two matchups, though the Pittsburgh defense got the better end of things Sunday by limiting him to only 3.8 yards per carry. Henry still managed a few chunk gains of 19 and nine yards, topping 100 yards from scrimmage for the third time in his last four games in the process.
</div>

### 🟢 Josh Allen (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Bills found themselves staring at a 21-11 deficit at halftime, but Allen once again put the team on his back in a comeback victory, with a 40-yard touchdown run in the snow midway through the fourth quarter being his biggest play -- the longest TD run in history by a Buffalo quarterback, breaking his own record. Allen has reached 12 rushing touchdowns for the third straight season while also producing a 22:10 TD:INT in 13 games, and he'll likely need to be sharp again in a huge AFC East showdown against the Patriots in Week 15.
</div>

### 🟢 Jerry Jeudy (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The veteran wideout put together one of his few productive performances of the season to date, posting his second-highest receiving yardage total with the help of a season-long 60 yard reception that went for a touchdown with under three minutes remaining late in the first half. Jeudy appears to be developing some encouraging chemistry with Shedeur Sanders, now having posted a 7-141-1 line on 12 targets over the latter's first three starts.
</div>

### 🟢 Amon-Ra St. Brown (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The standout receiver's availability was in question leading up to game day due to the low-ankle sprain he'd suffered on Thanksgiving against the Packers, but St. Brown looked to be free of any limitations while making several noteworthy catches. St. Brown finished second in receptions and receiving  yards on the night, while also tying Jameson Williams for the team lead in targets. The fifth-year pro also helped seal Detroit's win via his game-long 37-yard grab with under three minutes remaining, setting up Jahmyr Gibbs' 13-yard touchdown run on the next play. St. Brown has now exceeded 90 receiving yards on five occasions heading into a Week 15 road showdown against the Rams on Sunday, Dec. 14.
</div>

### 🟢 Jordan Love (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Love followed up his four-score outing from Thanksgiving with Sunday's three-touchdown effort in another win over a division foe. The 26-year-old also threw his fourth interception of the season, but it barely dented his 120.7 passer rating against the Bears. Love has completed 67 percent of his passes for 3,028 passing yards while generating 22 touchdowns and six turnovers across 13 starts in 2025. With his midseason cold spell in the rear-view mirror, Love is looking like a startable fantasy asset again as the fantasy playoffs approach.
</div>

### 🟡 Alec Pierce (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> NFL players are not allowed to talk to reporters after the game if in the concussion protocol, so a concussion can be ruled out at this point. It sounds like a minor injury, but check his status in practice early in the week. Pierce recorded five receptions on eight targets for 80 yards in the loss.
</div>

### 🟢 Kareem Hunt (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Hunt struggled generating running room on his 12 carries Sunday, but he rewarded fantasy managers with the only touchdown from Kansas City's side in the primetime loss. Former starter Isiah Pacheco remained involved by gaining the same yardage on nine carries, but he couldn't match the starter's trip to the end zone. Hunt has been providing a high floor since taking over lead-back duties, a scenario that should hold true in Week 15 against the Chargers.
</div>

### 🟢 Tre Tucker (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Tucker tied for second on the team in targets, though he managed only two catches for modest gains of 13 and 11 yards. All of his targets and production came with Geno Smith (hand) under center, so his outlook is murky heading into a Week 15 matchup against the Eagles with Kenny Pickett potentially leading the offense. Even if Smith is able to suit up, Tucker has now been held to under 30 receiving yards in three straight games.
</div>

### 🟢 Keenan Allen (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Allen was his usual reliable self on third down, specifically in the first half, but the veteran was hardly needed as the Raiders offense continually stalled out. Justin Herbert fractured his left hand during the first half, an injury that will require surgery Monday. Head coach Jim Harbaugh and Herbert are hopeful the quarterback will be available in a critical Week 14 bout against the Eagles, but Allen's fantasy value arguably takes the biggest hit if the starting quarterback misses time. The 33-year-old has failed to see more than six targets in a game dating back to Week 8.
</div>

### 🟢 Colby Parkinson (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Parkinson finished third among Rams pass catchers in targets and trailed only Puka Nacua, who dominated with a 7-167-2 line, in receiving yardage. Since Tyler Higbee (ankle) landed on IR ahead of Week 12, Parkinson has emerged as the Rams' top tight end with 11 catches for 100 yards and two touchdowns over three games. Pushing that out further, Parkinson has tallied four scores over his past five contests, making him an intriguing -- though TD-dependent -- fantasy option at a relatively shallow position.
</div>

### 🟢 Jordan Mason (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Aaron Jones saw a little more volume and gained a little more real estate with 14 carries for 76 yards, but Mason was the one who got into the end zone on an eight-yard dash in the second quarter. Mason also topped 50 rushing yards for the first time since Week 7 as he saw double-digit carries for the first time since Week 9. If the Minnesota backfield remains close to a 50-50 split again in Week 15, Mason stands a good chance of posting strong numbers against a vulnerable Cowboys defense.
</div>

### 🟢 Kenneth Gainwell (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Steelers continued their recent pattern of work in the backfield, with Jaylen Warren serving as the traditional lead back and Gainwell mixing in primarily on passing downs. Despite that, Gainwell made his biggest impact on a six-yard touchdown run midway through the second quarter -- his first rushing score since  Week 4. While he was ineffective as a receiver, Gainwell now has at least six catches in three of his last four games.
</div>

### 🟡 Darnell Washington (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Washington, who caught his only target in the contest for 12 yards, will thus target a potential return to action Dec. 15 against the Dolphins. Jonnu Smith, Pat Freiermuth and Connor Heyward are left to handle Pittsburgh's TE duties for the remainder of Week 14 action.
</div>

### 🟢 Cam Ward (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Titans clawed their way to their second win of the season Sunday, and Ward did contribute with 14- and five-yard scoring tosses to Elic Ayomanor and Chimere Dike. While that marked the first multi-touchdown effort of Ward's career, the rookie first overall pick also posted his third-lowest completion percentage of the season and recorded just one completion of 20-plus yards. Ward now has four sub-200-yard tallies in his last five games, an unfavorable pattern he'll look to snap in a Week 15 road matchup against the 49ers next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Jacory Croskey-Merritt (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Croskey-Merritt was once again uninspiring in Week 14, playing 10 snaps on offense, which was 12 fewer than fellow running back Chris Rodriguez (22). Croskey-Merritt has now gone eight straight games without reaching the end zone, and he hasn't crossed 40 yards on the ground since Week 6. With Washington's season going sideways and Rodriguez getting the majority of the workload in the backfield, Croskey-Merritt is an unappealing fantasy option at the moment.
