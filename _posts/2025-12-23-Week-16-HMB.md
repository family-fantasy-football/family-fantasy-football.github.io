## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Derrick Henry (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Henry had built steam by the fourth quarter of Sunday's loss, in which he logged 18 carries for 128 yards and two touchdowns while also losing one fumble. Nonetheless, it was Keaton Mitchell who started the entirety of Baltimore's final drive, within which he rushed twice for four yards. On the night, Mitchell had nine carries for 13 yards. Harbaugh's statement at least confirms that Henry didn't miss the final drive due to any sort of injury, but fantasy managers would certainly prefer Henry's utilization to have spanned the final stretches of a must-win contest in which he averaged 7.1 YPC. Harbaugh noted that in retrospect he "would rather have had [Henry] starting the [final] drive." The veteran RB will look to remain impactful as the Ravens fight to stick around in the AFC playoff picture on the road against Green Bay on Saturday.
</div>

### 🟢 Zay Flowers (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Flowers had one of his better showings of the season, as he topped 100 yards from scrimmage for only the third time in 15 games. He was particularly involved as a pass catcher early in the contest -- before Lamar Jackson exited with a back injury -- logging receptions of 19 and 18 yards on Baltimore's first possession before chipping in a 14-yard catch on the team's second drive. Flowers also found the end zone for the second consecutive game on a 14-yard end-around late in the third quarter. Despite turning in one of his more productive games of the season, Flowers' effort was overshadowed by a lost fumble late in the game that helped New England clinch the win.
</div>

### 🟡 Josh Allen (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Allen is tending to a sore right foot in the aftermath of the Bills' 23-20 win over the Browns on Sunday, when the quarterback took a back seat as a passer (12 completions on 19 attempts for a season-low 130 yards and no touchdowns) but continued to be involved as a ball carrier (seven totes for 17 yards). McDermott noted that Allen is still hurting two days after the game, but the Bills fully anticipate that the 29-year-old will suit up this Sunday against the Eagles.
</div>

### 🟢 Jalen Coker (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Coker has drawn between four and six targets in six straight games as the distant second or third option in the Carolina offense behind rookie Tetairoa McMillan. Coker has yet to hit 75 yards in any single game this season and has settled in as a low-ceiling fantasy option ahead of next Sunday's game against the Seahawks.
</div>

### 🟢 Jerry Jeudy (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jeudy's four targets tied for third on the team against Buffalo, but it marked the veteran receiver's 11th game held below 50 receiving yards this season. Jeudy has just two touchdowns on the year and has shown no ceiling with an extremely low fantasy floor. Even in a plus on-paper matchup against the Steelers next Sunday, Jeudy will be difficult to trust.
</div>

### 🟢 Shedeur Sanders (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> To his credit, Sanders kept the Browns in contention against Josh Allen and company for most of the afternoon despite short-circuiting a pair of drives with interceptions. However, Sanders could arguably be mostly exonerated in both instances, as the first came on a deflection off the hands of Quinshon Judkins (leg/ankle) and the second was tipped at the line of scrimmage. Sanders connected with his favorite target, fellow rookie Harold Fannin, for his one TD toss from 13 yards out to open the scoring in the first quarter, but he has just a 1:5 TD:INT in his last pair of contests. The rookie fifth-round pick will next tangle with the Steelers' veteran defense in a Week 17 home matchup next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟡 Amon-Ra St. Brown (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Detroit held a walkthrough Monday, so St. Brown's lack of participation is only an estimation. The star wideout is coming off a 29-24 loss to the Steelers in which he secured four of nine targets for 54 yards and nearly added a touchdown, but he had the would-be score nullified by penalty. He now faces a short week of rest before Thursday's road matchup against the Vikings. St. Brown may have to resume practicing in at least a limited capacity Tuesday and/or Wednesday in order to be cleared for action on Christmas Day.
</div>

### 🟡 Jordan Love (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Though Love was diagnosed with a concussion just three days earlier after being forced out of Saturday's 22-16 overtime loss to the Bears, he already appears to be making some progress through the league's five-step protocol for head injuries. That being said, LaFleur noted that he doesn't necessarily feel any better of Love's chances of being able to play this Saturday against the Ravens than he did 48 hours ago, with the coach noting that the Packers need to see how the quarterback progresses over the next few days before his Week 17 status is determined, per Zach Jacobson of 247Sports.com. LaFleur offered similar sentiments about backup Malik Willis' odds of playing Saturday, as Willis will also be limited Tuesday after sustaining an injury to his throwing shoulder while coming on in relief of Love in Week 16. At this stage of the week, practice-squad member Clayton Tune is the only quarterback in the organization who's fully healthy.
</div>

### 🟢 Kareem Hunt (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> In their first game without Patrick Mahomes (knee), the Chiefs embarrassingly ran just 43 offensive plays against the now 3-12 Titans. Along the way, Gardner Minshew also suffered a knee injury, leading to QB3 Chris Oladokun playing a majority of the game for Kansas City. At this point, the Chiefs are just playing out the string in a lost season, giving Hunt minimal fantasy appeal for Christmas Day against the Broncos.
</div>

### 🟢 Keenan Allen (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Allen has yet to exceed 60 yards receiving since Week 7, but he's been a reliable safety net tallying at least four receptions in four of the past five games. The veteran figures to be a critical part of the offense next week given how potent Houston's pass rush can be, especially against a Los Angeles offensive line besieged by injuries.
</div>

### 🟢 Colby Parkinson (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Despite Matthew Stafford putting up monster numbers (457 yards passing and three touchdowns), Parkinson failed to make much of an impact against the team that drafted him in 2020. Terrance Ferguson earned the lone touchdown for the Rams' tight end corps in the contest, while Parkinson failed to see a target in the red zone. While the veteran tight end has touchdowns in five of his last seven games and led the trio in snap count, this game served as a reminder of Parkinson's floor. If Tyler Higbee (ankle) returns next week for the Week 17 showdown with the Falcons, this already crowded tight end room would be even more difficult to navigate for fantasy purposes.
</div>

### 🟢 Darren Waller (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Waller couldn't fully exploit what has been the most favorable matchup in the league for tight ends this season, although he did contribute a 22-yard grab on one of his three catches. The veteran tight end was working with rookie quarterback Quinn Ewers for the first time, and given they flashed some solid chemistry, Waller could be set for even more work against another defense that tends to give up production to his position, that of the Buccaneers, in a Week 17 home matchup.
</div>

### 🟡 Jordan Mason (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Both Mason and Aaron Jones left the Vikings' first possession of Sunday's win at the Giants due to ankle injuries, and while Jones was able to return and finish out the contest, Mason was ruled out not long after his initial exit. Minnesota didn't hold practice Monday ahead of Thursday's game against the Lions, but Mason appears in danger of logging his first absence of the season.
</div>

### 🟢 Jalen Nailor (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> He figures to fill his usual role as the Vikings' No. 3 receiver, coming off a two-TD showing at Dallas in Week 16. Nailor returned to full practice participation Friday after limited sessions earlier in the week.
</div>

### 🟢 Kenneth Gainwell (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Gainwell maintained his key role as a pass catcher in the Pittsburgh offense, finishing second on the team with seven targets. The Lions did a good job containing him for most of the game, though Gainwell managed an improbable 45-yard touchdown grab just before the end of the first half when he made the initial catch from the ground before popping up without being touched to reach the end zone. While overshadowed by Jaylen Warren on the ground, Gainwell also chipped in a long rush of 18 yards to help him reach 100 yards from scrimmage for the third time in his last five games. He's also reached the end zone twice in that span.
</div>

### 🟢 Jacory Croskey-Merritt (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Croskey-Merritt saw all eight of his carries in the first half to lead the team, though he curiously disappeared in the final two quarters in favor of Chris Rodriguez. Croskey-Merritt wasn't particularly efficient with his opportunity overall, but he did record long gains of 13 and seven yards while also punching in a touchdown from one yard away. It's unclear why Croskey-Merritt was phased out of the offense, but he appears to still have a role, even after Rodriguez returned from a one-game absence.
