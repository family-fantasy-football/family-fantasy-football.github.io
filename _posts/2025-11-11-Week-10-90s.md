## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Lamar Jackson (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jackson helped move the Ravens' offense effectively for most of the game, but he and the rest of the unit repeatedly stalled near the goal line. He managed to break through with a two-yard touchdown pass early in the fourth quarter to Mark Andrews to account for his only score of the game. This performance marked Jackson's second game this season with only one touchdown, though he has found the end zone at least three times in his remaining four contests.
</div>

### 🟢 Quinshon Judkins (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Judkins was battling a shoulder injury prior to Cleveland's Week 9 bye, but he handled a healthy workload against the Jets, coming one touch shy of his career-high 25. The rookie second-round pick is the clear No. 1 option in the backfield for the Browns heading into a Week 11 home game against the Ravens. Baltimore beat the Browns by 24 points back in Week 2, and Judkins' rushing workload could be limited again if the rematch plays out similarly.
</div>

### 🟢 Jameson Williams (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Williams has had frustratingly low production for most of the season, though he managed to top 100 receiving yards for the second time while also finding the end zone for the second consecutive contest. His longest gain of the day came midway through the third quarter when he broke free over the middle of the field and sprinted down the sideline for 41 yards. Williams also tallied a 22-yard reception in addition to his 14-yard touchdown. Per Adam Schefter of ESPN, Dan Campbell took over play-calling duties for the game, which could bode well for Williams if Campbell retains the duties moving forward.
</div>

### 🟢 Nico Collins (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The fifth-year wideout remained the Texans' top downfield option even with Davis Mills under center instead of C.J. Stroud (concussion), and Collins set a new season high in targets and receiving yards in Sunday's comeback win. It's only the second time this season in eight games that he's topped the century mark  -- both against the Jags -- and Collins will take a 40-550-3 line on 72 targets into a Week 11 clash with the Titans.
</div>

### 🟢 Jonathan Taylor (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The highlights of yet another memorable day for Taylor were his final two touchdowns, which consisted of an 83-yard run with just over six minutes remaining in regulation and the game-winning eight-yard scamper up the middle in overtime. Taylor's yardage total fell just short of the career-high 253 he gained against the Jaguars as a rookie back in January 2021, and it served as his third tally of more than 150 yards already this season. Taylor also now has four three-touchdown performances in his MVP-caliber 2025 campaign, and he'll have a Week 11 bye to take a breath before returning to action in a Week 12 road showdown against the Chiefs on Sunday, Nov. 23.
</div>

### 🟢 Brock Bowers (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> After putting together a career-best yardage total and recording three touchdowns just four days earlier against the Jaguars in a narrow overtime loss, Bowers saw a major downturn in production against a much stingier Broncos defense. The talented tight end did make a nice splash on his one reception and logged a rush attempt for the second straight contest, but he fell victim to another modest night for Las Vegas' air attack. Bowers' upside is above question, but Geno Smith's (quadriceps) ongoing struggles always have the potential to cap the 2024 first-round pick's production. Bowers and the Raiders do have a more palatable matchup next time out, as they'll host the Cowboys for a Monday night Week 11 matchup on Nov. 17.
</div>

### 🟡 Oronde Gadsden II (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Gadsden was forced out of Los Angeles' win over the Steelers on Sunday night early due to what was initially called a left knee injury, so the results of his MRI are ultimately encouraging. The rookie tight end's status will need to be monitored as the Chargers prepare for a road contest against the Jaguars in Week 11, but it at least appears he's avoided any sort of severe injury that could require a lengthy stint on the sidelines. Tyler Conklin and Will Dissly will operate as Los Angeles' top pass-catching tight ends if Gadsden misses any time.
</div>

### 🟢 Kimani Vidal (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Vidal bounced back in a big way from a forgettable showing against the Titans last week (12-30-0). The 23-year-old set a new personal high with Sunday's 25 carries while cashing in his second rushing touchdown (third overall) through five starts for the injured Omarion Hampton (ankle). The latter is expected to remain out until after the Chargers' Week 12 bye, affording Vidal at least one more opportunity to operate as the team's lead back. Fantasy managers should be wary against Jacksonville next Sunday, as Vidal has alternated stud and dud performances in each of the aforementioned five starts this season.
</div>

### 🟢 Tua Tagovailoa (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Tagovailoa's pair of interceptions didn't lead to any Bills points, and he helped offset the miscues with nine- and 38-yard touchdown tosses to Malik Washington and Jaylen Waddle in the first half. Tagovailoa didn't need to do much otherwise, as the Dolphins' defense put together a standout performance that indirectly resulted in the quarterback's fifth sub-200-yard tally of the season. The 2020 first-round pick does now have four multi-interception tallies this season, a troublesome trend Tagovailoa will aim to avoid in a Week 11 overseas matchup against the Commanders in Madrid.
</div>

### 🟢 Jaylen Waddle (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Waddle led the Dolphins in receiving yards and targets in the upset victory, making a significant contribution in the form of a 38-yard touchdown grab on the first play of the second quarter. The veteran wideout unsurprisingly continues to enjoy a robust role following the season-ending knee injury to Tyreek Hill, recording at least five catches and 82 receiving yards in five of his last six games. Waddle will continue in an elevated role against a porous Commanders secondary in Madrid next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Jordan Addison (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Addison earned double-digit targets for the second time this season, though he struggled to get on the same page with J.J. McCarthy. Addison has now been held under 50 receiving yards in four of six games this season, including both with McCarthy. He's likely to be a boom-or-bust receiver moving forward, with Week 11 presenting an exploitable matchup against the Bears.
</div>

### 🟢 Jordan Mason (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Mason has maintained at least an even split with Aaron Jones when both are healthy this campaign, but he matched his season-low in touches Sunday. Jones out-touched Mason 12-5, including both a goal-line opportunity and the majority of targets to the position. Given that Jones was questionable with a shoulder injury heading into the game, the workload split doesn't seem to bode well for Mason going forward.
</div>

### 🔴 Garrett Wilson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Doubtful<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Wilson underwent an MRI on Monday, and it's at least encouraging that his knee injury won't require surgery or a long-term stint on the sideline. That said, Wilson had missed the Jets' prior two games before briefly returning to action Week 10, and he now looks set to sit out until Week 14 against the Dolphins on Sunday, Dec. 7 at the earliest. Assuming Wilson is indeed officially ruled out for Thursday's game against the Patriots, whomever of Justin Fields or Tyrod Taylor is named the starting quarterback will have to rely on Adonai Mitchell, Arian Smith, Tyler Johnson, Isaiah Williams, John Metchie, Allen Lazard and TE Mason Taylor as the top pass catchers.
</div>

### 🟢 Jaylen Warren (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Warren accounted for 14 of the 16 carries by Pittsburgh's running backs, as Kenneth Gainwell was phased almost entirely out of the offense. That allowed Warren to record his second-highest rushing yardage total of the season, and he was one of the few bright spots in the offense. Warren hasn't found the end zone consistently this season, but his role has improved as the season has progressed.
</div>

### 🟢 Tyjae Spears (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Spears was out-touched only 13-12 by Tony Pollard, with Spears being the primary pass catcher. His most notable contribution was a 26-yard catch that set up a game-tying field goal late in the second quarter. That made up for Spears' lack of efficiency on the ground, as he was held to less than 4.0 yards per carry for the first time since his season debut in Week 5. Positively, Spears has at least three catches in four straight games while also seeing an uptick in his usage as a ball carrier.
</div>

### 🟢 Marcus Mariota (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Commanders ran a relatively conservative offense, but Mariota performed well when given a chance. He completed three long passes of at least 30 yards while also delivering a pair of short touchdown passes. Mariota has also topped 20 rushing yards in every game in which he's attempted a pass this season. He'll draw a relatively favorable Week 12 matchup against the Dolphins, with Jayden Daniels (elbow) remaining sidelined.
