## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Michael Wilson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Wilson had seen nearly a season's worth of work in the last two games with Marvin Harrison sitting out due to an appendectomy, with the former producing a 25-303-0 line on 33 targets. However, the third-year pro unsurprisingly saw a noteworthy reduction in opportunities with Harrison's return, although his target tally did tie for his highest of the season outside of the aforementioned pair of contests. Wilson likely will remain in a clear complementary role moving forward for as long as Harrison remains healthy, although he could have another solid target count in a Week 14 home showdown against the Rams.
</div>

### 🟢 Kirk Cousins (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Cousins had only 86 first-half passing yards but led a touchdown drive, capped by a one-yard Tyler Allgeier run, to tie the score at 7-7 with nine seconds left before halftime. Atlanta's first drive of the third quarter was also capped by a rushing score, this time on a five-yard Bijan Robinson run. Cousins then broke a 17-17 tie by connecting with David Sills for a nine-yard touchdown pass with 8:46 remaining in the fourth quarter, but the Jets scored the game's final 10 points to drop Atlanta to 4-8. Despite the slow start, Cousins ultimately exceeded 200 passing yards for the first time this season, but Atlanta's passing game won't offer much fantasy appeal in Week 14 against the Seahawks, especially if top wide receiver Drake London (knee) misses a third consecutive game.
</div>

### 🟢 Lamar Jackson (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The combination of Jackson's final line and the game's final score underscore the fact he wasn't able to offset his multiple mistakes with enough big plays. The two-time MVP saw more than half his completions (nine) and 142 of his passing yards go to the tight-end duo of Isaiah Likely and Mark Andrews, and two of his three turnovers led to a combined six points for Cincinnati. Jackson's passing yardage was his highest since Week 3, but he was clearly outplayed by Joe Burrow in the latter's return from a nine-game absence. The Ravens next face another divisional test at home, as the Steelers pay a visit for a Week 14 clash on Sunday, Dec. 7.
</div>

### 🟢 Quinshon Judkins (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> While the Browns lost the game, Judkins did manage to out-produce Christian McCaffrey by 109 combined yards to 74, although CMac scored a TD. It's the first time since Week 5, and the third time in 11 games, that Judkins reached triple-digit yards from scrimmage, and the rookie remains on pace to top 1,000 rushing yards heading into a Week 14 clash with the Titans.
</div>

### 🟢 Jameson Williams (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Amon-Ra St. Brown (ankle) left the game in the first quarter and didn't return, pushing Williams into the WR1 role for the Lions. The fourth-year player didn't disappoint, setting new season highs in catches and receiving yards while hauling in his fourth TD in the last five games on a 22-yard toss from Jared Goff in the second quarter. Per Colton Pouncy of The Athletic, coach Dan Campbell suggested after the game that while St. Brown's ankle injury wasn't believed to be too serious he could miss a game or two, so Williams could head into a Week 14 clash with the Cowboys' shaky secondary as the clear top downfield option for Goff. On the season, Williams has delivered a 38-706-6 line on 61 targets through 12 contests.
</div>

### 🟢 Nico Collins (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Collins finished as the Texans' leader in receiving yards and targets on the afternoon, logging his sixth double-digit target tally of the season while coming just short of what would have been his third 100-yard effort. He also added the first rushing touchdown of his career on a seven-yard run early in the fourth quarter that snapped a 13-13 tie. The veteran wideout has at least 75 receiving yards in four of his last five games. with three of those performances featuring 90-plus-yard efforts. Collins should be in line for another expansive role in a Week 14 road showdown against the Chiefs next Sunday night.
</div>

### 🟢 Jonathan Taylor (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Taylor didn't have any of his typical explosive plays, but he had enough volume to top 100 yards from scrimmage. His receiving line was particularly notable, as he matched his season high with five targets while topping 30 receiving yards for the fourth time. Taylor has gotten a bit more inconsistent on the ground of late, topping 90 rushing yards in only half of his lats six games. However, he's still found the end zone nine times in that span while topping 100 yards from scrimmage four times.
</div>

### 🟢 Brock Bowers (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Bowers tied the game at a touchdown apiece with a six-yard touchdown catch shortly after the two-minute warning in the second quarter, then secured a spectacular one-handed catch for another six-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter. The 2024 first-round pick missed the entire month of October due to a knee injury but bounced back in November, catching 30 of 41 targets for 348 yards and five touchdowns across five games. Bowers should continue to work as the top option in the Raiders' passing game against the Broncos in Week 14.
</div>

### 🟢 Oronde Gadsden II (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Sunday included the rookie's fewest receptions in a game dating back to Week 5 and his second-lowest yardage total after breaking out against the Dolphins back in Week 6. Negative game scripts have largely impacted Gadsden, as the Chargers have either blown out opponents or been blown out themselves in most of their contests throughout the month of November. A matchup against the Eagles in Week 14 could be a remedy for more volume, but the status of quarterback Justin Herbert will be incredibly relevant, as the Pro Bowler will have surgery to repair a fracture in his left hand Monday, leaving his status uncertain for the critical bout.
</div>

### 🟢 Kimani Vidal (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Vidal exploded for a 59-yard scamper to kick off the scoring in the second half, by far the longest run of his young career, and that resulted in the go-ahead touchdown in a game the Raiders rarely threatened. Nominal starter Omarion Hampton (ankle) looks like he is close to making his return after a seven-game absence, which would in essence end Vidal's opportunity as the team's lead back. If this was the final hurrah, the second-year back was truly marvelous compiling 24-plus touches for the third time in five weeks. Vidal at minimum will likely still spell Hampton, although neither back should be expected to have a big game against a Philadelphia defense that has stifled most opponents on the ground this year.
</div>

### 🟢 Tua Tagovailoa (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Tagovailoa's middling numbers tell the tale of a low-volume, inefficient day for the Dolphins' air attack, one that saw the veteran signal-caller finish with his seventh sub-200-yard tally of the season and lowest figure since Week 7. Tagovailoa also extended his touchdown drought to two games, and he's gone without a scoring toss in four of his last six contests overall. Given recent performances and what could be inclement early-December weather in New York, Tagovailoa doesn't profile as a particularly appealing fantasy option in a Week 14 road clash with the Jets next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Jaylen Waddle (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Waddle finished with the second-most receiving yards on the afternoon for the Dolphins after a slow start, and he also set the pace in targets. Waddle's yardage total, his lowest since Week 7, wasn't as extraordinary when considering Tua Tagovailoa passed for only 157 yards overall on the day. Waddle should remain a key part of the air attack in a Week 14 road matchup against the Jets.
</div>

### 🟢 Jordan Addison (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Third-string QB Max Brosmer struggled to deliver the ball to his top receivers in the first start of his career, instead throwing four picks while limiting WR Justin Jefferson to a career-low four yards. Addison led the Vikings in targets (10), but his quarterback's erratic play resulted in a forgettable line outside of PPR formats. It was, however, a marked improvement over the bagel the 23-year-old posted in last week's box score versus the Packers. Minnesota's entire passing attack takes a major hit with Brosmer under center, even with how poorly J.J. McCarthy (concussion) has played up until this point, so Addison's value will improve from poor to risky if his starting quarterback can return against Washington next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Devin Neal (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Neal handled the bulk of the Saints' carries en route to career highs in rushing attempts and yards. The rookie served in the top role in the absence of RB1 Alvin Kamara, who was inactive after suffering an MCL sprain during last week's loss to Atlanta. Neal didn't end uph having to truly split work out of the backfield, as the only other two running backs on the roster, Evan Hull and Audric Estime, logged five and zero carries, respectively. Meanwhile, Taysom Hill recorded just one rushing attempt as the change-of-pace dual-threat QB. With Kamara expected to miss more time moving forward, Neal seems set for moderate usage as the Saints' No. 1 running back for the time being. The Saints face the Buccaneers on the road in Week 14.
</div>

### 🟢 Jaylen Warren (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Steelers' offense wasn't able to get anything going on the ground or through the air, though Warren did manage to record their only touchdown of the day on a one-yard plunge midway through the second quarter. He otherwise was limited to a long gain of 12 yards to turn in his second-lowest yardage total of the campaign. Positively, Warren has four touchdowns in his five games after tallying only one in his first six contests.
</div>

### 🟢 Tyjae Spears (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Spears' six catches tied rookie TE Gunnar Helm for the team lead, and Spears' 25 yards were four fewer than team-leader Chig Okonkwo. Spears was out-carried 10 to two by Tony Pollard, who produced rushing 60 yards on his attempts. In eight games since returning from injured reserve due to a high-ankle sprain, Spears has rushed 39 times for 158 yards and one touchdown, adding 28 catches for 173 scoreless yards on 30 targets. Spears has been a reliable check-down target for Cam Ward, but Pollard continues to handle the majority of the carries out of Tennessee's backfield.
