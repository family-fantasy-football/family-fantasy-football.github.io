## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Kyle Pitts Sr. (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Falcons welcomed back No. 1 wideout Drake London (knee) from a four-game absence, but Pitts maintained his elevated role in Atlanta's passing game with Kirk Cousins under center. The 24-year-old Pitts was averaging 8.8 targets in the four games London missed, and the former's nine targets finished behind only RB Bijan Robinson's 11 on Sunday. The 2021 first-round pick is starting to play like one by averaging 98.8 yards with four total touchdowns over his last four starts. A red-hot Pitts will attempt to keep things rolling against the Rams next Monday.
</div>

### 🟢 Darnell Mooney (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Mooney played 92 offensive snaps with Drake London (knee) sidelined again, but he was outpaced in the receiving game by all of Kyle Pitts (11-166-3), Bijan Robinson (8-82-0) and David Sills (6-78-0). Across 12 regular-season appearances so far, Mooney has surpassed 50 receiving yards on just two occasions. He'll remain difficult to trust for fantasy purposes Week 16 on the road against Arizona, even if London is unavailable again.
</div>

### 🟢 Mark Andrews (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Andrews made a long 18-yard catch late in the first quarter, but he largely disappeared from the game thereafter. He's now been held to two or fewer catches and 25 or fewer yards in four of his last five games. Andrews isn't likely to see a significant improvement in production in a tough Week 17 matchup against Green Bay, particularly if Lamar Jackson (back) remains sidelined.
</div>

### 🟢 Keon Coleman (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> As is fellow WR Gabe Davis. As a result, Khalil Shakir, Joshua Palmer, Tyrell Shavers, Brandin Cooks and Mecole Hardman are Buffalo's available wide receivers in Week 16.
</div>

### 🟢 Tetairoa McMillan (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> McMillan finished with team-high figures in receptions, receiving yards and targets on the afternoon, and he delivered the seventh touchdown catch of his career on a 22-yard grab just before halftime. The rookie first-round pick's catch and yardage totals were both McMillan's best over the last four games, and he'll next take on the daunting challenge of the Seahawks' secondary in a Week 17 home matchup next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟡 Javonte Williams (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Cowboys held a walkthrough Monday, so Williams' activity level is only an estimate. He also had his practice reps capped Week 16 due to his neck issue, but Williams managed to suit up versus the Chargers without any sort of injury designation. He handled nine rush attempts for 34 yards versus Los Angeles, while also securing two of three targets for nine yards. As long as he's able to remain at least limited in practice Tuesday and Wednesday, Williams will have a solid chance to avoid an injury designation again for Thursday's divisional matchup against the Commanders.
</div>

### 🟡 Josh Jacobs (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jacobs shed his questionable tag and was cleared to play through his nagging knee injury in this past Saturday's 22-16 overtime loss to the Bears, but the Packers ended up managing his playing time more carefully than usual. Though Jacobs still earned 14 touches (accounting for 48 yards), Emanuel Wilson saw equal usage (14 carries for 82 yards) and outsnapped the former 33-28. On a positive note, Jacobs emerged from the game without any setbacks, which is supported by his presence on the field to kick off Week 17 prep. Jacobs will still have his reps managed Wednesday, but his limited session marks a step forward from his participation from last week, when he didn't practice in any fashion leading up to the matchup with the Bears. Jacobs should be ready to handle a heavier workload this Saturday versus the Ravens, barring any renewed soreness with his knee leading up to the contest.
</div>

### 🟢 Nick Chubb (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Chubb returned from a one-game absence in time to help fill in for injured starter Woody Marks (ankle), though it was Jawhar Jordan -- signed from the practice squad earlier this week -- who led the Texans in backfield touches (20) and total production (70 yards) Sunday. Chubb has been a shell of his former self while attempting to fill the void left by Joe Mixon (foot/ankle) in Houston's backfield this season, producing a 121-505-3 rushing line across 15 active games. With Marks potentially returning in Week 17, Chubb's value is limited to deep formats for Saturday's tilt against the Chargers.
</div>

### 🟢 Quentin Johnston (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Johnston was exceptional after missing the previous week due to a groin injury. The 2023 first-round pick had just 16 catches for 156 yards over the past seven games as Los Angeles struggled to adapt after a litany of offensive-line injuries. Thankfully for fantasy managers, Dallas presented absolutely zero issues for Justin Herbert, setting the stage for Johnston's massive game. It's hard to imagine Johnston putting together another significant day Week 17 against the fearsome Texans defense, but he's undoubtedly a key piece for the offense in terms of the deep-play threat he poses.
</div>

### 🟢 Malik Washington (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> After catching multiple passes in 13 of his first 14 games, Washington has now posted back-to-back one-catch games on a total of two targets. Washington, however, was able to salvage his box score with a nine-yard rushing score in the second quarter to give the Dolphins a 14-10 lead. Cincinnati would then go on to score 35 straight points to bury the Dolphins. Washington has minimal fantasy appeal headed into next Sunday's date with Tampa Bay.
</div>

### 🟢 Justin Jefferson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jefferson's 57 first-half yards were already good for his second-highest full-game total in the past eight outings. J.J. McCarthy (hand) exited late in the first half, and Jefferson accounted for 28 of Max Brosmer's 52 passing yards after halftime. Jefferson's floor will continue to be far lower than he's accustomed to due to questionable quarterback play Thursday against the Lions, whether the Vikings get McCarthy back under center or start Brosmer.
</div>

### 🟢 Theo Johnson (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Johnson was a non-factor as Jaxson Dart threw for just 33 yards. Prior to Sunday's goose egg, Johnson had caught at least three passes in eight consecutive games. Johnson will likely be more involved if the Giants turn to a more balanced approach in Week 17 against the Raiders after this run-heavy loss.
</div>

### 🟡 Justin Fields (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 Aaron Rodgers (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Steelers were uncharacteristically pass-heavy for the entire matchup, leading to a season-high 41 attempts for Rodgers. Even facing an injury-riddled Lions' secondary, he didn't deliver a big statistical line. Rodgers completed only two passes of 20 yards, the longest of which was a 45-yard touchdown to Kenneth Gainwell, though it was primarily the result of an excellent individual effort by Gainwell. Despite it not being his strongest performance, Rodgers has performed better of late, as he's now reached 220 passing yards in three straight games while accounting for a total of five touchdowns with no turnovers in that span.
</div>

### 🟢 Chris Godwin Jr. (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Godwin was able to draw even with Mike Evans for the team lead in receptions and was second to his teammate in targets, but he once again was contained to a very modest yardage total. Godwin has eclipsed 55 receiving yards just once in seven games, making him a risky fantasy proposition in a Week 17 road matchup against the Dolphins despite the favorable matchup.
</div>

### 🟡 Marcus Mariota (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> On track to be listed as a non-participant on the second consecutive Commanders practice report, Mariota would appear to be unlikely to be available to play Thursday against the Cowboys. In preparation of a potential Mariota absence for Week 17, the Commanders signed Jeff Driskel off the Cardinals' practice squad Monday to bolster their depth at quarterback. Driskel appears in line to serve as the backup Thursday to Josh Johnson, who came on in relief for a banged-up Mariota in this past Saturday's 29-18 loss to the Eagles.
