## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 DeAndre Hopkins (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Baltimore's passing game was limited under the direction of Cooper Rush and Tyler Huntley on Sunday, but an underlying detail from the game was Hopkins' playing time ticking up. Hopkins played a season-high 26 snaps, which was good for 33 percent of the plays. He also had a season-high four targets. Baltimore is on a bye in Week 7, but given that Hopkins has been excellent on a per-target basis (13.7 YPT), it would not be surprising to see his role continue on an upward trend, especially when Lamar Jackson returns.
</div>

### 🟡 Chuba Hubbard (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Hubbard has now logged back-to-back limited practice sessions, and he said Thursday that he plans to suit up for Sunday's game at the Jets, per David Newton of ESPN.com. Rico Dowdle has been sensational as the Panthers' fill-in starter across the span of Hubbard's two-game absence, however, so it remains to be seen who backfield snaps will be divvied up if both players take the field Week 7. If Hubbard can upgrade to a full practice session Friday, he could avoid an injury designation entirely for Sunday's contest.
</div>

### 🟢 Dalton Schultz (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Schultz was C.J. Stroud's favorite target in the first half, recording four receptions on four targets for 53 yards. Schultz played a key role on multiple scoring drives for Houston, recording 11- and 12-yard receptions to keep a pair of possessions alive on third down before logging a 21-yard catch to set up a touchdown just before halftime. This was Schultz's highest yardage total of the season, and he has five receptions in three consecutive contests.
</div>

### 🟡 Josh Downs (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Downs didn't practice Wednesday either, so what (if anything) the wideout is able to do Friday will loom large in terms of his Week 7 status. With Ashton Dulin (chest) also having missed back-to-back sessions, Michael Pittman, Alec Pierce, Adonai Mitchell and Anthony Gould are currently the Colts' healthy options at the WR position.
</div>

### 🟢 Travis Etienne Jr. (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Etienne was absolutely stonewalled on the ground by a talented Seahawks front seven, although he was able to partly atone for the shortfall with a solid day through the air that saw him post new season highs in receptions, receiving yards and targets. The fifth-year back now has back-to-back 12-carry tallies after opening the season with at least 14 rush attempts in each of the first four games, but he remains the Jaguars' unquestioned No. 1 back and next faces a Rams defense that was gashed by the Ravens' Derrick Henry in Week 6.
</div>

### 🟢 Hassan Haskins (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Haskins was supposed to be part of a committee with Kimani Vidal replacing the injured Omarion Hampton (IR, ankle), but Vidal quickly proved to be the far more explosive back and ran away with the workload in the second half, finishing with 124 rushing yards and 14 receiving yards plus a touchdown. That's about as definitive of a difference as one could envision and likely means Haskins, who has primarily been a special-teams player during his time with the Chargers, could get squeezed out of platoon work after Vidal's amazing efforts. It's worth noting Miami's run defense is one of the worst in the league, and the Chargers could lean on the bruising Michigan product in short-yardage situations in future weeks.
</div>

### 🟢 Matthew Stafford (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Stafford had a fairly efficient performance, but it was a tough day for the Rams' offense as a whole. They possessed the ball for only 22:05 while also running their offense with a hobbled Puka Nacua (ankle) for nearly three-quarters of the contest. As a result, Stafford failed to throw for multiple touchdowns for the first time since Week 1 and also turned in his lowest yardage total of the season. His outlook for Week 7 against the Jaguars will depend relatively heavily on Nacua's availability.
</div>

### 🟢 Rhamondre Stevenson (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The fifth-year RB avoided committing another fumble, but that was about the only silver lining to his performance. Stevenson has failed to reach 40 rushing yards in four straight games, producing a woeful 2.7 YPC over that stretch, and only a couple Week 5 rushing TDs have salvaged any real fantasy value for him during that span. TreVeyon Henderson hasn't had much more success, so the duo will likely continue to work in a timeshare in Week 7 against the Titans.
</div>

### 🟢 Spencer Rattler (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The second-year QB didn't commit a turnover for the fifth time in six starts to begin the season, but Rattler also wasn't able to produce a touchdown as the Saints had to settle for four Blake Grupe field goals, as well as a one-yard TD run from Taysom Hill. Rattler's 8.7 YPA on Sunday was a season high, as were his 227 passing yards. He'll take a 6:1 TD:INT into a Week 7 matchup against the Bears.
</div>

### 🟢 A.J. Brown (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> This comes with the territory for a big market team that's the defending Super Bowl champs, but the drama surrounding the Eagles' key offensive players has been exhausting. However, it's prudent to remember how the Eagles' offense was also off-kilter at this point in the season last year, too.
</div>

### 🟢 Cooper Kupp (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Kupp got into the end zone for the first time as a member of the Seahawks, recording an 11-yard touchdown grab early in the third quarter. The veteran wideout remains a distant No. 2 in the offense's pecking order behind No. 1 receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba, who had another prolific afternoon Sunday and has logged 56 targets to Kupp's 32. Kupp has now been under 60 receiving yards for four straight games heading into a challenging Week 7 home matchup against the Texans on Monday night, Oct. 20.
</div>

### 🟢 Sam Darnold (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Darnold looked as impressive as usual outside the friendly confines of Lumen Field, averaging 10.9 yards per attempt as he remained aggressive downfield. The veteran signal-caller once again focused the majority of his attention on Jaxon Smith-Njigba, who ended up on the receiving end of half of Darnold's completions and 162 of his yards, not to mention one of his two touchdowns, a perfectly thrown 61-yard strike in the second quarter. Darnold added a nifty 11-yard scoring toss to Cooper Kupp in the fourth quarter, and he'll head into a Week 7 home clash with the Texans on Monday night, Oct. 20 having thrown for multiple touchdowns in four of the last five games.
</div>

### 🟢 Jaxon Smith-Njigba (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Smith-Njigba was in the familiar position of leading the Seahawks' air attack in receptions, receiving yards and targets, posting a new season high in the middle category along the way. His catch total also tied for second highest of the season, and he added three more grabs of 20-plus yards, the most prominent a 61-yard touchdown on a beautifully thrown ball from QB Sam Darnold. The third-year star now has back-to-back 100-yard tallies for the second time this season and takes a robust 42-696-3 receiving line into a Week 7 home matchup against the Texans on Monday night, Oct. 20.
