## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Bijan Robinson (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Robinson failed to replicate last week's two-score effort against the Panthers, but he stayed above the century mark in total yards with an efficient day as both a runner and receiver. Backfield mate Tyler Allgeier garnered 13 touches, but his production was dwarfed by Atlanta's starter after finishing with just 49 yards from scrimmage. Robinson's success with QB Kirk Cousins under center Sunday helped quell concerns from fantasy managers regarding a potential dip in production after Michael Penix (knee) was placed on injured reserve this past week. Robinson should continue to be treated as an RB1 in fantasy for next Sunday's favorable matchup against the Jets.
</div>

### 🟢 Xavier Legette (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Legette tied with Jalen Coker for second in receptions on the Panthers for the night, although that equated to very modest yardage during what was an uninspiring performance for Bryce Young. Legette was coming off his second-highest receiving yardage total (83) of the season in Week 11 against the Falcons, so Monday night's downturn was particularly glaring. Legette next faces a talented Rams secondary in a Week 13 home matchup Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Colston Loveland (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Loveland finished second in receptions and third in receiving yards for the Bears on the afternoon, and he also recorded the third touchdown reception of his career on a 12-yard grab late in the first half. Loveland's production has started to enjoy some stability, as he's now posted at least 40 receiving yards in four straight contests. The talented tight end next takes aim at the talented Eagles defense in a Week 13 road matchup on Black Friday.
</div>

### 🟢 Dylan Sampson (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Sampson scored a 66-yard touchdown on a screen pass in the fourth quarter, accounting for Shedeur Sanders' first NFL touchdown pass. Rookie second-round pick Quinshon Judkins scored two rushing touchdowns and continues to work ahead of Sampson, who was drafted two rounds later. Sampson has struggled on the ground, averaging only 2.3 yards per carry (89 yards on 38 attempts), but he has shown some upside as a pass catcher out of the backfield heading into a Week 13 home game against the 49ers.
</div>

### 🟢 Jaydon Blue (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The running back is now a healthy scratch for the third consecutive game. Blue has been the third running back on Dallas' depth chart since committing a fumble in Week 8, with Malik Davis taking his spot behind starter Javonte Williams. Blue has also gained just 65 yards on 22 carries this year.
</div>

### 🟢 Bo Nix (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> It was the first time all season Nix had failed to produce a TD, but his 295 passing yards were his highest total since Week 4, and the second-year QB came through when it mattered most, hitting Troy Franklin for a 32-yard gain inside the final minute of the fourth quarter to set up Wil Lutz's game-winning FG. Nix will head into the Broncos' Week 12 bye riding an eight-game win streak that has them firmly in control of the AFC West, two games ahead of the Chargers and four wins clear of KC.
</div>

### 🟡 Kalif Raymond (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Raymond was forced out of Detroit's overtime win over the Giants in Week 12 late in the third quarter, and he was unable to return to that contest. As a result, veteran wideout's status for Thursday's divisional matchup against the Packers looks genuinely uncertain. If Raymond is unable to suit up on a short week, rookie third-round pick Isaac TeSlaa (hand) could benefit from increased opportunities behind top receivers Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jameson Williams.
</div>

### 🟢 Parker Washington (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Washington didn't see his first target of the game until deep into the second quarter, and he recorded all of his catches and yards after halftime. His seven targets ended up pacing Jacksonville's offense. Washington caught a nine-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter to give the Jaguars a 24-21 lead with 3:47 to play in regulation. It's been a breakout 2025 season for Washington, who has already set career highs in targets (60), catches (35) and yards (421) with his three scores. Washington's fantasy appeal moving forward is largely tied to Brian Thomas' (ankle) availability.
</div>

### 🟢 Brashard Smith (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Smith continued his role as the de facto No. 2 running back in Week 11 with Isiah Pacheco (knee) sidelined, but he was not a major part of the Chiefs' offensive plans in the contest. The rookie played 12 of Kansas City's 70 offensive snaps, while teammate Kareem Hunt dominated the backfield snap share with 56 snaps. Week 11 marked just the third time this season that Smith did not handle a single carry. Despite the Chiefs praising the SMU product for his playmaking ability earlier in the season, the team has not seemed committed to using him more in Pacheco's absence. Smith remains difficult to trust for fantasy purposes, even if Pacheco remains sidelined for a Week 12 matchup against the Colts.
</div>

### 🟢 Geno Smith (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Smith actually finished with decent results from a fantasy perspective when factoring in his inconsistent play to date, coupled with the brutal matchup on paper. The veteran signal-caller's poor decision-making and inaccuracy on deep attempts ultimately cost his team a shot at victory, but this was far from his worst fantasy score through 11 starts this year. Smith has thrown as many touchdowns as interceptions (13) over his disappointing run as the Raiders' starter, with Sunday's lost fumble keeping his TD:TO below 1.0. Fantasy managers should be wary of next Sunday's opponent after the Chargers picked off Smith three times when these two teams met back in Week 2.
</div>

### 🟢 Kyren Williams (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Williams finished with his lowest fantasy score of the season in a contest the Rams led comfortably from wire to wire. Los Angeles' ground game was marginalized as Matthew Stafford, Puka Nacua and Davante Adams systematically dismantled Tampa Bay's defense through the air. Williams still finished as his team's leading rusher after Blake Corum was held to 24 yards on seven carries in the primetime win. The 24-year-old Williams has provided steady production for fantasy managers with 980 yards from scrimmage and nine total touchdowns through 11 starts in 2025. Williams will attempt to bounce back from Sunday's down game when the Rams visit the Panthers in Week 13.
</div>

### 🟢 Puka Nacua (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Nacua finished the one-sided affair as the Rams' leading receiver on a team-high 11 targets, but he took a back seat to teammate Davante Adams in the scoring department after the latter cashed in a pair of Matthew Stafford's three touchdown strikes on Sunday Night Football. The 24-year-old Nacua has seen his elite production dip ever so slightly since Los Angeles' Week 8 bye after failing to crack 100 yards from scrimmage in all four appearances over that span. To put things into perspective, the BYU product had accomplished that feat four times in the six games predating the bye. Nacua is still on track to have an elite fantasy campaign, as he currently sits just 53 yards shy of a 1,000-yard receiving season in just 10 games played.
</div>

### 🟢 Tank Bigsby (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The third-year back from Auburn played just three offensive snaps in the Week 12 loss, his lowest total since the Week 6 loss to the Giants. Bigsby has appeared in 10 games since joining the Eagles in early September, rushing 18 times for 164 yards while also accumulating 187 kickoff-return yards. He's expected to continue operating as the team's No. 2 running back in the Week 13 matchup against the Bears.
</div>

### 🟢 Cade Otton (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Otton led the Buccaneers in receptions while tying for second in receiving yards for the Buccaneers on the night. Otton logged his usual hefty snap share -- 86 percent (60 snaps) -- but with Baker Mayfield exiting the game early due to a shoulder injury and Teddy Bridgewater similarly struggling to get much going through the air, the tight end's yardage total was his lowest since Week 4. Given Otton's usual shorter-area role, the tight end shouldn't see much of a downgrade in outlook if Bridgewater is forced to make a spot start in Week 13 against the Cardinals.
</div>

### 🟢 Emeka Egbuka (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Egbuka was held to 40 or fewer yards for the third time in his last four games, though it's difficult to hold this showing against him as the entire Tampa Bay offense struggled. Egbuka's lone impactful play came early in the fourth quarter on a deep 32-yard reception on a pass delivered by Teddy Bridgewater. Egbuka should be in for a more favorable matchup in Week 13 against Arizona, though his outlook will depend heavily on Baker Mayfield's (shoulder) health.
</div>

### 🟢 Deebo Samuel (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The veteran wideout scored Washington's only TD of the day on a 20-yard catch-and-run in the third quarter. Samuel has gotten into the end zone in back-to-back games, and he'll take a 53-470-5 line on 68 targets for the season into the Commanders' Week 12 bye. He's also chipped in 52 yards and a touchdown on the ground.
