## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Trey Benson (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Injured Reserve<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> It was an outcome that seemed likely once Benson was held out of practice Thursday. The Cardinals listed him as a limited participant in four straight practices beforehand, but head coach Jonathan Gannon told Urban on Friday that Benson is still being evaluated day to day. The Cardinals figure to deploy Bam Knight (knee) and Michael Carter out of the backfield with Emari Demercado (ankle) also out this Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Drake London (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Out<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> London has missed the previous two games with his sprained PCL, but it sounds like he could be nearing a return to the lineup. The 4-8 Falcons don't have much to play for these days, so rushing London back at less than 100 percent in what's become a lost season doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Morris, however, may be feeling the pressure to get some late-season wins, and London would certainly help the Falcons be competitive. Playing with Kirk Cousins and at less than 100 percent would knock London down the wide receiver rankings in fantasy.
</div>

### 🟢 Justice Hill (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Injured Reserve<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Hill was apparently injured in practice last week and was placed on injured reserve ahead of last Thursday night's game against the Bengals. He'll miss at least three more contests while on IR, but it sounds like he'll have a chance to return when eligible Week 17. Keaton Mitchell and Rasheen Ali will continue to handle backup duties behind Derrick Henry for the next few weeks.
</div>

### 🟢 Joshua Palmer (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Out<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> After logging a limited practice Wednesday, Palmer was a 'DNP' a day later, before returning to limited session Friday and being deemed questionable for Sunday's contest. In his absence Sunday, Khalil Shakir, Brandin Cooks, Keon Coleman, Gabe Davis and Tyrell Shavers will handle Buffalo's Week 13 WR duties.
</div>

### 🟢 Courtland Sutton (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Sutton put it all together for his best receiving line since Week 4 of the regular season when he finished with five receptions for 81 yards and a touchdown against the Bengals. The 29-year-old had registered just one touchdown grab over his previous seven appearances, so fantasy managers were delighted to see the wideout secure Bo Nix's lone touchdown pass in the primetime win. It was also a positive sign to see the veteran starter usurp Troy Franklin (2-21-0) in production after the inverse had held true in recent weeks. With a 50-711-5 receiving line across 12 starts, Sutton is providing enough value to stick in most fantasy lineups for a soft matchup against the Raiders next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Jakobi Meyers (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Meyers continues to build rapport with Trevor Lawrence, and he was clearly the Jaguars' best receiver in Sunday's blowout win. He may have benefitted from the departure of Parker Washington (hip) with a few extra targets in the second half, though Meyers accounted for most of his production before Washington's absence. He caught a deep pass over the middle of the field late in the first quarter that went for 50 yards, and he capped off the same drive with a three-yard touchdown reception. Meyers also chipped in a 13-yard catch just before halftime to help set up a field goal, and he now has at least four receptions and 50 yards in each of his last three games while also finding the end zone in consecutive contests.
</div>

### 🟢 Trevor Lawrence (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Lawrence and the Jaguars pounced on the Titans on back-to-back possessions early in the contest, both of which concluded with Lawrence delivering passing scores. On Jacksonville's second offensive possession, he delivered a 50-yard deep pass to Jakobi Meyers and then found Meyers for a three-yard score three plays later. The Titans fumbled the ensuing kickoff, which set up a Lawrence to Brenton Strange touchdown connection from 21 yards away. Jacksonville didn't need to push much from there offensively, but Lawrence still managed one of his more efficient showings of the season and tallied only his fourth game with multiple passing scores.
</div>

### 🟢 Hollywood Brown (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Brown has four or fewer targets in seven straight games, after getting five or more in each of Kansas City's first five contests. He's been efficient with his limited chances, but his snap shares have landed between 33 and 44 percent each week since Rashee Rice returned from suspension. Brown figures to continue in his part-time role Week 14 against Houston.
</div>

### 🟡 Aaron Jones Sr. (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jones sustained a shoulder injury on a lost fumble in the middle of the third quarter of Sunday's loss at Seattle and wasn't able to return, finishing Week 13 with six carries for three yards and four catches (on four targets) for 22 yards. He's been playing through a shoulder issue since Week 10, so his ability to suit up and ultimately what kind of workload he can hold moving forward may come down to pain management. Jordan Mason and Zavier Scott are the next players up out of Minnesota's backfield if Jones cedes any reps or ultimately is inactive Sunday against the Commanders.
</div>

### 🟢 Saquon Barkley (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Barkley was fairly efficient on the ground in a change from his recent form, as six of his 13 carries went for at least five yards. However, with the Eagles trailing for much of the game, Barkley saw limited volume, leading to a muted stat line. He also failed to record a reception in a game for the first time this season. Overall, this marked Barkley's ninth performance in 12 games this season with 60 rushing yards or fewer, and he hasn't found the end zone since Week 8.
</div>

### 🟢 George Kittle (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The veteran tight end led the Niners in receiving yards and tied Jauan Jennings for the team lead in catches on a day in which passing was difficult due to high winds in Cleveland. Kittle has caught at least four passes in six straight games, racking up a 33-371-4 line on 39 targets during that stretch. He'll get a breather during San Francisco's bye next week before taking on Tennessee in Week 15.
</div>

### 🟢 Brock Purdy (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> High winds in Cleveland made passing difficult, but Purdy was able to connect with Jauan Jennings for a seven-yard score in the fourth quarter after the QB ran in a two-yard touchdown of his own in the third. The rushing score was Purdy's first in three starts since returning from a toe injury and is the best sign yet that he's fully healthy. He'll get a bye to rest up next week before the 49ers host the Titans in Week 15.
</div>

### 🟢 Rashid Shaheed (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Shaheed was once again a non-factor on offense in Week 13, reeling in a pass for seven yards in the second quarter. After securing at least four passes in all nine of his contests with the Saints prior to being traded, the wide receiver has had only one multi-reception performance with Seattle, catching four of 11 targets for 37 yards over four games with the team. Shaheed will look to be more involved on offense in Week 14 against Atlanta.
</div>

### 🟢 Tony Pollard (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Pollard was the Titans' traditional lead back, totaling 10 carries compared to only one for Tyjae Spears. He was one of the few bright spots in the Tennessee offense, with three of his 10 carries going for double-digit yards. While Pollard ceded opportunity to Spears as a receiver, this was his highest yardage total on the ground since Week 5. Despite the positivity, Pollard is difficult to trust as a fantasy starter given the state of the Titans' offense.
</div>

### 🟢 Zach Ertz (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Ertz has enjoyed increased production with Marcus Mariota under center, and he led the Commanders in both receptions and yards. In contrast to past weeks, he was used both deep down the field and in short areas, logging long receptions of 21 and 18 yards to help him top 100 receiving yards for the first time since Week 9 of the 2019 campaign. Ertz now has at least four receptions in five consecutive games. While he could be in for a downturn in opportunity moving forward due to the return of Terry McLaurin, Ertz was prioritized ahead of Deebo Samuel for targets in Sunday's loss.
