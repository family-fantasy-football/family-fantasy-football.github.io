## Player Report

#### Kyler Murray (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Murray and the Cardinals' offense looked to be in for a big performance, as they put up 21 points within the first 17 minutes of game time. He accounted for one of those scores with a 12-yard rushing touchdown by out-racing the defense to the right sideline. It was an odd performance from there, however, as the Arizona offensive play-calling became passive, and Murray also missed a few plays in the third quarter with a foot injury. The end result was a relatively muted stat line, including his first game this season without a passing score.
#### Darnell Mooney (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Mooney was forced out of Sunday's 34-27 win over the Commanders early in the third quarter due to a hamstring injury, but he's not expected to miss any further time. He secured his only target for 16 yards before exiting Sunday's contest. Mooney also missed Week 1 due to a shoulder injury, and across his three appearances this season he's tallied just seven catches for 79 yards on 16 targets.
#### Kyle Pitts Sr. (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The tight end put together his best game of the season as QB Michael Penix posted career-best passing numbers, with Pitts hauling in his first TD of the year on a seven-yard toss in the third quarter. Pitts has seen at least five targets in every game so far and delivered a 20-205-1 line on 24 targets heading into Atlanta's Week 5 bye, putting him on pace for his best campaign since his stunning NFL debut in 2021.
#### Mark Andrews (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** The Ravens were able to muster very little offense with Cooper Rush at the helm, and Andrews' line suffered. There were still a few positives to take away from his role, as he tied for second on the team in targets and was more involved than Isaiah Likely. Lamar Jackson's (hamstring) potential return in Week 6 would significantly improve Andrews' outlook.
#### Keon Coleman (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Coleman finished second on the team with seven targets, though he struggled to an inefficient performance like many of Buffalo's skill-position players. Both of his notable catches came in the fourth quarter, starting with a two-yard touchdown reception midway through the period. One possession later, he made a leaping, contested grab that went for 13 yards to help set up a game-tying field goal. While Coleman made key contributions for the team, he now has fewer than 30 receiving yards in three of five games for the season.
#### Tetairoa McMillan (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** McMillan led the Panthers in receptions, receiving yards and targets in what is becoming a customary occurrence for the talented rookie. The 2025 first-round pick equaled his career high in receptions while posting his second-highest yardage total to date, and he recorded multiple catches of 20-plus yards for the third time in five contests. The chemistry between McMillan and Bryce Young continues to grow by the game, and the duo will draw a favorable matchup at home against the Cowboys in Week 6 next Sunday afternoon.
#### Luther Burden III (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Aside from Burden's 101-yard effort in Week 3 against the woeful Dallas defense, he has a total of minus-three yards in his other three games. Until his role in the offense grows, Burden's floor makes him difficult to place in fantasy lineups.
#### Javonte Williams (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** The former Bronco is having a breakout campaign in Dallas. Williams recorded his first triple-digit rushing performance since Week 13 of his rookie season in 2021, and his first receiving score since Week 10 of 2023, in Sunday's victory. He's now found the end zone six times in his first five games as a Cowboy while racking up 525 scrimmage yards, giving him massive momentum heading into a Week 6 clash with the Panthers.
#### Josh Jacobs (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Jacobs had only 48 yards at halftime, but he found more room to work as both a runner and receiver in the second half. The highlight of his performance was an 18-yard touchdown early in the fourth quarter, which was one of his three ground gains of 10-plus yards. Jacobs also made an impact as a pass catcher, surpassing 70 receiving yards for the fourth time in his career and second time as a Packer. Sunday night's performance was also the first time he surpassed 100 total yards in a game this season, though he has found the end zone in three of four contests.
#### Nick Chubb (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Chubb looked to be losing his grip as the clear leader of the Houston backfield after Week 4, though he out-touched rookie Woody Marks 11-7 in Sunday's blowout win. Despite Baltimore playing without several of their run-stopping defenders, Chubb was held in check for much of the day. However, he broke loose for a 27-yard touchdown scamper early in the third quarter to account for nearly half of his yardage. The positive game script likely benefitted Chubb relative to Marks, but it appears clear that Chubb will continue to retain a role in the offense in the short term.
#### Quentin Johnston (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Johnston coughed up a momentum-killing fumble to end a lengthy drive in the second quarter that derailed both his and his team's days. The Commanders took over in their territory and promptly drove the ball down the field for a touchdown on the ensuing possession, and the Chargers never recovered. Johnston still finished second in receiving yards for his club on a low-volume passing day. Managers may opt to chalk this up as a dud and continue rolling out the breakout fantasy star in a soft matchup against the Dolphins next Sunday.
#### Carson Wentz (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Wentz exited the game with a left shoulder injury late in the second quarter, although he technically only missed the end-of-half kneel-down play before returning to start the second half. The veteran quarterback's presence would end up proving critical in the Vikings' comeback win, as Wentz battled through the injury and a ferocious Browns pass rush to ultimately helm a game-winning 10-play, 80-yard march that he capped off with a 12-yard touchdown pass to Jordan Addison. Wentz went a blistering 9-for-9 on that final drive, capping off what might have been the final installment of his current starting tenure in fine fashion. Minnesota now heads into a Week 6 bye, and J.J. McCarthy (ankle) may be ready to return to action when the Eagles pay a visit for a Week 7 matchup on Sunday, Oct. 19.
#### Justin Jefferson (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Jefferson paced the Vikings in receptions, receiving yards and targets on the day, turning in his second consecutive 100-yard effort in the process. His final reception of the contest was especially critical, as he came down with a 21-yard grab to take the ball to the Browns' 27 yard-line with under two minutes remaining on Minnesota's game-winning drive. Jefferson has displayed excellent chemistry with fill-in signal-caller Carson Wentz over the last pair of contests, but J.J. McCarthy (ankle) may be set to return to action when the Vikings come out of a Week 6 bye to host the Eagles on Sunday, Oct. 19.
#### TreVeyon Henderson (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Henderson finished as New England's leading rusher as part of a three-player committee, but it was Rhamondre Stevenson who cashed in both of the team's short rushing scores Sunday. The latter also coughed up his third fumble of the season, which could cut into Stevenson's playing time even after making two trips to the end zone. That potential scenario could open up more touches for Henderson going forward, though so far he has seen his fantasy value thwarted by the three-way timeshare. Until he has an uptick in usage, the second-round rookie will be stuck as a deep-league option.
#### Malik Nabers (WR)
**Injury Status:** Injured Reserve <br>
**Lineup Slot:** IR <br>
**Details:** Nabers tore both his ACL and meniscus during the second quarter of the Giants' Week 4 win over the Chargers. Schefter adds that the time off will allow Nabers to also recover from a partially torn labrum in his shoulder as well as a bout with turf toe, and the 2024 first-round pick is expected to return for the start of training camp in July. Wan'Dale Robinson, Darius Slayton, Jalin Hyatt and tight end Theo Johnson are expected to serve as the primary targets for rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart in Nabers' absence.
#### Justin Fields (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** His final numbers look good, but both TDs came in the fourth quarter after the game was well out of reach, and the Dallas pass rush gave Fields fits all afternoon as he got sacked five times and took another nine QB hits. Fields has produced multiple scores in back-to-back games since returning from a concussion, but he'll remain a volatile fantasy option in Week 6 against a tough Broncos defense.
