## Player Report

#### Cooper Rush (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Rush led the Ravens on a decent first drive that resulted in a field goal, completing all five of his pass attempts for 59 yards. Things imploded from there, however, as the Ravens turned in consecutive three-and-outs to end the first half before Rush threw three picks in the final two quarters. The one positive is that Rush was able to complete a long pass to Zay Flowers, salvaging the star receiver's fantasy day. Rush could be lined up for a Week 6 start against the Rams, pending Lamar Jackson's (hamstring) recovery.
#### Dalton Kincaid (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Buffalo's offense looked out of sync for much of the game, but Kincaid was a bright spot. He recorded the first 100-yard receiving performance of his career in both regular-season and postseason contests, powered by a very efficient effort on six targets. Kincaid caught three passes of at least 20 yards, matching his total from the first four games of the season. Kincaid has also earned exactly six targets in three of his last four games, making him reliably involved in one of the most efficient offenses in the league.
#### DJ Moore (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The 28-year-old took a back seat to Rome Odunze (4-69-1) yet again, as a changing of the guard appears to have taken place in Chicago's receiver room. Moore still possesses a consistent role in new head coach Ben Johnson's offense, garnering five to six targets on a weekly basis, but expectations need to be tempered even if QB Caleb Williams takes a big step forward coming out of Chicago's upcoming Week 5 bye.
#### Tee Higgins (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Higgins was unable to record a catch on his first three targets and had only seven yards for the first 55 minutes of game time. He saved his day with a 13-yard catch followed by a two-yard touchdown grab late in the fourth quarter, but it was another disastrous day for the Bengals' offense led by Jake Browning. Despite his undeniable talent, Higgins is a risky fantasy start every week, but particularly heading into a Week 6 matchup against the Packers.
#### Jake Browning (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Browning's final line looks relatively positive, but he threw three interceptions by early in the third quarter that led directly to 14 points for the Lions. He salvaged his performance late in the contest with the help of heroics from Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins, connecting with the duo for scores of 15, 64 and two yards. To add a final insult to the day, Browning was sacked for a safety to conclude the Bengals' final possession. While he looked to be one of the better backups in the league for the final seven games of 2023, Browning has six touchdowns as compared to eight interceptions while averaging only 6.1 yards per attempt in four games this season.
#### Jerome Ford (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Ford's seven touches on offense, 38 yards from scrimmage and 116 combined yards were his most since Week 2, when he was still a factor before Quinshon Judkins became the lead running back. Cleveland's switch to rookie quarterback Dillon Gabriel was the reason for Ford's increased touches. To make life easier on Gabriel, the Browns deployed a run-heavy offense and had a 50-50 split between rushes and pass attempts. They also got right tackle Jack Conklin back, which helped Cleveland amass a season-high 140 yards on the ground. Barring a Judkins injury, Ford's days as the lead back are over, but Sunday's gameplan showed how the Browns' offense can be competitive.
#### Christian Kirk (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Kirk had his best day as a Texan due primarily to a 47-yard catch to start the fourth quarter, narrowly missing a touchdown while being taken down at the three-yard line. Houston has spread its targets relatively evenly between several different pass catchers early this season, leaving Kirk with only four targets in consecutive games. That limited volume will hurt his fantasy outlook, though Sunday's big play was encouraging.
#### C.J. Stroud (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Stroud faced a thinned version of the Baltimore defense that was missing Kyle Hamilton (groin), Marlon Humphrey (calf) and Chidobe Awuzie (hamstring) in its secondary alone. He took advantage of the good spot, throwing more than three touchdowns for only the second time in his career while completing three passes of at least 20 yards. Stroud was ultimately pulled early in the fourth quarter due to the game being a blowout, but it was a positive fantasy performance and also a good showing for the Houston offense overall.
#### J.J. McCarthy (QB)
**Injury Status:** Out <br>
**Lineup Slot:** IR <br>
**Details:** The Vikings were hopeful McCarthy would be able to return to practice this week, but he still hasn't taken part in any on-field work since sustaining a right high-ankle sprain in the team's Week 2 loss to the Falcons. With McCarthy still sidelined, Carson Wentz is slated to draw a third straight start at quarterback Sunday. O'Connell has previously said McCarthy will need a full week of practice before he can return to action, though it's not clear if the second-year signal-caller will regain the starting job once he's formally cleared. After the bye week, the Vikings will host the Eagles in Week 7 on Oct. 19.
#### DeMario Douglas (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Douglas, who was on the field for 17 of a possible 60 snaps on offense, per Mike Reiss of ESPN.com, was out-snapped in the contest by fellow WRs Kayshon Boutte (37), Mack Hollins (35) and Stefon Diggs (30). With just seven catches for 30 yards and a TD (on 16 targets) in five games, Douglas is off the lineup radar in all but the deepest of fantasy formats.
#### Juwan Johnson (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The tight end produced his worst numbers of 2025, and while the returns of Taysom Hill and Foster Moreau from knee injuries didn't cut into Johnson's workload at all -- he was on the field for 56 offensive snaps (85 percent) -- Spencer Rattler and the Saints' offense did make an effort to attack downfield more than they had in the first month of the year. That change may have had more to do with the quality of the Giants' secondary than it did any growth in Rattler's game, but the window for Johnson to be a reliable fantasy option may be closing rapidly. He'll try to bounce back in Week 6 against the Patriots.
#### Breece Hall (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** The running back briefly left the game in the first half after fumbling in the red zone late in the second quarter, but Hall returned in the second half and racked up some big yardage once again in a losing effort. The 113 rushing yards were a season high for the fourth-year RB, as were the 42 receiving yards, but he's still looking for his first touchdown of 2025 -- something he came agonizing close to in the fourth quarter, when he was tackled just short of the goal line on a 16-yard reception. Hall will look to get into the end zone in Week 6 against a Broncos defense that just gave up a 47-yard receiving TD to Saquon Barkley, but otherwise held him in check.
#### Dallas Goedert (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Goedert was surprisingly second on the Eagles in targets, but he had the third-fewest receiving yards during an inefficient afternoon against a tough Denver defense. Nevertheless, Goedert got into the end zone for the third time in the last two games on a two-yard catch just past the halfway point of the second quarter. Goedert has all four of his touchdowns this season in the last three games, and although he's averaging only 8.9 yards per reception, he remains an intriguing option at his position for a favorable road Week 6 matchup against the Giants on Thursday night.
#### Zach Charbonnet (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Charbonnet finished with one less carry than Kenneth Walker (10-86-0) in the loss, but it was the former who punched in Seattle's only rushing score of the contest. The 24-year-old Charbonnet received seven fewer carries than the starter in his return from a foot injury in Week 4, but Sunday's near-even split in touches indicates a potential timeshare moving forward. If that trend holds true, then Charbonnet would see a slight bump in value at Walker's expense heading into next Sunday's tilt against the Jaguars.
#### Kenneth Walker III (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Walker led Seattle in both carries and rushing production in Week 5, but it was backfield mate Zach Charbonnet (9-36-1) who cashed in the team's only rushing score in the loss. The touch distribution was far closer this time around compared to last week's seven-carry difference in the latter's return from injury, confirming the timeshare that exists when both runners are at full strength. Both players are worthy of flex spots in Week 6, even in a timeshare, with Walker being the preferred option for his early-down usage.
#### Terry McLaurin (WR)
**Injury Status:** Out <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** inactive
