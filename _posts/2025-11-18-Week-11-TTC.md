## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Rico Dowdle (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Although he didn't find the end zone and averaged just 2.3 yards per carry, Dowdle still notched his fourth 100-yard performance of the season in the Week 11 win. The Panthers' didn't lean on the rushing attack as heavily as usual, as quarterback Bryce Young had a career day with 448 passing yards and three touchdowns. Dowdle has now received 20 or more touches in five of Carolina's last seven games, reinforcing his role as a workhorse back. He'll look to improve his efficiency in a favorable Week 12 matchup against a 49ers defense that's struggled as of late.
</div>

### 🟢 Bryce Young (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Young sustained an ankle injury after taking a sack in the first quarter, but he didn't miss an offensive snap in Sunday's win. The Alabama product delivered his best game as a pro, setting a new career high in passing yards en route to a 14-point comeback victory. He showed great chemistry with wideouts Tetairoa McMillan and Xavier Legette (hip), completing 12 of 20 passes for 213 yards and three touchdowns to that duo. Young has now thrown for 1,962 yards, 14 touchdowns and seven interceptions while leading the Panthers to second place in the NFC South. He could be a viable streaming option against a struggling 49ers defense in Week 12.
</div>

### 🟢 Chase Brown (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Brown has rushed for at least 73 yards in three of his last four games after failing to exceed 47 rushing yards in a game through Week 6. He handled a workhorse role in the absence of top backup Samaje Perine (ankle), as Brown set season highs with 24 touches and 127 scrimmage yards. After a slow start, Brown has started to deliver the gaudy production fantasy managers expected on the heels of his breakout 2024 campaign. New England's stout run defense will be tasked with trying to slow down Brown in Week 12.
</div>

### 🟢 Jerry Jeudy (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jeudy failed to build off the momentum from his season-best outing against the Jets in Week 11 (6-78-1), finishing third in receiving yards for the Browns despite leading the team with seven targets. It didn't help the veteran wideout that his starting quarterback was knocked out of the game at halftime, nor did he mesh well with replacement QB Shedeur Sanders, who completed 25 percent of his passes in relief. Cleveland's inconsistent play under center all season has limited Jeudy's production, making the wideout a risky fantasy play on a weekly basis.
</div>

### 🟢 CeeDee Lamb (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Lamb was sidelined for the Cowboys' opening possession for disciplinary reasons per Clarence Hill Jr. of AllDLLS.com, but he rebounded for a solid effort. George Pickens led the team in targets, receptions and yards, though Lamb still managed to make an impact with an 18-yard touchdown early in the first quarter while also logging another long gain of 23 yards. While Pickens may be the preferred option occasionally, Lamb has been very steady by logging at least 65 yards with two scores across four games since he returned from a sprained ankle.
</div>

### 🟢 Dak Prescott (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Prescott and the Dallas offense stalled on the opening drive with both CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens on the sideline for disciplinary reasons. However, the trio picked things up considerably from there, with Prescott completing eight passes of at least 15 yards, including touchdowns of 37 and 18 yards to Pickens and Lamb, respectively. Prescott snapped a two-game streak without multiple touchdowns, and he now has at least three scores in five of his last seven contests.
</div>

### 🟢 RJ Harvey (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> With J.K. Dobbins (foot) done for the rest of the regular season, Harvey stepped into the top spot in the Broncos' backfield for the first time but failed to make much of an impact. Jaleel McLaughlin also vultured a four-yard TD in the third quarter that  might have made Harvey's performance a little more palatable for fantasy investors. The rookie heads into a Week 12 bye with 439 scrimmage yards and six total touchdowns (two on the ground, four through the air) in his first 11 NFL games.
</div>

### 🟢 Luke Musgrave (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> It was presumed that Musgrave would be the Packers tight end who benefitted most from the absence of Tucker Kraft (knee), and he did in Week 10, leading all players at his position in snaps and receiving yardage. However, things took a sharp turn Sunday, as he not only finished second in both departments but third behind both John FitzPatrick and Josh Whyle -- who both, unlike Musgrave, were credited with a Week 11 start. Roles are seemingly fluid in Green Bay's tight end room for the time being, but those counting on Musgrave in fantasy leagues should at the least be evaluating other options.
</div>

### 🟢 Matthew Golden (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Golden's three targets were third on the team behind Romeo Doubs (eight) and Christian Watson (five), but the first-round rookie wideout continues to provide little production in the box score. Through nine games, Golden has just 24 catches for 286 yards and zero touchdowns on 32 targets. He's done nothing to warrant fantasy starter treatment ahead of next Sunday's difficult-on-paper matchup with the Vikings.
</div>

### 🟢 Patrick Mahomes (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Even with Patrick Surtain (pectoral) still sidelined, Mahomes had trouble breaking down the Denver secondary, with his lone TD pass coming in the fourth quarter on a play in which Travis Kelce  did most of the work. The star QB did at least extend his streak of games with 250-plus passing yards to seven, a stretch in which he's posted a 15:5 TD:INT, 66.8 percent completion rate and 7.7 YPA. Mahomes will try to get back on track, and revive Kansas City's suddenly fading playoff hopes, at home in Week 12  against the Colts.
</div>

### 🟢 Xavier Worthy (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Worthy tweaked his ankle at practice Thursday but practiced without limitations Friday, earning the green light for Sunday's showdown between AFC West rivals. Worthy has taken a back seat to Rashee Rice in Kansas City's receiving corps and will be facing a stingy Broncos secondary, but at least the speedster doesn't appear to have any physical limitations.
</div>

### 🟢 Stefon Diggs (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Diggs led the Patriots across the board in receptions, receiving yards and targets on the night, posting his third 100-yard game of a resurgent season in the process. The veteran wideout recorded a pair of catches of 20-plus yards as well, and his reception tally was his second highest of the campaign. Diggs seemed to benefit from the absence of Kayshon Boutte (hamstring) on Thursday, but the former's target volume could take at least a slight hit if the latter is able to return for a favorable Week 12 home matchup against the Bengals.
</div>

### 🟢 TreVeyon Henderson (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The rookie came in with a golden opportunity to follow up his career-best 147-yard rushing day in Week 10 against the Buccaneers, as Rhamondre Stevenson (toe) remained out and Terrell Jennings was dealing with a knee issue. Henderson ended up cashing in, putting together his first three-TD game as a pro via a pair of seven-yard second-quarter scoring runs and a six-yard touchdown grab in the third quarter. He also comfortably paced the Patriots' ground attack with a career-high carry total, and he'll be set up for what should be an elevated Week 12 role -- irrespective of Stevenson's availability -- against a very vulnerable Bengals defense on Sunday, Nov. 23.
</div>

### 🟢 Tyrone Tracy Jr. (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Tracy was given the chance to pace the ground attack in interim head coach Mike Kafka's first game at the helm, and the second-year pro responded with his best all-around performance of the campaign. With Sunday's performance, Tracy eclipsed what was then a season-high 71 rushing yards he'd posted in Week 10 against the Bears, and he also finished with a season high in receiving yards. Given Sunday's results, Tracy figures to remain in the top role during a Week 12 road matchup against the Lions despite the fact backfield mate Devin Singletary was also effective with two rushing touchdowns on 16 carries.
</div>

### 🔴 Brandon Aiyuk (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Out<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Aiyuk will not play in next Monday night's Week 12 game against the Panthers, and he doesn't appear to be particularly close to a return to game action. The 49ers have a Week 14 bye, so perhaps Aiyuk will be able to practice at some point before that and potentially play prior to the end of the regular season. For now, the Niners will continue to roll with Ricky Pearsall, Jauan Jennings and Kendrick Bourne as their three main wideouts.
</div>

### 🟡 Bucky Irving (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>
