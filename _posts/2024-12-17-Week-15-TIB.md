## Player Report

#### Bijan Robinson (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Robinson had clear control of the Falcons' ground game once again, although backfield mate Tyler Allgeier logged 12 carries of his own as part of a run-centric game plan. Robinson eclipsed the 100-yard mark for the fourth time this season in the process, doing so with a figure that qualified as a new season high. The second-year back has now encouragingly logged at least 22 carries in three straight contests, and he could potentially put together an even better performance against the Giants' suspect run defense in a Week 16 home matchup.
#### Darnell Mooney (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** The quick upgrade from limited participation to full confirms Mooney will be ready for Monday's game at Las Vegas. He was one of the few Falcons to thrive Week 14, catching six of seven targets for 142 yards in a 42-21 loss at Minnesota.
#### Dalton Kincaid (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Making his return from a three-game absence due to a knee injury, Kincaid finished third in receptions and receiving yards while sharing the team lead in targets. Kincaid's yardage tally was actually a new season high, and he's posted a trio of four-reception efforts in his last four games dating back to Week 8.
#### Cole Kmet (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Despite the Bears playing from behind all afternoon, Caleb Williams attempted just 23 passes. Chicago simply couldn't move the football versus San Francisco and ran just 52 offensive plays. Kmet was on the field for 92 percent of the offensive downs, and he's played at least 92 percent of the snaps in five consecutive games. That playing time alone keeps him on the fantasy radar ahead of a Week 15 date with the Vikings.
#### Mike Gesicki (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Gesicki finished a distant third on the team in receiving yards behind Ja'Marr Chase (94) and Tee Higgins (88). The veteran tight end has accounted for only two of Joe Burrow's league-leading 36 touchdown passes heading into a Week 16 home game against the Browns, but Gesicki has carved out a passable floor with at least three catches in each of his last three games.
#### Tee Higgins (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Higgins caught a 38-yard touchdown pass in the second quarter to break a 14-14 tie, and the Bengals led the rest of the way. He trailed only Ja'Marr Chase in targets, catches and receiving yards, finishing six yards shy of Chase's team-leading total. Higgins has at least 77 receiving yards in five of his last seven appearances and six touchdowns over that span, so he's been excellent when available. That production included 82 yards and a touchdown in Week 7 against the Browns, whom Higgins will face again Week 16.
#### Amon-Ra St. Brown (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** The Lions were forced into a pass-heavy offense as they chased the Bills all game, and the result was a career-best performance for St. Brown. The highlight came on a 66-yard touchdown catch and run, during which St. Brown split the Buffalo defense down the middle and out-raced several defenders to the end zone. He also chipped in long gains of 24, 31 and 16 yards to top 100 yards for the fourth time this season and for the first time since Week 11.
#### Michael Pittman Jr. (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Pittman fumbled at the end of a six-yard catch in the third quarter, but he led the Colts in targets, catches and receiving yards. Josh Downs had only 32 yards on eight targets after missing one game due to a shoulder injury, and Alec Pierce exited due to a concussion just before halftime. Pittman has at least seven targets in each of the past four games and should maintain a prominent role in the Colts' lackluster passing attack in Week 16 against the Titans.
#### Tank Bigsby (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** After out-touching Travis Etienne, 19-8, in Week 14 against the Titans, Bigsby returned to a complementary role against the Jets, finishing with 11 touches to Etienne's 18. They'll likely continue to work as a tandem in Week 16, when the Jaguars could have a more run-heavy game script than usual in a battle between bottom-feeders against the Raiders. Bigsby has just five catches all season, so he relies almost exclusively on rushing contributions while the versatile Etienne can play in all situations.
#### Quentin Johnston (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** The ankle injury is new for Johnston, so his practice status bears monitoring over the next couple of days ahead of Thursday night's game against the Broncos. Johnston's 73 percent snap share against the Bucs on Sunday was right in line with his norm, so it's unclear when he was injured. He finished with a 5-45-1 line on a season-high 10 targets. If Johnston were to miss Week 16, Joshua Palmer, Jalen Reagor and DJ Chark would be in line to handle outside wide receiver snaps, with rookie Ladd McConkey spending most of his time in the slot.
#### Raheem Mostert (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Mostert made his return from a one-game absence due to a hip injury, and he finished with his third single-digit rushing yardage total in the last four games. Mostert's reception total was a new season high, yet it's clear he's a distant second fiddle, at best, to De'Von Achane in Miami's unproductive ground attack barring an injury to the latter.
#### Devin Singletary (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Singletary tied his highest carry total since Week 4, the last game in which he was still considered the lead back before Tyrone Tracy usurped him for the role. Singletary logged only two fewer carries than his backfield mate Sunday, and his two-yard rushing touchdown late in the first half was his fourth of the campaign. The veteran back should retain a solid complementary role at minimum in a Week 16 road matchup against the vulnerable Falcons defense.
#### Aaron Rodgers (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Rodgers posted his third-highest passing yardage total of the campaign while setting a new season high in rushing yards in this throwback performance. He answered an opening-drive Jaguars touchdown with a 22-yard touchdown pass to Garrett Wilson, but the veteran quarterback finished the first half with just three completions and 55 passing yards. Rodgers bounced back in the third quarter with a go-ahead one-yard touchdown pass to Davante Adams, whom Rodgers connected with for a 43-yard gain earlier on the drive. After the Jets fell behind 22-17 in the fourth quarter, Rodgers found Adams for a 71-yard touchdown and a two-point conversion to take a three-point lead with 3:24 remaining, then linked up with Adams for a 41-yard gain to set up Breece Hall's game-winning touchdown run. Adams accounted for 198 of Rodgers' 289 passing yards, and their chemistry will be tough for the Rams to stop in Week 16.
#### Russell Wilson (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** The Eagles dominated time of possession, and the Steelers ran only offensive 41 plays. That was due in part to Wilson's inability to move the Pittsburgh offense, as the unit totaled -19 yards through their five possessions while picking up only 163 net yards for the game. The end result was Wilson's lowest yardage total as the team's starter and his second consecutive performance with less than 160 passing yards with George Pickens (hamstring) sidelined. Though Baltimore's passing defense, which Pittsburgh's offense will face next Saturday, has been leaky at times, it will be difficult to trust Wilson moving forward -- particularly as long as Pickens is out.
#### Kenneth Walker III (RB)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Walker has missed back-to-back contests due to a calf injury, and he also hasn't practiced since Wednesday, Dec. 4. Macdonald added, "We'll see," regarding Walker's chances to take the field Wednesday, when the Seahawks are slated for their first session of Week 16 prep. Zach Charbonnet has filled in for Walker during his absence, turning 38 touches into 259 yards from scrimmage and three rushing TDs, and even Kenny McIntosh has got some run (12 touches for 54 total yards).
#### Tyler Lockett (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Since the Seahawks' Week 10 bye, Lockett has averaged just 15.4 receiving yards per game while failing to find the end zone. Meanwhile, second-year wideout Jaxon Smith-Njigba has been a target hog, tallying a team-high 12 targets in Week 15. It will be tough to depend on Lockett for fantasy purposes moving forward.
#### Mike Evans (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Evans showed no ill effects from the hamstring injury that limited him during the practice week, ripping off two long touchdown receptions in Sunday's lopsided victory. The nine receptions and 159 yards both marked new highs for the superstar wideout in 2024. Evans likely helped many fantasy managers advance in their respective playoff schedule, and he could be in for an encore against a middling Cowboys squad on Sunday Night Football in Week 16.
