## Player Report

#### Bryce Young (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Young was looking like he was headed toward another dreadful performance in a one-sided loss when the Panthers went into the break down 20-3. The young signal-caller flipped the script in the second half, firing off three touchdown passes on consecutive drives to make this a nail-biter. While his team still fell short in the end, Young reignited hope in fantasy managers with his stellar play to close out this contest. The top overall pick in the 2023 draft will be looking to ride the momentum from this outing into next Sunday's tilt against the Falcons.
#### Chase Brown (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Brown was the only Bengals running back to record a carry for the second straight game to begin the season. However, he was also extremely inefficient once again, averaging only 2.9 yards per attempt with a long of just 11 yards. This performance was a bit more justifiable, as Jake Browning entered the game halfway through the second quarter after Joe Burrow (toe) was sidelined, allowing the Jaguars to focus on short areas of the field defensively. The Bengals don't have strong alternatives to Brown for carries, but he now has only 90 rushing yards on 37 attempts across the first two games of the campaign.
#### Harold Fannin Jr. (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** The rookie H-back/tight end tied for the team lead in receptions while finishing a close second to Jerry Jeudy in receiving yards. It was a second consecutive encouraging effort for Fannin to open his NFL career, and his usage through two games, which includes 14 targets and one rush attempt, makes it clear he's already established a solid niche in head coach Kevin Stefanski's offense going into a Week 3 home matchup against the Packers next Sunday afternoon.
#### Jerry Jeudy (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Jeudy's receiving yardage total led the Browns on a day when Joe Flacco threw for just 199 yards, and when he and Dillon Gabriel spread the ball around to nine different pass catchers. There was talk of a second consecutive breakout campaign for Jeudy heading into 2025, and through two games, he has a 9-117-0 line on 16 targets as a Week 3 home date with the Packers approaches next Sunday.
#### Dak Prescott (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** It was Prescott's highest yardage total since Week 3 of last season, when he fired up 379 yards in a loss to the Ravens. The veteran QB rebounded in a big way from a quiet Week 1 effort, but the Cowboys' defensive issues may require him to continue putting the ball in the air a lot more often than expected. Prescott could be poised for another big performance in Week 3 against a Bears defense that just got torched for five passing TDs by Jared Goff and the Lions.
#### CeeDee Lamb (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** While his final numbers were overshadowed by Malik Nabers' 9-167-2 line, Lamb came up big for the Cowboys when he needed to and led his team in receiving yards while tying Jake Ferguson for the team lead in catches. Lamb has begun the season with back-to-back 100-yard performances, but he's still looking for his first TD heading into a Week 3 clash with a Bears defense that just got torched by Amon-Ra St. Brown and the Lions.
#### Brenton Strange (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Strange again operated as Jacksonville's clear No. 1 tight end, playing 90 percent of offensive snaps, but it was wideouts Dyami Brown (5-57-1) and Parker Washington (5-76-0) who stepped up in the receiving game with both Brian Thomas and Travis Hunter held in check for a second straight week. Strange has drawn nine targets through two weeks, enough volume to put him on the radar as a back-end TE1 for fantasy purposes heading into a Week 3 matchup against the Texans.
#### Xavier Worthy (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** questionable
#### Patrick Mahomes (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Mahomes and the Chiefs dropped to 0-2 on the year after suffering a loss at the hands of the team that embarrassed them in Super Bowl LIX last season. The final score was much closer this time around, but Philadelphia's defense held the superstar QB in check statistically. Mahomes continues to spread the ball around with top wideouts Rashee Rice (suspension) and Xavier Worthy (shoulder) out of action, dialing up nine different targets Sunday after completing passes to seven different receivers in last week's loss. Mahomes is going to continue to have to do the heavy lifting for Kansas City's offense ahead of a Week 3 matchup against the New York Giants on Sunday Night Football.
#### Kayshon Boutte (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Boutte unsurprisingly saw a significant reduction in volume after setting a new career high with eight targets Week 1, but he made the most of his only Week 2 look, pulling in his fourth touchdown in 22 NFL games. The 23-year-old wide receiver is hanging onto a starting role on the outside, but New England likes to spread the ball around, as Drake Maye's 19 completions were split between nine different pass catchers. Up next for Boutte is a Week 3 home game against the Steelers.
#### Stefon Diggs (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Diggs tied Rhamondre Stevenson for the team lead in targets but finished third on the Patriots in receiving yards behind Stevenson (88) and Austin Hooper (38). Drake Maye spread the ball out to nine different receivers, and New England's pair of touchdowns through the air went to Mack Hollins and Kayshon Boutte. Diggs is the top option in New England's wide receiver room, but that role doesn't always command significant volume in a Patriots offense predicated on runs and quick passes. Diggs could see a lot of star cornerback Jalen Ramsey in Week 3 against the Steelers, which will make it difficult for the veteran wide receiver to pick up the pace.
#### Cam Skattebo (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The 2025 fourth-round pick made a big statement in his second NFL game, producing a TD nearly single-handedly in the fourth quarter with a 24-yard run to the one-yard line before punching home his first career score. Skattebo provides a punishing, physical presence in the Giants' backfield that Tyrone Tracy and Devin Singletary lack, and while Tracy should continue to be the team's primary option on passing downs, the rookie made a strong case Sunday to be New York's first choice on running downs. Skattebo will look to build on this performance in Week 3 against Kansas City.
#### Tyrone Tracy Jr. (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** The second-year back tied for third on the Giants in targets with tight end Theo Johnson, but Tracy saw 2025 fourth-round pick Cam Skattebo emerge as a serious threat to his early-down workload with 45 rushing yards and a TD on 11 totes. Given that the 0-2 Giants could be playing from behind a lot this season, primarily being used on passing downs should still lead to a significant role for Tracy, but Skattebo's performance still doesn't bode well for his backfield mate's fantasy value. The split in touches between the two should become a little clearer in Week 3 against Kansas City.
#### Braelon Allen (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Allen had just two touches to Breece Hall's 12, suggesting the former remains a distant second on the Jets' depth chart. The entire offense struggled in this one and actually picked up the pace down the stretch after Justin Fields (concussion) exited in the fourth quarter. Allen's outlook is unlikely to change if Fields misses additional action, in which case Tyrod Taylor would start under center.
#### Chris Godwin Jr. (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** questionable
#### Bucky Irving (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Backfield mate Rachaad White actually took the first touch of the night for the Buccaneers, but Irving went on to gain 16 yards on his first two carries later in the opening possession. The Texans were able to clamp down on Irving more consistently as the game unfolded, but the versatile second-year back helped make up for some inefficiency with his work as a receiver. Irving particularly came up big on Tampa Bay's game-winning drive, recording four of his catches for a total of 39 yards. White would go on to punch in the game-winning score, but Irving still outpaced him by seven carries and four targets. The duo should continue in a timeshare that clearly tilts in Irving's favor during a Week 3 home matchup against the Jets on Sunday afternoon.
