## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Emari Demercado (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Out<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> out
</div>

### 🟢 Michael Penix Jr. (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Injured Reserve<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Penix faces a nine-month recovery timetable as a result of the procedure. The 25-year-old quarterback has now undergone ACL reconstructive surgeries three times in his career, as he previously had procedures on his right knee in 2018 and 2020 while in college. He also suffered season-ending injuries to each shoulder in 2019 and 2021. Morris has said that the severe nature of Penix's injury will "100 percent" influence Atlanta to "make some different plans" at quarterback this offseason, per Adam Schefter of ESPN, though that could just as easily refer to the team prioritizing a reliable backup rather than bringing in actual competition for the starting role. Kirk Cousins will start the remainder of the season under center for the Falcons, but this offseason the team can exercise a potential 'out' for the final two season of his four-year, $180 million contract at the cost of a $35 million dead-cap hit. Atlanta doesn't currently hold any first-round picks in the 2026 NFL Draft, which will limit the team's ability to maneuver in pursuit of a high-upside alternative at quarterback.
</div>

### 🟢 Rome Odunze (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Odunze tied Luther Burden and Colston Loveland for the most targets on the Bears on Friday, but Odunze was unable to do much with his limited touches on a day in which Caleb Williams completed just 17 of 36 passes (47.2 percent). Odunze has cooled off from his hot start to the regular season, when he logged a 20-296-5 line on 35 targets through the first four games. In the eight games since Chicago's Week 5 bye, the second-year wideout has caught just 24 passes (on 55 targets) for 365 yards and a score. Odunze will look to get on track Week 14 during the Bears' NFC North clash against the Packers on Sunday, Dec. 7.
</div>

### 🟢 Caleb Williams (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> As his numbers indicate, Williams put together a forgettable fantasy effort that saw him average just 4.3 yards per attempt and finish with a QB rating of 56.9. The 2024 first overall pick leaned heavily on a ground attack that repeatedly knifed through the Eagles defense and a gritty performance from his own team's unit against Philadelphia's offense. Williams connected with Cole Kmet for his one touchdown pass from 28 yards out with just over six minutes remaining in the contest, and his late third-quarter pick was nullified by a Jalen Hurts fumble on a Tush Push attempt four plays later. Williams did see a four-game interception-less streak snapped with the miscue and has thrown for under 200 yards in two of the last three games, but at 9-3, the Bears head into a critical road clash with the Packers on Sunday, Dec. 7 with plenty of momentum.
</div>

### 🟢 D'Andre Swift (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> It was a banner day for the Bears' ground attack, as both Swift and Kyle Monangai comfortably exceeded 100 yards. Each back also punched in a score, with Swift's coming from three yards out late in the first quarter and serving as his first trip to the end zone on the ground since Week 8. Swift's rushing yardage total was also a new season high, making it a highly rewarding day against one of his previous squads. Swift saw four fewer carries than his rookie backfield mate Friday, however, but the division of labor could fluctuate week to week down the stretch depending on a number of factors, including who proves to have the hot hand in any given contest.
</div>

### 🔴 Jayden Reed (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Injured Reserve<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Reed hasn't played since Week 2 due to foot and collarbone injuries, but his 21-day practice window was opened 10 days ago. He should be considered genuinely questionable for Sunday's game against the Bears. If Reed remains sidelined, the Packers will likely continue to lean on Christian Watson, Romeo Doubs and Dontayvion Wicks as their main three-wide set.
</div>

### 🟢 Travis Kelce (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The future Hall of Famer hit pay dirt for the fifth time this season, and the 84th time in his career, on a two-yard toss from Patrick Mahomes in the first quarter. Kelce has caught at least four passes in five straight games, compiling a 28-344-3 line on 38 targets over that stretch, but he may have a hard time keeping that momentum going Week 14 against the Texans.
</div>

### 🟢 Hunter Henry (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Henry co-led the Patriots in receptions while setting the pace in receiving yards and targets on the night. The veteran tight end also tied with running back Rhamondre Stevenson for the longest reception of the night (36 yards), and Henry now has 187 receiving yards and a touchdown on 11 catches over the last two games. Henry has flashed excellent chemistry with Drake Maye throughout the season, and the duo should remain busy in a Week 15 home showdown against the Bills on Sunday, Dec. 14 following a Week 14 bye.
</div>

### 🟢 Chris Olave (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Olave suited up after dealing with back spasms that left him questionable to play Week 13. The wideout finished third on the Saints in targets, as Devaughn Vele logged eight targets while tight end Juwan Johnson led the team with nine. Olave still scored his second touchdown in the last three games, connecting with rookie QB Tyler Shough for the second time since he became the Saints' starter Week 9. Despite the Saints' quarterback struggles, Olave's consistency and WR1 usage make him a no-brainer starting option for fantasy purposes. The Saints next face the Buccaneers in Week 14.
</div>

### 🟢 Will Shipley (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Clemson product received his first offensive touch since the Eagles' Week 10 win over the Packers and played ahead of Tank Bigsby (no touches on just one offensive snap) during Friday's loss, suggesting he may be emerging as the team's No. 2 running back. Shipley has now appeared in 10 games this season, recording 84 total yards on 16 touches while also accumulating 520 kick-return yards. He's likely to remain a minor factor in Philadelphia's offense in the Week 14 matchup against the Chargers.
</div>

### 🟢 DeVonta Smith (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Smith has operated as the Eagles' top pass catcher for most of the season, but A.J. Brown significantly overshadowed him in Friday's loss. Smith's production came primarily on two catches of 30 and 12 yards, the former of which was Philadelphia's second-longest play from scrimmage. Smith has at least seven targets in five of his last six games, though he's been held under 50 receiving yards in two of his last three contests.
</div>

### 🟢 Jalen Hurts (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Hurts failed to move the Eagles offense in the first half, as he was regularly off target and totaled only 57 passing yards on 10 attempts. He was more effective in the second half, connecting with A.J. Brown on several key completions -- including 33 and four-yard touchdown strikes. Even Hurts' effort in the final two quarters was hampered by two turnovers, however, including a fumble on a Tush Push deep in Bears territory. While he has been inconsistent leading the Philadelphia offense, Hurts has multiple touchdowns in consecutive games and four of his last six contests.
</div>

### 🟢 DK Metcalf (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Metcalf continues to lead the Steelers in targets, but that wasn't particularly meaningful in Sunday's loss, given that the team attempted only 24 passes. His longest gain of the day was a 14-yard catch early in the second quarter to help set up the team's only touchdown of the game, and he's now gone five consecutive matchups without a reception of at least 20 yards. In that same span, Metcalf's highest yardage total in a game is 49 yards.
</div>

### 🟢 Christian McCaffrey (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The 21 receiving yards represented his lowest total of the season, while the 74 scrimmage yards were his worst production since Week 8 as the 49ers offense struggled in bad weather against a tough Cleveland front seven. McCaffrey salvaged his day with a one-yard TD plunge to open the scoring in the first quarter however, his eighth rushing score and 13th total touchdown in 13 games. McCaffrey will get a breather during next week's bye before taking on a more vulnerable Titans defense in Week 15.
</div>

### 🟢 Rachaad White (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> White saw his workload on the ground diminish significantly with the return of Bucky Irving from a seven-game absence due to foot and shoulder injuries. With Irving now back in the fold and seemingly ready to handle a full workload, White and Sean Tucker, who also logged two carries Sunday, appear set to compete for leftover touches moving forward, capping the fantasy upside of both backs.
</div>

### 🟢 Elic Ayomanor (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Ayomanor returned from a one-game absence caused by a hamstring injury and immediately occupied a key role in the offense as one of four pass catchers with at least five targets. His only catch came early in the second quarter, and he has only three receptions for 16 yards on 11 targets in his last two contests.
