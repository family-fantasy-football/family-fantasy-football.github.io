## 🏥 Player Report

### 🔴 Kyler Murray (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Injured Reserve<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Murray remains on injured reserve but is eligible to have his 21-day practice window opened. However, the Cardinals will not start Murray's clock for a return, and he'll stick on injured reserve for at least one more week while his foot continues to heal. Jacoby Brissett again will operate under center as the Cardinals' starting quarterback.
</div>

### 🟢 Darnell Mooney (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Mooney led all Falcons wide receivers in targets but finished third on the team in that category behind Kyle Pitts (eight) and Bijan Robinson (seven) as Atlanta played without top wide receiver Drake London (knee) for a second consecutive game. Mooney had 74 yards and a touchdown in the first game London missed, but that performance was fueled by a 49-yard touchdown catch. If London remains sidelined in Week 14, Mooney would likely remain the de facto top wide receiver for the Falcons against Seattle's talented secondary.
</div>

### 🟢 Kyle Pitts Sr. (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Pitts led the Falcons in targets, catches and receiving yards Sunday as they played without Drake London (knee) for a second consecutive game. If London remains sidelined in Week 14, a few more targets could flow Pitts' way against a Seahawks defense that has struggled to defend tight ends. The 6-foot-6 tight end  has secured multiple receptions in every game this season but has only one touchdown.
</div>

### 🟢 Mark Andrews (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Andrews had a mostly quiet night until the latter portion of the contest, when he recorded catches of 19, eight and 14 yards from the late third quarter on. The veteran tight end finished with one fewer reception and 48 fewer receiving yards than position mate Isaiah Likely on the same number of targets, and Andrews will take a 37-332-5 line on 52 targets into a Week 14 home matchup against the Steelers on Sunday, Dec. 7.
</div>

### 🟢 Keon Coleman (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> After being a healthy scratch in Buffalo's last two contests due to disciplinary reasons, Coleman made a triumphant return to the lineup by catching the only touchdown pass for either side in Sunday's win. It was a low-volume passing day overall, with no Bills' player recording more than three receptions or 33 yards. Coleman's three targets finished in a tie for fourth among his teammates, making it tough to gauge the wideout's role moving forward. Now that he is out of head coach Sean McDermott's doghouse, Coleman can at least be viewed as a deep-league option in Week 14 against the Bengals.
</div>

### 🟢 Tetairoa McMillan (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> While the rookie wideout was held in check for three quarters, McMillan finally got free on a fourth-down play in the fourth and hauled in a touchdown from Bryce Young for the go-ahead score. McMillan has gotten into the end zone in three straight games, producing an 11-208-4 line on 21 targets as he establishes himself as Young's go-to option in clutch situations. McMillan will get some rest during next week's bye before taking aim at the Saints in Week 15.
</div>

### 🟢 Javonte Williams (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Malik Davis scored Dallas' only TD on the ground on an impressive 43-yard run in the second quarter, but Williams snagged the team's final touchdown of the afternoon, catching a three-yard toss from Dak Prescott early in the fourth that put the Cowboys in the lead for good. It was Williams' first trip to the end zone since Week 8, and through 12 games on the season he's amassed 955 rushing yards and eight scores on the ground while adding a 31-128-2 line on 42 targets. He'll look to record his first career 1,000-yard rushing campaign as a pro Week 14 against the Lions.
</div>

### 🟢 Nick Chubb (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Chubb once again played a clear second fiddle to Woody Marks (19 carries, one target), but the veteran was able to punch in his third rushing touchdown of the season on a four-yard run with just over five minutes remaining in the second quarter. Marks left the game briefly in the first half due to a foot injury but returned, and Chubb therefore projects to remain in a firm complementary role during a Week 14 road battle against the Chiefs next Sunday night.
</div>

### 🟢 Davis Mills (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Coach Demeco Ryans made the announcement at the end of Week 13 prep, meaning Mills' time as the Texans' starting quarterback has come to a close for now. In three games spelling Stroud, Mills completed 69 of 116 passes for 719 yards, five touchdowns and one interception and had seven carries for 38 yards and one TD.
</div>

### 🟢 Quentin Johnston (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Johnston's touchdown came late in the first quarter on a niftily designed short target that required the 2023 first-round pick to nimbly dart around for 10 yards and into the end zone. Week 14 presents an obvious challenge against a gamey Philadelphia defense, and it could become more difficult with the left (non-throwing) hand fracture to quarterback Justin Herbert, which will require surgery. Herbert played through the injury throughout the second half and largely seemed unaffected aside from some cumbersome padding around the injured area, and both the quarterback and head coach Jim Harbaugh think it's possible Herbert will play next week. Still, Johnston has been incredibly volatile in terms of targets in recent weeks, and that probably won't change with a dinged up Herbert and his uncertain status.
</div>

### 🟢 Malik Washington (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Washington's five targets were one fewer than Jaylen Waddle's six for the team lead on a day when Tua Tagovailoa dropped back to pass 27 times. Washington has operated as the Dolphins' WR2 by default since Tyreek Hill suffered a season-ending knee injury in Week 4, but Washington has shown a low ceiling, as he's failed to reach 50 receiving yards in any of his 12 appearances this season. He carries minimal fantasy appeal headed into a Week 14 date with the Jets.
</div>

### 🟢 Justin Jefferson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Vikings were forced to turn to undrafted rookie Max Brosmer with starter J.J. McCarthy (concussion) unavailable and backup Carson Wentz (shoulder) on injured reserve. The end result was even worse than expected with the third-stringer under center after Jefferson finished the shutout loss with a career-low four receiving yards. The horrid quarterback situation in Minnesota has damaged its star wideout's fantasy value in addition to its playoff hopes. The remaining hope for Jefferson's fantasy managers is that McCarthy can clear the league's concussion protocol by next Sunday's matchup against the Commanders, as he at least possesses the arm strength to take shots down the field towards his superstar receiver.
</div>

### 🟢 Theo Johnson (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Johnson matched his previous single-game high in targets (eight) set back in Week 10 against the Bears, but the large volume didn't translate into proportional production this time around. The 24-year-old was New Work's fourth-leading receiver despite tying Wan'Dale Robinson for the most looks from Jaxson Dart on Monday Night Football. Johnson has still been a pleasant surprise in fantasy this season after generating a 42-456-5 receiving line across 13 games while catching passes from three different quarterbacks. The Penn State product has carved out a significant role on offense and should maintain steady value when the Giants return from the upcoming bye week to host the Commanders in Week 15.
</div>

### 🟢 Aaron Rodgers (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Rodgers suffered the injury in the Steelers' Week 11 win over the Bengals and was forced to miss his first game of the season in last Sunday's loss to the Bears, though he appeared to make a strong bid to be available for that contest. Mason Rudolph ultimately drew the start against Chicago, but he'll be returning to a backup role Sunday after Rodgers was able to show enough improvement over the course of Week 13 prep to gain clearance to play. Rodgers is still likely to don some sort of protective brace on his non-throwing wrist Sunday to guard against further injury.
</div>

### 🟢 Chris Godwin Jr. (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Godwin led the Buccaneers in receiving yards with a total that also served as a season high. The veteran wideout had a much more subdued performance in his Week 12 return from a five-game absence due to a fibula injury, but an increase in snaps and the ability of Baker Mayfield to play a full game helped Godwin's cause Sunday. Godwin, who also dropped a very catchable would-be touchdown pass from Baker Mayfield, should be in line for even more opportunity during a Week 14 home matchup against the Saints next Sunday.
