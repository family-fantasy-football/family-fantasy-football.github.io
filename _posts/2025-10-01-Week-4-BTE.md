## Player Report

#### Dalton Kincaid (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Kincaid made his one catch count by streaking down the right sideline for a touchdown midway through the fourth quarter. The reception and receiving yardage totals were both low-water marks for the tight end over the first four weeks, but with three touchdowns already on his 2025 ledger, he's still rewarded fantasy managers despite the relative week-to-week uncertainty inherent in the Bills' air attack. Kincaid next sets his sights on the Patriots' defense, which he'll face in a Week 5 home matchup next Sunday night.
#### DJ Moore (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The 28-year-old took a back seat to Rome Odunze (4-69-1) yet again, as a changing of the guard appears to have taken place in Chicago's receiver room. Moore still possesses a consistent role in new head coach Ben Johnson's offense, garnering five to six targets on a weekly basis, but expectations need to be tempered even if QB Caleb Williams takes a big step forward coming out of Chicago's upcoming Week 5 bye.
#### Tee Higgins (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Higgins led the Bengals in receiving yards, but considering Jake Browning threw for just 125 yards, it was still a very quiet night for the talented receiver. Higgins has put together an underwhelming first four games overall, as he has a 10-136-1 line on 20 targets in his first four games, including a three-catch, 33-yard effort against the Browns in Week 1, the one full game he played with Joe Burrow (IR, toe). With Browning averaging just 5.1 yards per attempt in his first two starts and Brett Rypien the only other healthy option on the QB depth chart, Higgins' fantasy outlook remains depressed heading into a Week 5 home matchup against the Lions.
#### Jake Browning (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** About the only true positive for Browning in the lopsided loss was that he managed to avoid turning the ball over against a ferocious Broncos defense. Browning took three sacks and averaged only 5.0 yards per attempt, with no Bengals pass catcher managing to exceed 32 receiving yards. Browning has completed just 63.4 percent of his passes and posted a 1:2 TD:INT over his first two full games as a starter, so it remains to be seen if head coach Zac Taylor considers a change to fellow backup Brett Rypien for a Week 5 home matchup against the Lions.
#### Jerome Ford (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Ford was on the field for a season-low 18 snaps, as Cleveland's backfield is now topped by Quinshon Judkins, who had 21 of the 23 carries allotted to running backs. Ford still contributes as a third-down back and has been targeted multiple times in three consecutive contests, and he appears to still be slightly ahead of Dylan Sampson in the pecking order for touches.
#### C.J. Stroud (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Warren gets into the weeds, outlining the pre-snap reads, adjustments and execution of the play, but the main point is that Stroud may have found his groove in the new offense. That offense, put in place by new offensive coordinator Nick Caley, involves Stroud taking more control. It may have taken three-and-a-half games to click in, as the quarterback completed 11 of 13 attempts (eight different targets) for 144 yards while directing touchdown drives on successive possessions from late in the third quarter and into the fourth. Following an ugly 0-3 start and head coach DeMeco Ryans' defense of Caley, Stroud's intuition and execution of the offense may extend forward to Week 5 on the road against the Ravens.
#### Christian Kirk (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Kirk was active for a second game after missing the first two weeks of the year with a hamstring injury. He's totaled 12 targets, more than any Houston receiver who has appeared in all four games aside from Nico Collins (31). Kirk will remain the No. 2 wideout for now, but rookie Jayden Higgins, who caught his first NFL touchdown Sunday, could push for the role as the season progresses.
#### J.J. McCarthy (QB)
**Injury Status:** Doubtful <br>
**Lineup Slot:** IR <br>
**Details:** doubtful
#### DeMario Douglas (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** In the process, the slot receiver didn't record a target, with Reiss noting that Douglas' dip in playing time corresponded with Stefon Diggs' snap share increasing Sunday. Though there will be weeks where Douglas is more involved in the offense, be it via game plan or game flow, his 5-13-1 line on 13 targets through four games has him off the fantasy lineup radar for now.
#### Juwan Johnson (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Johnson logged fewer than eight targets for the first time this season, finishing fifth on the team in this category behind wideouts Chris Olave (six), Rashid Shaheed (five) and Brandin Cooks (four) as well as running back Alvin Kamara (five). The Saints also logged more rushing attempts (34) than passing attempts (28) for the first time in 2025, as for the first time this season the team didn't have to chase points while keeping the game within one score until midway through the fourth quarter. Johnson has been one of the top PPR tight ends this season, averaging 5.5 catches on 8.0 targets per game. He'll look to get back on track during a Week 5 matchup versus the Giants on Sunday, Oct. 5.
#### Breece Hall (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Hall bounced back from a pair of ugly outings by cracking the century mark in total yards for the second time this season. Braelon Allen (4-26-0) was nearly splitting work with the starter before exiting the game in the first half after taking a shot to his knee. The injury forced offensive coordinator Tanner Engstrand to give Hall -- the Jets' obvious top rushing option -- enough touches to actually generate positive fantasy results. The 24-year-old has yet to hit pay dirt through four starts, a trend Hall will aim to buck in a tasty matchup on paper against the Cowboys on Sunday.
#### Dallas Goedert (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Goedert tied for the team lead in receptions with Saquon Barkley while setting the pace in receiving yards, and he was also on the receiving end of both of Jalen Hurts' scoring tosses. Each of the touchdown grabs was unconventional, with Goedert first crossing the goal line on a nifty two-yard underhand pass from Hurts in the first quarter and then finding paydirt again on a second-quarter shovel pass from five yards out. Goedert is on a bit of a scoring surge with three total touchdown catches in the last two games, and he could be busy again in Week 5 at home against a Broncos team that could force Hurts to get the ball out quickly.
#### Zach Charbonnet (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Making his return from a one-game absence due to a foot injury, Charbonnet missed an opportunity for a two-touchdown night when his seven-yard scoring run early in the fourth quarter was nullified by a Jaxon Smith-Njigba holding call. Charbonnet had found the end zone for the second time this season on a one-yard run late in the first half, but after logging more snaps than backfield Kenneth Walker in each of the first two games of the season, the latter recorded six more carries Thursday night. Consequently, Charbonnet may continue working in more of a complementary role during a Week 5 home matchup against the Buccaneers on Sunday, Oct. 5.
#### Kenneth Walker III (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** The Seahawks welcomed back Zach Charbonnet from a one-game absence due to a foot injury Thursday, but Walker still saw seven more carries than his teammate while equaling his target tally. Walker had a long run of just 21 yards, so he worked hard for his yardage throughout the night and also turned in a chunk gain on his one catch. Walker now has alternated two duds on the ground with a pair of above-average yardage totals, and he's added at least one reception in each game as well. Thursday night's usage seems to indicate Walker might be considered the lead back over Charbonnet heading into a Week 5 home matchup against the Buccaneers on Sunday, Oct. 5.
#### Terry McLaurin (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** McLaurin sat out Week 4 and has yet to practice in any capacity since a quad injury forced him off the field early Week 3 versus the Raiders, but it sounds like the veteran wideout has a fair chance to return to action Week 5 against the Chargers. Quarterback Jayden Daniels (knee), meanwhile, seems a likely candidate to retake the field Sunday on the road against the Chargers. It will bode well for McLaurin if he's able to be listed as at least a limited participant on Wednesday's first official practice report of the week.
