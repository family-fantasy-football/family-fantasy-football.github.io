## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟡 Kyler Murray (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jacoby Brissett was once again impressive Monday while filling in for Murray under center, leading Arizona to a primetime win while throwing for multiple scores for the third contest in a row. Brissett's performance has seemingly created a quarterback controversy in Arizona, though Gannon tried to end that chatter with a clear statement that Murray remains atop the depth chart. Murray has yet to record a full practice since suffering a mid-foot sprain, so it remains unclear if he'll be ready to return Week 10 against Seattle.
</div>

### 🟢 Darnell Mooney (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Mooney played every offensive snap for the first time this season, but he finished with only one catch for a third time in six appearances. The wideout caught three passes for a season-high 68 yards during his Week 7 return from a one-game absence due to a shoulder injury, but he totaled only two receptions on six targets for 26 yards over his past two appearances. Only three Falcons saw more than two targets Sunday: Drake London (14), Bijan Robinson (10) and Kyle Pitts (seven).
</div>

### 🟢 Kyle Pitts Sr. (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Drake London and Bijan Robinson combined for 17 catches, 168 receiving yards and three London receiving touchdowns, but Pitts was the best of the rest, as Darnell Mooney contributed Atlanta's only reception by a player other than London, Robinson or Pitts. After catching all nine of his targets from Kirk Cousins in the Week 8 loss to the Dolphins, Pitts was back to working with Michael Penix, who returned from a one-game absence due to a knee injury. Pitts has at least three receptions in every game this season heading into a Week 10 meeting with the Colts in Berlin.
</div>

### 🟢 Mark Andrews (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Andrews commemorated the return of Lamar Jackson from a three-game absence by catching his long-time quarterback's first two scoring tosses of the night, with those coming from three and 20 yards out in the first half. The veteran tight end's pair of scores were his first since the game in which he scored his other two touchdowns of the season, back in Week 3 against the Lions. That high-scoring loss also marked the only time Andrews has exceeded 34 receiving yards this season, so he'll look to boost his overall non-TD production against the Vikings in a Week 10 road matchup on Sunday, Nov. 9.
</div>

### 🟢 Keon Coleman (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The second-year wideout from Florida State has struggled over his last three games, catching eight of 12 targets for just 58 yards despite leading the Bills' wide-receiver room in snaps played (138 snaps) during that span. Even so, Coleman has had a solid season overall, recording 284 yards and two touchdowns on 29 catches. He's likely to remain the Bills' No. 1 wideout and will look to get back on track heading into the Week 10 matchup against the Dolphins.
</div>

### 🟢 Tetairoa McMillan (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The rookie wideout was Bryce Young's first read once again, leading the Panthers in catches, targets and receiving yards, although that role didn't amount to much production as the team leaned heavily on Rico Dowdle to generate points. McMillan has caught at least three passes in every game so far, delivering a 41-558-2 line on 69 targets through nine contests. He could be a little busier in Week 10 against the Saints.
</div>

### 🟢 Javonte Williams (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Williams ceded just a single rushing opportunity to another running back (Malik Davis) and once again churned out an efficient performance, averaging over 5.0 yards per carry for the fifth time this season. Williams recorded three runs of 10-plus yards along the way, but his fumble at the Cardinals' 37-yard line with just under five minutes remaining and Dallas trying to reduce a 10-point deficit proved costly. The miscue aside, Williams has enjoyed a resurgent first half of his debut Cowboys campaign, and he'll continue in his unquestioned lead-back role in a Week 11 road matchup against the Raiders on Monday night, Nov. 17 following a Week 10 bye.
</div>

### 🟢 Josh Jacobs (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The former Raider continues to thrive as a Packer. Jacobs' one-yard TD run in the fourth quarter tied the contest at 13-13 and extended his personal scoring streak to five games, a stretch in which he's amassed 354 rushing yards and eight TDs. Sunday's loss also marked his third game this season with 100-plus scrimmage yards. Jacobs will likely be leaned on heavily once again in a Week 10 battle against the Eagles, especially with the Packers having seen Tucker Kraft (knee) and Matthew Golden (shoulder) go down to injuries against the Panthers.
</div>

### 🟢 Nick Chubb (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The veteran split the backfield workload with rookie Woody Marks, and while Chubb led the Texans in rushing, it was still a tepid showing. The former Brown has yet to top 61 rushing yards in a game this season, and while he's gotten double-digit carries in six of eight contests, there have been very few flashes of his pre-injury form. Houston could lean more heavily on its ground game in Week 10 against the Jaguars, however, if C.J. Stroud (concussion) remains sidelined and Davis Mills is under center.
</div>

### 🟢 Quentin Johnston (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Johnston bounced back from a zero-target performance in Week 8, thanks primarily to 23- and 19-yard receptions -- the latter of which went for a touchdown. Most importantly, he seemed to regain his role in the Chargers' offense, matching Keenan Allen and Oronde Gadsden in targets. Overall, Johnston logged his highest yardage total since Week 4 and is likely to remain a volatile fantasy performer, though he has a touchdown in five of eight games this season
</div>

### 🟢 Malik Washington (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Washington once again played a solid complementary role in the Dolphins' Tyreek Hill-less air attack, while also continuing to moonlight as an occasional rusher and primary punt returner. It was in the former capacity that Washington committed a key turnover Thursday, as he fumbled on the Ravens' 11-yard line early in the fourth quarter on his third and final carry of the night. The second-year wideout has between three and five catches in five consecutive games, and he should continue to handle multiple roles in a Week 10 home divisional clash against the Bills on Sunday, Nov. 9.
</div>

### 🟢 Justin Jefferson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Working with J.J. McCarthy as his quarterback for the first time since Week 2, Jefferson finished with team-high reception and target totals while coming just a yard short of drawing even with Jordan Addison for the lead in receiving yards as well. Jefferson's yardage tally was his lowest since Week 1, but his 10-yard touchdown grab to cap off the Vikings' first drive of the contest was also his first trip to the end zone since the opening game of the campaign. Jefferson and McCarthy will continue to build chemistry as the second half of the season unfolds, with their next opportunity coming in a Week 10 home matchup against the Ravens.
</div>

### 🟢 Theo Johnson (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Johnson capped the opening drive with his fifth touchdown in the past six games, scoring from 15 yards out. His five other targets resulted in only 12 yards. Given the plethora of injuries to skill-position players for the Giants, Johnson will likely continue to work as one of the team's top contributors in the passing game against the Bears in Week 10.
</div>

### 🟢 Justin Fields (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Glenn praised Fields' performance during Sunday's 39-38 win over the Bengals, saying he "managed the game really well," while also noting that "there are still some things within that game that [Fields] knows he has to improve on." Still, Glenn did not reveal whether Fields or Tyrod Taylor will start under center at home against the Browns on Sunday, Nov. 9. Taylor seemed to be trending toward the start versus Cincinnati prior to being ruled out with a knee injury, but Fields' performance may have been sufficient to earn him further time in the No. 1 seat. Whoever is under center Week 10 could benefit from the return of WR Garrett Wilson (knee).
</div>

### 🟢 Mac Jones (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jones connected on all 14 of his first-half pass attempts for 143 yards, including touchdown passes of five yards to Christian McCaffrey and 11 yards to Jauan Jennings, but the quarterback lost a fumble in the final minute before halftime for the lone blemish of an otherwise spotless half. His first pass of the second half landed incomplete as Jones' accuracy diminished significantly, but the 49ers maintained a double-digit lead the entire second half to improve to 6-3, including 5-2 in games started by Jones. Brock Purdy (toe) has been inching closer to returning, so Jones' run as the starter could come to a close in Week 10 against the Rams.
</div>

### 🔴 Chris Godwin Jr. (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 Jaylin Lane (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Lane played 41 offensive snaps and served as Washington's No. 3 wideout while Terry McLaurin (quadriceps) and Noah Brown (groin) were sidelined in Week 9. The rookie from Virginia Tech tied his career high with three receptions and finished as the Commanders' third-leading receiver Sunday. He also contributed on special teams, returning two punts and one kickoff for 41 total yards. Following Sunday's performance, Lane's offensive role could continue to grow heading into the  Week 10 matchup against the Lions.
