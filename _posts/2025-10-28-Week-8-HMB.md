## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Zay Flowers (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The third-year wideout led the Ravens in receptions, targets and receiving yards as Tyler Huntley put together a very efficient performance against an injury-ravaged Bears secondary. Flowers tied his season high with the seven grabs, a mark he's reached four times in seven games while amassing a 41-486-1 line on 55 targets. Lamar Jackson (hamstring) could be back under center next week, but no matter who he's catching passes from, Flowers figures to be heavily involved in the game plan in Week 9 against the Dolphins.
</div>

### 🟢 Derrick Henry (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> With Lamar Jackson (hamstring) out again, Baltimore needed Henry to step up, and while he didn't break any gains longer than 10 yards, he came through when it counted with a pair of two-yard TD plunges in the second and fourth quarters. In the process, he moved past the legendary Walter Payton into sole possession of fifth place on the NFL's all-time rushing touchdowns list with 112. Six of those scores have come this season, along with 510 rushing yards in seven games, and he'll look to add to that total in Week 9 against the Dolphins.
</div>

### 🟢 Josh Allen (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Allen's modest passing numbers were a direct byproduct of how the game unfolded, as the Bills ultimately didn't need to put to much on the shoulders of their MVP. James Cook and the defense helped ensure a relatively easy day at the office for Allen with their exploits, but the star signal-caller still delivered for fantasy managers via a 54-yard touchdown pass to Khalil Shakir early in the third quarter, as well as a pair of one-yard scoring runs in the second and third quarters. Allen has multiple touchdowns in all but one game heading into a Week 9 home showdown with Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs next Sunday afternoon.
</div>

### 🟢 Sam LaPorta (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> LaPorta came out of Monday's primetime matchup with his worst receiving line of the season. The 24-year-old's targets and yardage both represented new lows in seven starts this year. LaPorta's dud comes on the heels of the tight end's best two fantasy outings in which he scored a touchdown apiece, so managers should hang tight through the Lions' upcoming bye week. Detroit resumes play against Minnesota on Sunday, Nov. 2 in Week 9.
</div>

### 🟢 Tucker Kraft (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Kraft scored the Packers' first and final touchdowns in a thrilling comeback victory, fittingly resulting in a career night on National Tight Ends Day. The 24-year-old was already riding a hot streak after scoring in each of his previous two outings, and he managed to surpass the combined production from those two starts with Sunday's statistical explosion. Kraft bumped his season line up to 29-469-6 through seven games, making him a premier fantasy option for next Sunday's tilt against Carolina.
</div>

### 🟢 Jordan Love (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Love was nearly flawless in Sunday's primetime victory. finishing with a season-high 78.3 percent completion rate. It was the 26-year-old's second time eclipsing 300 passing yards while throwing for three touchdowns this season. Interestingly, both occurrences have come on Sunday Night Football broadcasts, with Love throwing for 337 yards and three scores in a memorable 40-40 tie against Dallas in Week 4. It was fitting that Sunday's standout performance came against Packers legend Aaron Rodgers, as Love is doing his best prime Rodgers impersonation with 13 touchdowns to just two interceptions through seven starts in 2025. Love checks in as an elite fantasy option heading into a soft matchup against the Panthers in Week 9.
</div>

### 🟢 Kareem Hunt (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Hunt overcame a pair of minor injuries and a limited practice week in order to suit up for Monday's primetime tilt. The 29-year-old rewarded steadfast managers with his second multi-score performance this season. Isiah Pacheco (12-58-0) led the team in rushing yards, but Hunt's pair of scores lifted the veteran to the superior fantasy line. With a five total touchdowns to Pacheco's one, Hunt should continue being the favored back near the opponent's goal line for Sunday's road tilt against Buffalo.
</div>

### 🟢 Tre Tucker (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Tucker benefited from the absence of Jakobi Meyers (knee) and Brock Bowers (knee), but the performance of the Raiders' offense muted his stat line. Tucker led the team in every receiving stat, though three of his catches went for five yards or fewer.  The Raiders will now head into a Week 8 bye, which will likely allow both Meyers and Bowers to get healthy and push Tucker down in priority for targets in the offense when the team retakes the field  against the Jaguars in Week 9.
</div>

### 🟢 Keenan Allen (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Ladd McConkey and Oronde Gadsden posted a combined 11-165-2 line, which rendered Allen a clear tertiary component of the air attack on the night. Nevertheless, the veteran receiver continued to offer serviceable real-world and fantasy production -- all of his receptions Thursday resulted in first downs -- and he extended his season-opening streak of games with at least four receptions to eight contests overall. Allen will take a 48-479-4 line on 70 targets into a Week 9 road matchup against the Titans on Sunday, Nov. 2.
</div>

### 🟢 Blake Corum (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Corum was able to work back from an ankle injury that limited him during the practice week in order to suit up for Sunday's overseas tilt in London. The 24-year-old wound up handling a season-high 12 carries, matching starter Kyren Williams (12-54-0) in a game dominated by Los Angeles' passing attack. It is important to note that half of Corum's carries came late in the fourth quarter with the game well out of reach, so this was unlikely a changing of the guard in the Rams' backfield. The 2024 third-round pick was averaging 4.8 rushing attempts per game prior to the Week 7 outburst, so managers should keep expectations in check coming out of the Rams' upcoming bye week.
</div>

### 🟢 Kenneth Gainwell (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Gainwell was the lone backup running back to take the field for the Steelers, as Kaleb Johnson didn't see any playing time in the primetime loss. Gainwell played 38 percent of the team's offensive snaps and was relatively efficient on the ground, but he didn't have enough volume to provide much fantasy value. While Gainwell has consistently outpaced Johnson's snap count over the first half of the season, Jaylen Warren has operated as the Steelers' clear lead back, making Gainwell an unreliable fantasy option.
</div>

### 🟢 Sterling Shepard (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The veteran wideout started the Week 7 loss to the Lions working as the No. 3 receiver, but he bumped up a notch on the depth chart during the game when Evans exited with his pair of injuries. Shepard wound up with a season-high seven receptions on his seven targets against Detroit, albeit while netting only 25 receiving yards. Sunday, Shepard is due to begin the game as the No. 2 wideout, and he could certainly benefit from the defensive attention likely to be showered on rookie position mate Emeka Egbuka.
</div>

### 🟢 Cam Ward (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Ward threw his fifth touchdown pass of the season Sunday, but he maintained a TD/INT below 1.0 after throwing the sixth pick of his rookie campaign. The first-overall pick has shown marginal improvements in the two games following the firing of head coach Brian Callahan, throwing for over 250 yards in both contests. Ward still hasn't had that breakout game to excite fantasy managers through eight weeks, making him a low-end option against the Rams in Week 9.
</div>

### 🟢 Jacory Croskey-Merritt (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Croskey-Merritt was held under 3.0 yards per carry for the second consecutive game in what was a second straight lopsided loss for the Commanders. The rookie back outpaced backfield mates Chris Rodriguez and Jeremy McNichols by eight carries each, but McNichols was much more involved in the passing game while recording a team-high five catches and 64 yards while also logging a co-team-high six targets. Meanwhile, Croskey-Merritt continued to be an afterthought in the passing game, a trend that conspires to limit his fantasy value when rushing opportunities and/or running room is at a premium. The outlook doesn't get any rosier Week 9, as the Commanders welcome a tough Seahawks defense to town for a Sunday night showdown.
</div>

### 🟢 Luke McCaffrey (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> McCaffrey wasn't able to take advantage of absences of Terry McLaurin (quadriceps), Noah Brown (groin/knee, IR) and Deebo Samuel (heel) versus Dallas, though the departure of quarterback Jayden Daniels (hamstring) early in the second half didn't help matters. He had scored in three of four contests leading up to the Week 7 loss, but versus the Cowboys all of rookie fourth-rounder Jaylin Lane, veteran receivers Chris Moore and Robbie Chosen and tight end Zach Ertz finished with more targets and yardage than McCaffrey, That will make him difficult to trust for fantasy purposes heading into a tough primetime matchup against the Chiefs on Monday, Oct. 27 in Week 8, especially if Daniels is unable to go and Marcus Mariota draws the start at QB.
