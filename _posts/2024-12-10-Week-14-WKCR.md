## Player Report

#### Tyler Allgeier (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** This was by far Allgeier's best performance since Week 6, when he rushed 18 times for 105 yards and a score -- all season-high marks. This was the fifth time in 13 games that Allgeier finished with at least 7.0 yards per carry, and he's now at 5.0 for the season, which would top the career-best 4.9 mark he set as a rookie. Despite the strong outing, Allgeier has garnered double-digit rushing attempts only three times this season and remains a sporadic producer while operating as Bijan Robinson's backup.
#### Mark Andrews (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Andrews continued his midseason surge with his seventh touchdown over his last eight appearances. Fellow tight end Isaiah Likely (5-38-1) also hit pay dirt, as the two teammates continue to establish themselves as best one-two punch at the position. Andrews will enter the upcoming bye week with 43 receptions, 490 yards and seven scores before returning to face the Giants on Dec. 15.
#### Derrick Henry (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Henry didn't post a monstrous stat line like we have become accustomed to over the course of his storied career, but he still produced 111 yards from scrimmage without turning the ball over. The simple fact that this performance checked out as one of Henry's lowest fantasy scores of the season paints a picture of how dominant King Henry has been since aligning with Lamar Jackson in Baltimore this season. With the added rest from Baltimore's upcoming bye, Henry should be locked in for a strong finish to the campaign when the Ravens resume play against the Giants on Dec. 15.
#### Lamar Jackson (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Jackson did put two balls on the ground Sunday, but both were recovered by either himself or a teammate to stave off any potential turnovers. The dual-threat QB accounted for over 300 combined yards of offense for the seventh time this season. Despite suffering a hard-fought loss, Jackson remains one of the premier fantasy players across the NFL. The two-time MVP has thrown for 3,290 passing yards with 29 touchdowns to just three interceptions in addition to 678 yards and three more scores as a rusher through 13 games. The Ravens will lick their wounds from this battle of birds over the upcoming bye week before resuming play against the Giants on Dec. 15.
#### Keon Coleman (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** questionable
#### Amari Cooper (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Cooper had been slow to make an impact in the Buffalo offense, as he had failed to top four receptions or 66 yards in four games with the team. That changed against the Rams, as he easily paced the team in targets and had a team-high six receptions. While it wasn't the most efficient showing, Cooper did have long gains of 26, 25 and 18 yards. He should have momentum heading into a Week 15 showdown with the Lions, though the Bills could also be welcoming back Keon Coleman (wrist) and Dalton Kincaid (knee).
#### DJ Moore (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Moore overcame a quadriceps injury to suit up Sunday and led the Bears in all receiving categories except scoring. That honor went to rookie wideout Rome Odunze, who cashed in both of Caleb Williams' late touchdown strikes in the lopsided loss. Moore's production paled in comparison to his previous two contests in which he racked up 15 receptions for 203 yards and two scores. The durable receiver should remain a focal point of Chicago's passing attack when the team visits Minnesota next Monday.
#### Caleb Williams (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Williams and Chicago's offense were nearly invisible Sunday, netting just four yards over five drives (all of which ended in a punt) in the first half. The first-overall pick from this year's draft was able to pad his stats out of the break with a pair of touchdown throws that never threatened the 49ers' lead. On the bright side, Williams has now thrown seven touchdowns over his last three contests after failing to generate one over his previous four appearances. Things won't get any easier for the Bears as they prepare to visit the Vikings next Monday.
#### Ja'Marr Chase (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Chase shined under the bright lights in Arlington, TX with a signature performance that helped lift his team back into the playoff race. The LSU product teamed up with college QB Joe Burrow to connect for two scores on a season-high 14 connections, including the game-winning touchdown to put away the Cowboys on Monday. Chase carries a ridiculous 93-1,319-15 receiving line into Sunday's road tilt against Tennessee.
#### Rico Dowdle (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Dowdle consistently gashed the Bengals' lackluster run defense throughout the night, recording a game-long 27-yard run and finishing with a career-high rushing yardage total in the process. The 26-year-old now has back-to-back 100-yard performances and no fewer than 86 rushing yards in three straight games heading into a highly favorable Week 15 road matchup against the Panthers.
#### Audric Estime (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Estime played just eight of the Broncos' 66 offensive snaps, behind teammates Javonte Williams (30) and Jaleel McLaughlin (24). With head coach Sean Payton allowing for a more fluid rotation in the Denver backfield from week to week, Estime appears to be the odd man out recently, handling just 12 total carries over the past three games. With such limited usage, Estime should remain off the fantasy radar going forward barring injuries to either Williams or McLaughlin. The Broncos will host the Colts on Dec. 15 when they return from their Week 14 bye.
#### Javonte Williams (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Javonte played 30 of the Broncos' 66 offensive snaps Monday, ahead of both Jaleel McLaughlin (24) and Audric Estime (8). Despite seeing the most playing time of the group, Williams saw fewer touches than McLaughlin, who finished the game with 14 carries for 84 yards. A complete disaster was avoided when the 24-year-old Williams was able to score his fourth touchdown of the season on a two-yard run in the first quarter. It appears head coach Sean Payton is committed to using a hot-hand approach with Denver's backfield, so fantasy managers may want to avoid the entire situation down the stretch. The Broncos will host the Colts on Dec. 15 following their Week 14 bye.
#### Josh Downs (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** questionable
#### Brock Bowers (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Bowers came into the game with a pair of 100-yard tallies in the previous three contests and was facing a defense that had been vulnerable to tight ends all season. However, Bowers was largely contained by the Buccaneers, with fellow tight end Michael Mayer doing the majority of the damage at the position with a 7-68 line on nine targets. Bowers did turn in a 25-yard catch, and his final reception of the day, a 12-yard grab with 27 seconds remaining, vaulted him into the record books for most receptions by a rookie tight end (87). Bowers next takes aim at the vulnerable Falcons defense in a Week 15 home matchup Monday night, Dec. 16.
#### Puka Nacua (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Nacua accounted for 14 targets on 30 passes, and he showed strong rapport with Matthew Stafford throughout the high-scoring win. His longest reception of the day went for 21 yards, though he also had a pair of 19-yard grabs -- one of which went for a score to clinch the win and the other on an impressive leaping toe-tapping catch along the sideline. Nacua was also used as a runner and racked up a season-high five attempts, highlighted by a four-yard score. In seven games since returning from injured reserve, he's topped 100 receiving yards on four occasions.
#### Tua Tagovailoa (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Tagovailoa completed 15 of 18 passes for 165 yards in the first half but failed to produce a passing touchdown. His completion percentage fell off after halftime, but Tua threw a four-yard touchdown pass to Tyreek Hill followed by a two-point conversion to Jaylen Waddle to tie the game 23-23 with 9:04 remaining in the fourth quarter. The quarterback later guided the Dolphins into position for a game-tying 52-yard Jason Sanders field goal in the final seconds of regulation, then drove right down the field on the first possession of overtime to clinch the victory with a 10-yard touchdown pass to Jonnu Smith. Tagovailoa has topped 300 passing yards in three consecutive starts while posting an 8:0 TD:INT over that span, and he'll look to keep rolling in Week 15 against the Texans.
#### Jalen McMillan (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** McMillan hadn't found the end zone since recording a 32-yard touchdown on his first career catch back in Week 1 against the Commanders, but he made up for some lost time Sunday with 15- and 29-yard scoring grabs in the first and fourth quarters, respectively. The speedy wideout's catch total also tied his career high, while his yardage tally was a new high-water mark for the rookie third-round pick. McMillan's surge was a welcome sight considering how little production the Buccaneers have gotten from the No. 2 receiver position since Chris Godwin was lost for the season with an ankle dislocation, and he'll look to put together a successful encore in a Week 15 road matchup against the Chargers.
#### Tyjae Spears (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Spears remained the backup to Tony Pollard in the loss, though he did see a significant increase in involvement compared to his one carry in Week 13. Spears had a strong pass-catching role to begin the season, though his current lack of involvement as a receiver further dings his fantasy value.
