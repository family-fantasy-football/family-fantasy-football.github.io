## Player Report

#### Khalil Shakir (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Shakir is back on the practice field for the first time since suffering a right high-ankle sprain Aug. 1, so even being restricted to limited reps would represent a significant step in the right direction. Head coach Sean McDermott has expressed optimism about Shakir's chances of being available Week 1, so even if Buffalo opts to take a cautious approach to the No. 1 wideout's health, look for his activity level to ramp up in advance of Buffalo's regular-season opener against Baltimore on Sunday, Sept. 7.
#### RJ Harvey (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Harvey was the first running back to record a carry, and he was in on Denver's first three possessions overall with the rest of the first-team offense. The rookie second-round pick got some solid work in during preseason, finishing Denver's three-game exhibition slate with a 13-47 rushing line and three receptions for seven yards on four targets. Harvey heads into his first NFL season set to operate in tandem with veteran J.K. Dobbins atop the Broncos' running back depth chart.
#### Woody Marks (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The 2025 fourth-round pick made a strong final impression for the coaching staff, scoring the Texans' first TD of the afternoon on a nine-yard run early in the second quarter. With Joe Mixon (foot/ankle) uncertain for Week 1 and potentially headed for a stay on the PUP list, Marks could have a role in the offense right out of the gate behind Nick Chubb and Dameon Pierce.
#### Daniel Jones (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Colts coach Shane Steichen reportedly informed Jones and Anthony Richardson of his decision Tuesday morning. There wasn't a decisive winner in the QB competition over two preseason games, but Jones seemingly made a better impression on the practice field this spring and summer. His poor track record with the Giants suggests Richardson is likely to make starts at some point this season, however.
#### Bhayshul Tuten (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Tuten tied for the team lead in carries but served as the third back. Travis Etienne worked exclusively with the starting skill-position unit, with Tank Bigsby following him. That left Tuten to work primarily late in the second quarter and much of the second half. He did find the end zone from eight yards away early in the fourth quarter, but his role come the regular season is in question.
#### Tre' Harris (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Harris exited a practice last Wednesday due to an unspecified issue, but his absence from the Week 1 injury report implies that he took every rep during Tuesday's session. The rookie second-round receiver out of Ole Miss will be available for Friday's season opener versus the Chiefs in Sao Paulo, Brazil, but it's unclear if he'll be able to immediately earn meaningful target volume on the perimeter after the Chargers brought aboard veteran slot man Keenan Allen in August to complement No. 1 wideout Ladd McConkey and third-year man Quentin Johnston.
#### Justin Herbert (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Herbert made a brief appearance, leading one drive that went nine plays and 51 yards. Though his completion percentage left something to be desired, Herbert displayed plenty to be encouraged about, connecting early with Ladd McConkey on a short pass before hitting KeAndre Lambert-Smith for a 29-yard gain down the left sideline. Herbert may not see the field again until the regular season, but he appears ready to roll if that is the case.
#### T.J. Hockenson (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** It was surprising to see Hockenson play in the first preseason game given his injury scare earlier in the week. Even though he didn't do much in the game, it shows he's ready for the regular season.
#### Drake Maye (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Maye logged two drives apiece in both of the Patriots' first two exhibitions, completing seven of 12 passes for 58 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions, rushing twice for 16 yards and a TD and losing a fumble. He thus has a number of reps under his belt ahead of his second campaign after throwing for 2,276 yards and a 15:10 TD:INT on 66.6 percent passing and turning 54 carries into 421 yards and two scores in 13 regular-season appearances (12 starts) as a rookie.
#### Alvin Kamara (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Fantasy managers are just fine with that, after Kamara made it through training camp without any report of injury troubles or missed time. The Saints used some of their other starters in multiple preseason games, which allowed RB Kendre Miller to get a bunch of first-team work. Miller thus stands as the favorite to enter Week 1 against Arizona as Kamara's top backup, although it's a fluid situation, with rookie Devin Neal just recently coming back from a hamstring injury and Clyde Edwards-Helaire perhaps competing for a small role.
