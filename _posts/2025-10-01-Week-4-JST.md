## Player Report

#### Michael Penix Jr. (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** After a rough Week 3 performance on the road in Carolina, Penix returned home in Week 4 and looked much more composed, topping his prior career high in yardage by one as he delivered his first multi-TD effort of 2025. The second-year QB hit Drake London for a five-yard score in the first quarter and Kyle Pitts for a seven-yard touchdown in the third, while both London and Bijan Robinson eclipsed the century mark in receiving yards, during a game in which Atlanta never trailed. Penix will get a week off for the Falcons' bye before facing a tough test in Week 6 against the Bills.
#### Jalen Coker (WR)
**Injury Status:** Injured Reserve <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** It sounds like Coker won't be ready to return from injured reserve when first eligible in Week 5. He was expected to miss four-to-six games all along, with his return likely to come at some point in October. With the Panthers not getting much from their pass catchers so far, Coker should push for a starting job before mid-season.
#### D'Andre Swift (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Swift was limited during the practice week with a hip injury that had him listed as questionable leading up to Sunday's kickoff. The veteran RB suited up and rewarded fantasy managers with his second trip to the end zone in four games this season. The Bears placed no restrictions on Swift, handing him 14 of its 18 running back carries in the win. He has been generating just enough value on a weekly basis to warrant flex consideration in most formats, but he won't be available in Week 5 with the Bears on a bye, making Week 6 the next time Swift will be in action.
#### Caleb Williams (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Williams also put two balls on the ground, but he was fortunately able to recover both of his fumbles. The sophomore QB was coming off his best game of the season against the Cowboys, but he reverted to inconsistent form Sunday. We have seen flashes of brilliance from Williams in new head coach Ben Johnson's scheme, but he still isn't polished enough to be relied upon regularly. With the Bears entering their bye, Williams' next action will come in Week 6 on Oct. 13 against the Commanders on Monday Night Football.
#### Rome Odunze (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Odunze's scoring onslaught continued when he gutted the Raiders' secondary for a 27-yard touchdown on Chicago's first possession of the second half. The breakout fantasy star has generated five touchdowns during his impressive four-game scoring streak to kick off the season. Odunze's eight targets Sunday were on par with his 8.8 average through four weeks, giving fantasy managers a reliable WR1 asset so far. The talented sophomore will attempt to extend his scoring streak when the Bears resume play against the Commanders in Week 6 on Oct. 13 following the team's upcoming bye.
#### Travis Kelce (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Patrick Mahomes spread the ball around relatively evenly in the Kansas City offense, with Kelce being one of three players earning either five or six targets. The veteran tight end finished second on the team in yardage, logging long receptions of 15 and 12 yards. Though Kelce is no longer an elite fantasy option, he still has at least four receptions in each of his last three games while also topping 45 yards in three of four contests this year.
#### Hunter Henry (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The veteran tight end continued to flash encouraging chemistry with Drake Maye, getting into the end zone for the third time in the last two games on a 31-yard catch to cap off the first drive of the second half. Henry's reception and target totals have fluctuated considerably week to week, but a Week 5 road battle against the Bills next Sunday night could well turn out to be one of his busier games considering New England figures to have to remain aggressive on offense.
#### Chris Olave (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Olave logged his first touchdown of the season with a three-yard scoring grab in the third quarter. This was the silver lining, as he posted season lows in catches, targets and yards, while the Saints had more rushing attempts (34) than passing attempts (28) for the first time this season. Olave also threw an interception on his first career passing attempt. The fifth-year wideout tried to hit quarterback Spencer Rattler on a Philly Special-style trick play in the red zone, but the Bills sniffed out the play and picked it off to end the second quarter. Olave has shown good PPR value through four weeks, averaging 6.5 catches on 10.5 targets per game, but he's yet to record over 57 receiving yards in any contest. He'll look to record double-digit targets for the fourth time this season during New Orleans' next game versus the Giants on Sunday, Oct. 5.
#### Will Shipley (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** It was good to see Shipley back on the field, but his role was almost exclusively limited to special teams, where he featured as a kick returner. He played just three offensive snaps and did not receive a carry nor catch a pass, though he was targeted once.
#### DeVonta Smith (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Smith had the Eagles' second-longest gain through the air of the afternoon with a 20-yard reception, but his production stalled during another very quiet day for the air attack. The 2021 first-round pick has multiple receptions in every game thus far, but after clearing the 50-yard threshold in the previous two contests, Smith mustered his second-lowest yardage total of the campaign Sunday. He could be hard-pressed to improve much on his relatively modest 17-158-1 line in Week 5, as a stingy Broncos secondary pays a visit to the defending champions.
#### Jalen Hurts (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** The Eagles' air attack was back to low-volume mode Sunday, despite the Buccaneers eventually making matters interesting in the second half. Hurts had his share of misfires against an aggressive Tampa Bay defense, but he connected on two nifty touchdown passes to Dallas Goedert at the shadow of the goal line and also mustered a team- and co-season-high rushing yardage total. After not throwing a touchdown pass in either of the first two games of the season, Hurts has bounced back to toss five in the last pair of contests, and he's yet to throw an interception despite a couple of close calls Sunday. Hurts will take on the unenviable task of facing the Broncos defense when Denver pays a visit next Sunday afternoon for a Week 5 interconference showdown.
#### Kaleb Johnson (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Jaylen Warren's (knee) absence opened up a lot of opportunity in the Pittsburgh backfield. Kenneth Gainwell was the primary back and performed well, though Johnson did see the most significant opportunity of his rookie season. He was servicable in the role, picking up 14 yards on the ground on a drive early in the fourth quarter to help the Steelers to a field goal.  Johnson isn't likely to see much of a role when Pittsburgh returns to the field in Week 6, but it was a small step forward after a poor start to his rookie campaign.
#### DK Metcalf (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Metcalf found the end zone in his third straight game while also tallying his first 100-yard receiving game as a Steeler. He did the majority of his damage on an 80-yard touchdown early in the second quarter, which came nearly entirely after the catch. Metcalf continues to be Aaron Rodgers' favorite target among the downfield pass catchers, and he has at least 80 receiving yards in half of his four games in his nascent Steelers tenure.
#### Christian McCaffrey (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** McCaffrey stuck to the script that has been unfolding for him through four weeks, with another monster receiving effort that helped mask inefficient rushing totals. The 29-year-old is averaging a career worst 3.3 yards per carry with no rushing touchdowns through four games. Nearly all of his production has come through the air (31-305-2 on a massive 43 targets), but the total package is still elite from a fantasy perspective. CMC is averaging 26.3 combined touches in four starts this season, giving him an extremely high floor heading into Thursday's tilt against the Rams.
#### Rachaad White (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Game script dictated the Buccaneers take a pass-heavy approach for significant portions of the afternoon, but White still logged a typical complementary workload on the ground. The fact Tampa Bay was trailing throughout the contest also afforded him his fair share of work as a pass catcher, leading to season-high figures in receptions and receiving yards. The veteran back figures to profile in a similar fashion during a challenging Week 5 road matchup against the Seahawks on Sunday.
