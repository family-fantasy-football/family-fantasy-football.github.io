## Player Report

#### Michael Penix Jr. (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The Falcons played from ahead for the entire game, and the team was happy to rely on its running game. That limited Penix's pass attempts, though he wasn't all that efficient with his opportunity, averaging only 6.43 yards per attempt while primarily targeting short areas of the field. Atlanta may be able to control their Week 3 matchup against Carolina in similar fashion, which could lead to another quiet performance from Penix.
#### Caleb Williams (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Williams' final line was serviceable, but the final score underscores how dominant the Lions were overall. The 2024 first overall pick looked especially impressive in the first half while connecting with Rome Odunze for touchdown passes of 28 and six yards, but he helped lead the Bears to only seven second-half points. Williams connected with seven different targets in his second game in head coach Ben Johnson's offense, and he clearly remains a work in progress in the quarterback-friendly system heading into a Week 3 home matchup against the Cowboys next Sunday.
#### Rome Odunze (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Odunze, in conjunction with Caleb Williams, single-handedly kept the Bears competitive in the first quarter, recording 28- and six-yard touchdown grabs in the first and second quarter, respectively. Odunze easily led the Bears in receptions, receiving yards and targets on the afternoon, and although his career-best day was sullied by the sizable loss, it was certainly encouraging to see the emphasis on getting the second-year wideout involved in Ben Johnson's offense. Odunze next takes aim at a Cowboys secondary that allowed 450 passing yards and three touchdowns to the Giants' Russell Wilson, as Dallas comes into the Windy City for a Week 3 showdown next Sunday.
#### D'Andre Swift (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Swift was able to serve as a bright spot for the Bears' offense on a mostly forgettable afternoon, putting together an efficient performance on the ground that included a three-yard touchdown run early in the fourth quarter. However, Swift also short-circuited what appeared to be a scoring drive when he lost a fumble at the Lions' 31-yard line late in the first quarter. Through two games, Swift remains the clear No. 1 back in Chicago's ground attack, and he'll have a favorable matchup at home against the Cowboys in a Week 3 showdown next Sunday.
#### Jayden Reed (WR)
**Injury Status:** Out <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Rapoport previously reported Friday that Reed will undergo surgery next week to address the injury, and the estimated 6-to-8-week recovery timeline will keep him out through early-to-mid-November. The Packers will likely place Reed on injured reserve in the coming days to open up a spot on the 53-man roster. While Reed is sidelined, the Packers should have extra snaps available for all of the remaining members of their deep rotation of receivers (Matthew Golden, Romeo Doubs, Dontayvion Wicks, Savion Williams and Malik Heath). Through Green Bay's first two games, Doubs is the only Packers receiver to play more than 70 percent of snaps (71 percent Week 1, 74 percent Week 2).
#### Travis Kelce (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Kelce led all Kansas City receivers in targets (six) and receiving yards (61), but he was unable to replicate the trip to the end zone that he secured for fantasy managers last week. The 35-year-old did fare better against the Eagles this time around after being held to 39 yards with no touchdowns when these two teams met in Super Bowl LIX this past February. With a thin receiver room due to absences from Rashee Rice (suspension) and Xavier Worthy (shoulder), Kelce remains a focal point on offense for a team struggling out of the gates. The Chiefs will attempt to secure their first win of the season in a road matchup against the Giants next Sunday.
#### Hunter Henry (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Fellow tight end Austin Hooper logged 37 snaps and caught all three of his targets for 38 yards. Given that Henry -- who caught four of eight targets for 66 yards in Week 1 -- was on the field for nearly every play Sunday, he'll have an opportunity to make a fantasy contribution most weeks, but the Patriots' upgraded WR room gives Drake Maye more options in the passing game than he had in 2024, when the veteran TE posted career highs in catches (66), targets (97) and yards (674).
#### Chris Olave (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** The fourth-year wideout led the Saints in volume once again while seeing double-digit targets from Spencer Rattler for the second straight game. Olave is still looking for his first TD, and his first breakout performance, of 2025, but his usage in new head coach Kellen Moore's scheme suggests both will come in due time. Olave will take on a Seahawks secondary in Week 3 that has been stingy so far against WRs, but which did give up a TD to DK Metcalf in Week 2.
#### Will Shipley (RB)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** questionable
#### DeVonta Smith (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Smith finished as the Eagles' leading receiver in a game during which his team threw for just 101 yards. It was a marked improvement from the veteran starter following last Thursday's three-catch, 16-yard stinker in a win over the Cowboys. Expect Smith and the entire Philadelphia passing attack to be more involved next Sunday lining up opposite the Rams' high-powered passing attack.
#### Jalen Hurts (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Hurts managed to outduel Patrick Mahomes for the second time this calendar year in a Week 2 rematch of Super Bowl LIX. The 26-year-old Hurts has yet to throw a touchdown pass (or interception) through two starts in 2025, but his team has come out victorious on both occasions. Fantasy managers who drafted the dual-threat QB for his legs have been forced to rely almost exclusively on that part of his game for production early in the schedule. Hurts' rushing totals through two games (23-77-3) resemble that of an RB1 in fantasy, highlighting what an advantage it is to have a mobile QB. The Eagles may call on Hurts to air it out more against the high-powered Rams when the NFC contenders face off next Sunday.
#### Kaleb Johnson (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Johnson was on the field for just two offensive snaps for a second consecutive week. He played four snaps on special teams, but he didn't pursue a ball that bounced past him on a kickoff in the fourth quarter, which allowed Seattle to recover in the end zone for a touchdown. The 22-year-old showcased some promise during the preseason after being selected in the third round of this year's draft, but he hasn't had a role in Pittsburgh's offense behind Jaylen Warren and Kenneth Gainwell, and Johnson did little to instill confidence in Week 2.
#### DK Metcalf (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** The Steelers' passing attack took a significant step backward relative to Week 1, and Metcalf's output fell accordingly. He still led the team with six targets, though his longest gain went for only nine yards. Metcalf managed to salvage his day with a leaping two-yard touchdown shortly before halftime for his first score as a Steeler, though it was otherwise a forgettable performance.
#### Christian McCaffrey (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** With the 49ers' offense missing a number of key players, including Brock Purdy (toe/shoulder), George Kittle (hamstring) and Brandon Aiyuk (knee), McCaffrey put the team on his back and carried it to a second straight victory to begin the season. His seven-yard TD reception from Mac Jones just before halftime was McCaffrey's first score of the year, but he's topped 100 scrimmage yards in both of the Niners' games so far. In Week 3, he'll take aim at a Cardinals defense he didn't face during an injury-plagued 2024, but which he lit up for an incredible 364 combined yards and seven total touchdowns in their two 2023 meetings.
#### Rachaad White (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** White logged seven fewer carries than backfield mate Bucky Irving, but the former finished with only six fewer rushing yards. Additionally, White was the only one of the two backs to cross the goal line, powering in off right guard with six seconds remaining for the game-winning touchdown. White is still a clear complementary option to Irvin, but after taking only two carries in the Week 1 win over the Falcons, his workload boost Monday night was encouraging for fantasy managers. White next takes aim at a Jets defense Week 3 that just allowed 132 yards on 21 carries to the Bills' James Cook on Sunday.
