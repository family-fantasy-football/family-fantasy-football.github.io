## Player Report

#### James Conner (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** The veteran was bottled up at the line of scrimmage and watched second-year back Trey Benson break off a 52-yard gain to help him lead the Cardinals in rushing on the day, but Conner was able to make an impact with a four-yard TD catch on an underhand flip from Kyler Murray in the second quarter. Benson was expected to cut into Conner's workload as the 2025 season progressed, but the split could tip even further in the youngster's favor based on the duo's Week 1 performances. Conner will look to reinforce his claim to the RB1 role at home Week 2 against the Panthers.
#### Ray-Ray McCloud III (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Darnell Mooney (shoulder) was inactive, plus Drake London (shoulder) and Jamal Agnew (groin) both suffered injuries during the opener. London's injury came during Atlanta's final drive, while Agnew didn't see any offensive snaps before exiting, so the in-game injuries didn't boost McCloud's role. Mooney's absence may have funnelled a few more targets to McCloud, who finished fourth on the team in receiving yards behind Bijan Robinson (100), Kyle Pitts (59) and London (55). McCloud posted career highs in receptions (62), targets (87) and receiving yards (686) last season with Kirk Cousins at the helm until the final three games, and if Week 1 was any indication, the veteran wideout will also be a key part of the offense under Michael Penix, who threw 42 times against Tampa Bay and targeted McCloud on 12 occasions over the second-year signal-caller's trio of starts to finish the 2024 campaign. McCloud will be the primary slot receiver when everyone is healthy, but he may have expanded responsibilities if London and Mooney miss extended time.
#### Rashod Bateman (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** It was a disappointing outing for Bateman in such a high-scoring affair, but he did manage to finish second in targets among Baltimore receiving options. The 2021 first-round selection posted a career best 45-756-9 receiving line for the Ravens in 2024, so there is hope that the No. 2 wideout can produce better numbers than what we saw in Sunday's loss. Bateman's next opportunity to cash in that potential comes in a home matchup against the Browns next Sunday.
#### Zay Flowers (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Flowers overcame an undisclosed injury during the practice week in order to suit up for Baltimore's season opener. Fantasy managers were elated to not only see the speedy receiver in the starting lineup, but also back producing true WR1 numbers after suffering a knee sprain in Week 18 last year. The 143 receiving yards set a new high-water mark for the third-year wideout, while his nine targets finished five ahead of the second-highest player (Rashod Bateman). Flowers is shaping up to be an elite fantasy option heading into next Sunday's tilt against the Browns.
#### Derrick Henry (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Henry suffered the lowlight of Sunday's contest when the normally sure-handed back coughed up a fumble on Baltimore's second-to-last drive, allowing Buffalo to score a TD with just under two minutes remaining to close the gap to 40-38. Fantasy managers won't lost any sleep over the rare fumble, as it came on the heels of a monstrous statistical performance from the 31-year-old. The perennial All-Pro lost just one fumble over his last two full seasons, so Sunday's faux pas should be considered an anomaly. Henry is showing no signs of slowing down heading into a Week 2 matchup against the Browns.
#### Josh Allen (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Allen opened the scoring with a 15-yard touchdown pass to Dalton Kincaid on the opening drive, but the Ravens responded with a 20-3 run. Allen and the offense kept Buffalo within striking distance in the second half, and the dual-threat quarterback scored a two-yard rushing touchdown early in the fourth quarter, two plays after connecting with James Cook for a 51-yard gain through the air. That rushing score was the 66th of Allen's regular-season career, surpassing Thurman Thomas for the most in Bills history. Allen then tossed a 10-yard touchdown pass to Keon Coleman and added a one-yard rushing touchdown before guiding the offense in position for a game-winning field goal in the final seconds of a fourth quarter that featured 251 Allen passing yards, as the Bills played their best football down the stretch while the Ravens sputtered. With the other three AFC East teams all losing Sunday, the Bills already hold the division lead heading into a Week 2 road game against the Jets.
#### Cedric Tillman (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Tillman snagged a five-yard pass on a crossing route in the back of the end zone for Cleveland's lone touchdown. He also had one of three fourth-quarter drops by Browns receivers. His drop with 1:24 remaining was the dagger, as it bounded off his hands and into the arms of the Bengals' DJ Turner. Despite the drop, a lot went right in Week 1 for Tillman, who saw good target volume and had a 25-yard reception. After flashing in the middle of the 2024 season, a concussion ended his year after Week 12 and left his status for 2025 up in the air. Tillman enters the season as the No. 2 wideout opposite Jerry Jeudy, and nothing that transpired Sunday will change that.
#### Sam LaPorta (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** LaPorta was the bright spot in an otherwise underwhelming offensive performance from Detroit, as he led the team in yards and finished second in targets. He also accounted for the team's longest play from scrimmage on a 32-yard catch and run to begin the second half. LaPorta isn't likely to consistently see nine targets as he shares looks with Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jameson Williams, but he will be a key part of Detroit's offense -- particularly in the red zone.
#### Amon-Ra St. Brown (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** The Lions' offense struggled to get going for most of the game, with both St. Brown and Jameson Williams putting up muted stats as a result. St. Brown managed only one catch that went for more than nine yards, though he still finished second on the team in receiving yards. Detroit will return home for a Week 2 matchup against the Bears, and the offense should be in line for better results.
#### Najee Harris (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Head coach Jim Harbaugh said in advance of Friday's opener that Harris would play but that Omarion Hampton would draw the start, and the rookie ultimately handled a workhorse role. Hampton totaled 17 touches against the Chiefs' firm defensive front, rushing 15 times for 48 yards and securing both of his targets for 13 yards. Harris' backfield role could grow as he puts further distance between himself and the minor eye injury that forced him to sit out all of training camp and the preseason, but Hampton looks solidified as the starter in Los Angeles' backfield and projects to dominate touches again in Week 2 on the road against Las Vegas.
#### Keenan Allen (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Signed exactly one month ago, Allen hopped into the Chargers' starting lineup and balled like he never departed for Chicago last season. The 33-year-old wound up leading Los Angeles in targets (10) and receptions (seven) while securing his 60th touchdown as a member of the Chargers. Allen's fantasy value in drafts matched his free-agent appeal up until Friday's renaissance, but the veteran is definitely worth consideration against the Raiders next Monday.
#### Cam Ward (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Ward drew a tough assignment in his pro debut in a difficult road environment against a defense that is projected to be one of the best in the league. His stat line reflects that, as he managed only 4.0 yards per attempt while also taking six sacks. Ward was slightly off target on a few passes to Calvin Ridley that could have changed the trajectory of his performance, but the duo should gain increased chemistry as the season progresses.
#### Jacory Croskey-Merritt (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Croskey-Merritt got as many rushing attempts as Austin Ekeler and Jeremy McNichols combined. The highlights of the rookie seventh-round pick's NFL debut were a six-yard touchdown run in the second quarter and a 42-yard run in the fourth. Croskey-Merritt looks like the team's go-to option on early downs heading into Thursday's Week 2 game at Green Bay, but his lack of pass-catching ability should allow Ekeler to stay involved in passing situations.
