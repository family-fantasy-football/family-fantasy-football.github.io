## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Emari Demercado (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> After playing just seven snaps on offense in last week's loss to the Texans, Demercado saw increased playing time in Week 16 with the Cardinals placing Bam Knight (ankle) on injured reserve ahead of the game. Demercado ended up playing 18 of the Cardinals' 57 offensive snaps and ripped off gains of at least five yards on four of his carries, but he still played second fiddle to Michael Carter out of the backfield. Carter (11 carries for 65 yards, zero receptions on two targets) ended up logging 30 snaps and appears poised to lead the Arizona backfield in opportunities over the final two weeks of the season.
</div>

### 🟡 Rome Odunze (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Bears won't have to submit their next injury report until Wednesday, but if his lack of activity Tuesday is any indication, Odunze looks poised to remain a non-participant in practice to begin Week 17 prep. Earlier Tuesday, head coach Ben Johnson told Courtney Cronin of ESPN.com that Odunze is in a "good spot" in his recovery and remains on track to play again this season, but the wideout doesn't look to be pushing for a return for this Sunday's game in San Francisco. Odunze hasn't taken the field for any of the Bears' last three games due to a stress fracture in his foot, which he aggravated again while warming up prior to a Week 15 game against the Browns.
</div>

### 🟢 D'Andre Swift (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Swift maintained a modest edge as the Bears' lead back, totaling 15 touches to 12 for Kyle Monangai. The former's longest gain from scrimmage went for only nine yards, though he still managed a relatively efficient performance in a tough matchup. The Bears were forced into an atypically pass-heavy offensive approach, which led to modest individual numbers in the rushing game and Swift's lowest yardage output since Week 12.
</div>

### 🟢 Caleb Williams (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> This game followed a similar script to the first contest between the Packers and Bears, though Williams completed the improbable comeback this time around. He attempted only nine passes in a disjointed first half, but he led touchdown drives on consecutive possessions to end the game, which Williams concluded with passing scores of six and 46 yards. He was able to hit on big plays throughout the contest, as his five completions of at least 20 yards matched his season high and led to his highest yardage total as a passer since Week 9. Williams has also recorded multiple touchdowns through the air in four of his last five games after doing so only three times in his first 10 contests.
</div>

### 🔴 Jayden Reed (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Reed wasn't consistently involved throughout, and he exited the game for a spell in the second half to be evaluated for an undisclosed injury, per Rob Demovsky of ESPN.com. Jordan Love's exit from the contest in the second quarter due to a concussion likely didn't help matters, although Reed hauled in a 31-yard pass from  Malik Willis in overtime for the majority of his production. Reed will aim to bounce back with a more productive showing at the expense of the Ravens secondary in a Week 17 home matchup next Saturday night.
</div>

### 🟢 Travis Kelce (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> With Patrick Mahomes (knee) lost for the season and Gardner Minshew (knee) not even making it to halftime before going down as well, Kelce was left with third-string QB Chris Oladokun under center, and the duo showed very little chemistry en route to the veteran tight end's worst numbers of 2025. Minshew may have suffered a torn ACL, so a week of first-team reps together could improve that connection, but Kelce -- along with the rest of the Kansas City passing attack -- will be a very shaky fantasy option in Week 17 against the Broncos.
</div>

### 🟢 Hunter Henry (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Henry made his mark on Sunday Night Football in the fourth quarter when he slipped behind the coverage for a short touchdown grab in the back corner of the end zone. The veteran tight end was held to one catch when the Patriots came out of the bye in Week 15, so fantasy managers were pleased to see a return to form against Baltimore. Henry currently sits 11 yards shy of the career-high mark of 674 receiving yards he posted in 2024. Next Sunday's matchup versus the Jets presents a golden opportunity for Henry to reach that personal milestone in Week 17.
</div>

### 🟢 Chris Olave (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Olave caught a 23-yard touchdown pass from Tyler Shough in the third quarter and a 38-yard touchdown pass from Taysom Hill in the fourth quarter. New Orleans' No. 1 receiver set season highs in targets and receiving yards as the Saints extended their winning streak to three games. Olave has scored five touchdowns in his last six games while showing promising chemistry with Shough heading into another favorable matchup in Week 17 against the Titans.
</div>

### 🟢 DeVonta Smith (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Smith got off to a fast start, logging three receptions for 27 yards and a touchdown in the first 13 minutes of game time. He found the end zone from five yards away to tally his first score since Week 10. A.J. Brown was otherwise the primary driver of the Eagles' passing game, and Smith has now been held to 50 receiving yards or fewer in five of his last six games.
</div>

### 🟢 Jalen Hurts (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Hurts had an accurate game as a passer, but he worked primarily in short and intermediate areas of the field. Nevertheless, he managed a 24-yard completion to A.J. Brown and also tallied touchdown passes from five and 15 yards away. Hurts also showed some aggression on the ground, logging his highest rushing total since Week 4. He'll draw a tough Week 17 matchup against the Bills, though he has gotten back on track in recent weeks by tallying multiple scores in four of his last five matchups.
</div>

### 🟢 Will Shipley (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Eagles went up by 31 points on the first play of the fourth quarter, a situation which usually leads to some garbage-time touches for running backs lower on the depth chart. In this case, those all went to Tank Bigsby, who had 27 offensive snaps to Shipley's three and 17 carries to Shipley's zero.
</div>

### 🟢 DK Metcalf (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Suspension<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Per Adam Schefter of ESPN, Metcalf plans to appeal the suspension, but at this stage the wideout is slated to miss the Steelers' final two regular-season contests and would be eligible to return for the playoffs, should the team qualify. In Metcalf's looming absence, fellow WRs Calvin Austin (hamstring), Adam Thielen and Marquez Valdes-Scantling figure to see added opportunities, with TEs Darnell Washington, Pat Freiermuth and Jonnu Smith also candidates to absorb some of the targets that would otherwise go Metcalf's way.
</div>

### 🟢 Christian McCaffrey (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> McCaffrey and the Colts' Jonathan Taylor headlined a matchup featuring two of the league's top running backs on Monday Night Football. CMC got the better of Taylor (16-46-1) despite facing the stiffer of the two defenses, doubling the latter's yards from scrimmage and scoring output in a winning effort. McCaffrey pushed his rushing total over the 1,000-yard mark for the season while sitting 151 yards shy of doing the same as a receiver with two games left in the regular season. With the 49ers having a potential path to the No. 1 seed in the NFC, fantasy managers can expect the team to lean heavily on McCaffrey against the Bears in Week 17, especially if star TE George Kittle (ankle) is unable to suit up.
</div>

### 🟢 Rachaad White (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> White finished with 9.0 yards per carry thanks almost exclusively to a 39-yard run he rattled off early in the second quarter. The versatile veteran back has averaged 4.8 yards per carry or more in five of the last six games, but he has logged double-digit totes just twice in that span while Bucky Irving continues to serve as the clear leader of the ground attack. White should continue in a similar change-of-pace role in a Week 17 road matchup against the Dolphins next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Elic Ayomanor (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> While the production was modest, Ayomanor led the Titans in receiving yards while catching more than two passes for the first time since Week 9. With Cam Ward beginning to assert himself, the Tennessee passing attack has a little more upside than it did to begin the season, but Ayomanor's 34-428-3 line on 72 targets over 14 games won't make him an appealing fantasy option in Week 17 against the Saints.
