## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Tyler Allgeier (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The backup RB scored one-yard TDs in the first and fourth quarters as he continues to take red-zone work away from Bijan Robinson. Robinson led the Falcons with 84 rushing yards on the day but didn't get into the end zone, and he has only two rushing touchdowns in nine games compared to Allgeier's six. It was also Allgeier's first multi-TD performance since Week 1 of the 2023 season. as long as he continues to see heavy usage in the red zone and at the goal line, Allgeier will have some fantasy utility even though Sunday was only the third time this season he's topped 50 rushing yards in a game.
</div>

### 🟢 David Njoku (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Njoku's nine-yard touchdown catch in the first quarter was his third touchdown in Njoku's last four games. He remains a touchdown-dependent fantasy option due to the emergence of rookie tight end Harold Fannin (hamstring), who had four catches for 44 yards Sunday. Up next for Njoku and the Browns is a Week 11 home game against the Ravens.
</div>

### 🟢 Evan Engram (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Engram has secured only two of eight targets over the past two games. This downturn comes after a stretch of five consecutive games with at least four catches. Engram's next opportunity to get back on track will come Nov. 16 against the Chiefs.
</div>

### 🟢 Troy Franklin (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Franklin was the only Broncos player to get into the end zone Thursday, making a tough seven-yard touchdown grab late in the first half. The second-year wideout also led Denver in receptions and targets, and his recent ascension in the passing offense has been impossible to ignore -- Franklin has 37 targets over the last four games alone. The Oregon product should be busy again in Week 11, as the Chiefs pay the Broncos a visit on Sunday, Nov. 16 for a critical divisional showdown.
</div>

### 🟡 Brian Thomas Jr. (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟡 Isiah Pacheco (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 Rashee Rice (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Rice extended his scoring streak to three games since returning from suspension in Week 7. The 25-year-old used his legs to hit pay dirt this time around after hauling in three touchdown receptions over his previous two contests. While the Chiefs were unable to claim victory over an AFC rival Sunday, Rice continued establishing himself as QB Patrick Mahomes' favorite weapon by finishing two targets ahead of Travis Kelce (4-66-0). Fantasy managers will be forced to fill Rice's WR1 production with Kansas City on a bye in Week 10. The red-hot wideout will resume play against the Broncos on Nov. 16.
</div>

### 🟢 Tyler Lockett (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Playing in only his second game as a Raider, Lockett and Geno Smith reignited their well-established connection from their time in Seattle during the narrow loss. Lockett led the Raiders in receptions, receiving yards and targets on the night with figures that were also season highs. Whether Lockett's enhanced role in Las Vegas' first game without the traded Jakobi Meyers has any staying power remains to be seen, but he'll have a matchup conducive to carrying over the momentum when the Cowboys pay a visit to Las Vegas on Monday night, Nov. 17 for a Week 11 interconference clash.
</div>

### 🟢 Ladd McConkey (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> McConkey paced the Chargers with a season-high 107 yards receiving and his fourth touchdown reception on the year. The stellar sophomore nearly ripped off a second score when he scampered down the sidelines for a game-high 58-yard reception before being tracked down by Jalen Ramsey in the red zone. After a bit of a slow start to the campaign, McConkey has caught fire midseason en route to a 51-631-4 receiving line through 10 starts. Expect the elite slot receiver to remain a featured cog on offense against the Jaguars next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 De'Von Achane (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Achane was a central figure in the Dolphins' jaw-dropping upset victory, spearheading the offense with 59- and 35-yard touchdown runs on his way to a season-high tally on the ground. The versatile third-year back also notched a second straight six-catch effort, and he's recorded at least 67 rushing yards in five consecutive contests after a season-low 16-yard effort versus the Panthers in Week 5. Achane remains a must-start option in all formats heading into the Week 11 matchup against the Commanders in Madrid next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Darius Slayton (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Two weeks prior to the 11th anniversary of Odell Beckham's iconic one-handed catch, Slayton put on his best Beckham impression with a one-handed 31-yard catch on the final play of the first quarter. Slayton followed that up with a 38-yard catch immediately on the other side of the break. He led the Giants in receiving yards Sunday despite exiting briefly to have his hamstring checked out, but all of Slayton's production came before Jaxson Dart was knocked out of the game in the second half due to a concussion. If Dart isn't cleared to face the Packers in Week 11, Slayton would be hard to trust in fantasy despite his role as the top downfield option among Giants wide receivers.
</div>

### 🟢 Wan'Dale Robinson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Robinson led the Giants in targets, but both Darius Slayton (89) and Theo Johnson (75) produced more receiving yards. Whether the Giants start Jaxson Dart (concussion) or Russell Wilson at quarterback in Week 11 against the Packers, Robinson should continue to fill his usual role as a shifty outlet for short passes. Wilson replaced Dart after the rookie sustained a concussion in the second half against the Bears.
</div>

### 🟢 Aaron Rodgers (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Steelers had minimal success moving the ball at any point when the outcome was in doubt, and Rodgers made several uncharacteristic mistakes. He took a safety midway through the first quarter and then overthrew his intended targets several times, including an interception late in the second quarter that led to a touchdown for the Chargers. Rodgers managed to lead a garbage-time drive late in the fourth quarter to rack up 64 yards and a touchdown to pad his stat line, but he has now averaged 6.1 yards per attempt or fewer in three straight games.
</div>

### 🟢 Baker Mayfield (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Mayfield's final numbers were certainly appealing from a fantasy perspective, although some of the yardage came on a last-ditch drive that he capped off with his final touchdown pass of the day, an 11-yard strike to Tez Johnson. That play was preceded by 21- and 10-yard TDs to Emeka Egbuka and Johnson, respectively, giving Mayfield his first three-touchdown-pass tally since Week 1. The veteran signal-caller's numbers were all the more impressive considering the ongoing absences of Mike Evans (IR, collarbone/concussion), Chris Godwin (fibula) and Bucky Irving (shoulder/foot), and he figures to once again shoulder a heavy workload through the air when the Buccaneers face the Bills on the road in Week 11.
</div>

### 🟢 Jayden Daniels (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Out<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
