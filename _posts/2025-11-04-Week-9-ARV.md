## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Bijan Robinson (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Robinson didn't get many opportunities on the ground as the Falcons tried to play catch-up with a pass-heavy approach, but he was heavily involved as a receiver out of the backfield. Drake London scored all three of Atlanta's touchdowns while leading the team with nine catches and 118 receiving yards, but all other Falcons pass catchers besides London and Robinson combined for only five receptions and 53 yards. Robinson's versatile skill set should ensure he maintains a prominent role in Week 10 against the Colts in Berlin as he tries to snap a two-game touchdown drought.
</div>

### 🟢 Xavier Legette (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Legette was evaluated for a possible concussion after taking a hit to the head in the second quarter, but he later returned and finished with 31 offensive snaps. Since posting a 9-92-1 receiving line against the Jets in Week 7, the second-year wideout has been quiet, recording just three catches for 39 yards over Carolina's last two contests. However, his lack of production in Week 9 can likely be attributed to the poor weather conditions and quarterback Bryce Young attempting only 20 passes and throwing for just 102 yards. Legette will look to bounce back in a Week 10 divisional matchup against the Saints.
</div>

### 🟢 Colston Loveland (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The rookie put a thrilling cap on the wildest fourth quarter of the season, recording a 58-yard catch-and-run touchdown during which he bounced off a would-be tackler in the middle of the field and sprinted into the end zone with 17 seconds remaining. Loveland preceded that memorable play with a five-yard scoring grab in the first half of the third quarter, and the two catches served as the 2025 first-round pick's first pair of NFL touchdowns. Loveland's career-high reception, yardage and target totals were partly the result of Cole Kmet exiting the game with a concussion in the second quarter, but the former is clearly earning the right to more playing time by the week.
</div>

### 🟢 Jaydon Blue (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong>

### 🟢 Kalif Raymond (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Raymond's role on Detroit's offense has diminished since the beginning of the season, as he's caught just three of four targets for 17 yards over the team's last four contests. He was relatively ineffective as a kick returner in Week 9 as well, tallying only 15 yards across two returns. Despite this underwhelming stretch, the veteran wideout from Holy Cross is expected to remain the Lions' No. 3 receiver and top kick returner heading into the Week 10 matchup against the Commanders.
</div>

### 🟢 Parker Washington (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Washington led the Jaguars in receiving Sunday with Travis Hunter (knee) being placed on injured reserve this week. It also helped that starter Brian Thomas (ankle) left the contest late in the fourth quarter, but most of Washington's production came with Thomas still active. Expect the 23-year-old to continue seeing extended run for as long as Hunter remains out. Washington's value could inflate further if Thomas is also unable to suit up against the Texans next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Brashard Smith (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Smith failed to capitalize on the absence of Isiah Pacheco (knee), finishing the loss with just three total touches. Kareem Hunt (11-49-1) finished as Kansas City's only fantasy-relevant back Sunday. With a bye week upcoming, Smith could find himself back in the No. 3 spot on the depth chart if Pacheco is ready to return for a Nov. 16 matchup against the Broncos.
</div>

### 🟢 Geno Smith (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Smith rebounded nicely from a historically poor performance against the Chiefs (67 passing yards, no touchdowns) in the Raiders' last appearance. The 34-year-old welcomed Brock Bowers (knee) back with open arms Sunday, hooking up in the end zone with his talented tight end on three separate occasions. The four passing touchdowns set a new single-game high for Smith since joining the silver and black this past offseason. It's been a true boom-or-bust situation for the veteran signal-caller in Las Vegas, as he has now finished with less than 200 passing yards in half of his eight starts. Managers should be wary of trusting Smith on a short week in a tough matchup against Denver on Thursday Night Football in Week 10.
</div>

### 🟡 Puka Nacua (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> McVay's comments essentially echo what he said following Sunday's win, when he suggested that Nacua could have returned to the contest after exiting in the third quarter but ultimately remained on the sideline for the rest of the game while the Rams were sitting on a comfortable lead. Nacua's scan appears to be precautionary in nature, though even if the results reveal nothing concerning, the star receiver's practice participation could still be affected leading up to next Sunday's game at San Francisco.
</div>

### 🟢 Kyren Williams (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Williams took advantage of a positive game script to log season-high marks in carries and yards, highlighted by his first time reaching 100 yards on the ground across eight contests. His longest rush of the day went for 15 yards, and he still has only one gain of at least 20 yards on 132 attempts for the campaign. Nevertheless, Williams had his most productive fantasy performance, which was helped by a touchdown plunge early in the fourth quarter. He should continue to serve as the Rams' lead back, though he remains reliant primarily on volume to turn in strong fantasy performances.
</div>

### 🟢 Tank Bigsby (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Saquon Barkley left early in the fourth quarter with a groin injury, and Bigsby did most of his damage as the Eagles put the game to bed. It was still a very impressive performance from the former Jaguar, who came into the afternoon with just 23 rushing yards on the season between Jacksonville and Philly while being primarily used as a kickoff returner. The Eagles get a well-timed Week 9 bye, so Barkley may not miss any further action, but if he's not ready to return for a Week 10 clash with the Packers, Bigsby could find himself handling a very significant role in the offense.
</div>

### 🟢 Cade Otton (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Otton finished second in receiving production for the Buccaneers on a low-volume passing day. After a slow start to the campaign, the veteran tight end has picked things up with averages of 5.0 receptions and 59.3 yards over his last four appearances. Otton should continue seeing elevated usage out of Tampa Bay's upcoming bye week for a team dealing with multiple injuries at the receiver position.
</div>

### 🟢 Emeka Egbuka (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Egbuka did not carry an injury designation in Week 8, but the final results suggest that he is still isn't playing at 100 percent. The talented rookie finished with a catch rate below 50 percent for the second week in a row, the only two times he has fallen below that mark this season. Fortunately for fantasy managers, Egbuka will get an extra week of recovery for his nagging hamstring with Tampa Bay on bye in Week 9. A refreshed Egbuka will look to get back on track when the Buccaneers host the Patriots on Nov. 9.
</div>

### 🔴 Calvin Ridley (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Out<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> out
</div>

### 🟢 Deebo Samuel (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> No Commanders offensive skill-position player had a particularly strong showing in Sunday night's loss, though Samuel did lead the team in both targets and receptions. His most significant contribution was a 19-yard gain that came primarily after the catch late in the third quarter. Samuel may still be slowed by a heel injury, having logged three straight games with 45 yards from scrimmage or fewer. His chance of turning things around moving forward is also complicated by the likely absence of Jayden Daniels (arm).
