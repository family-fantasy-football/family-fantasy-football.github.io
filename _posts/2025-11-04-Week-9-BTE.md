## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 DJ Moore (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Moore has 145 receiving yards over his last two contests (72 this game and 73 last week) after failing to reach 60 yards in any of his previous five. He's working his way back into weekly WR3 territory with multi-phase involvement boosting his opportunities.
</div>

### 🟢 Tee Higgins (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Higgins was the star of the first three quarters for the Bengals, making a picturesque contested 44-yard touchdown grab along the left sideline with under two minutes remaining in the first half before tacking on a two-yard scoring catch with just over five minutes left in the third quarter. Higgins added his two-point conversion reception following a Noah Fant 23-yard TD catch with under two minutes remaining, and the former has now visited the end zone four times in the last three games. Higgins also has at least 62 receiving yards in three of the last four contests, affording him plenty of momentum going into Cincinnati's Week 10 bye.
</div>

### 🟢 Joe Flacco (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Listed as questionable coming in due to a shoulder injury, Flacco ironically finished the offensive showcase with a career-high passing yardage total that comfortably exceeded his previous best of 389. The veteran quarterback got it done with plenty of efficiency while averaging 10.0 yards per attempt and facilitating 100-yard performances for top wideouts Tee Higgins, who also caught two of Flacco's touchdowns, and Ja'Marr Chase. Flacco appeared to have authored a miraculous comeback with his two final scoring tosses of the day to Noah Fant (23 yards) and Andrei Iosivas (nine yards), but Chicago answered with a 58-yard touchdown by Colston Loveland to escape with the victory. Despite the disappointing outcome Sunday, Flacco has provided a significant spark for Cincinnati's air attack and already has a pair of 300-yard efforts in the four games he's started heading into a Week 11 road matchup against the Steelers on Sunday, Nov. 16 following the Week 10 bye.
</div>

### 🟡 C.J. Stroud (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Prior to exiting the contest, Stroud had completed six of his 10 pass attempts for 79 yards and carried twice for 12 yards. In his absence, Davis Mills is in at quarterback for the Texans.
</div>

### 🟢 J.J. McCarthy (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The second-year signal-caller made his return from a five-game absence and delivered a significant upset in a difficult road environment. McCarthy's final stat line wasn't exactly scintillating, yet it was still fantasy-friendly thanks to his 10- and seven-yard touchdown passes to Justin Jefferson and T.J. Hockenson in the first half, as well as his own nine-yard rush with just over six minutes remaining in the third quarter. McCarthy flashed encouraging chemistry with both Jefferson and Jordan Addison, and he'll head into a Week 10 home showdown against the Ravens with plenty of momentum.
</div>

### 🟢 Juwan Johnson (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Johnson hauled in the lone passing touchdown from rookie quarterback Tyler Shough, who made his first career start for the Saints. This was the tight end's first touchdown since Week 2, and he tied with Chris Olave for the team's second-most targets behind WR2 Rashid Shaheed (nine). New Orleans' offense has been one of the worst-performing units in the NFL this season, but Johnson is on pace for the most productive campaign of his six-year career. Through nine games, he is just 11 catches and 149 receiving yards shy of his career-best marks from last year. The Saints next face the divisional-rival Panthers in Week 10 next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Devin Singletary (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Singletary outplayed Tyrone Tracy in the first game after Cam Skattebo's season-ending ankle injury. Tracy turned five carries and four targets into 37 scrimmage yards. The Giants' only rushing touchdown of the game was scored by Jaxson Dart, who also led the team with 56 rushing yards. The rookie quarterback will likely remain involved in the rushing attack against the Bears in Week 10, but Singletary and Tracy both look poised to maintain significant roles while splitting carries in the aftermath of Cam Skattebo's season-ending ankle injury.
</div>

### 🟢 Breece Hall (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Hall scored his first touchdown of the season on a five-yard run early in the fourth quarter, then doubled that total with a 27-yard touchdown run that featured some impressive footwork to stay inbounds along the sideline. He capped the improbable fourth-quarter comeback with a four-yard touchdown pass to Mason Taylor, as the ensuing PAT gave the Jets their first lead of the game with 1:54 remaining before the defense closed the door. Hall will have a Week 9 bye to help his recovery from a knee injury that limited his practice participation and had him listed as questionable heading into Sunday's win, and he should reprise his role as the team's top backfield option in Week 10 against the Browns.
</div>

### 🟢 Dallas Goedert (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> While he didn't see much volume, Goedert celebrated National Tight End Day in style with a six-yard TD in the second quarter and a 17-yard score in the fourth. The veteran TE may be disappointed he won't get to play the Giants again in 2025 after racking up 12 catches on 14 targets for 138 yards and three touchdowns against them in two meetings. Goedert rolls into the Eagles' Week 9 bye with an overall 30-289-7 line on 39 targets through seven contests.
</div>

### 🟢 Roman Wilson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Wilson was the Steelers' leading receiver against Green Bay in Week 8 with a season-high 74 yards and a touchdown, but he was held in check a week later. He was held to single-digit yards for the first time since Week 4 while playing 47 percent of the team's offensive snaps, which ranked third among Pittsburgh's wide receivers. Wilson showcased his upside Week 8, but he remains an unreliable fantasy option heading into the second half of the year, and it's possible that the Steelers target a wide receiver ahead of the trade deadline.
</div>

### 🟢 Calvin Austin III (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Austin led the Steelers' pass catchers in receptions and yards while tying Darnell Washington in targets. As is typically the case, he was targeted in short areas of the field, though he did manage gains of 18 and 14 yards primarily on yards after the catch. Austin is a key part of Pittsburgh's passing game, though he's reached 30 yards in only half of his six games, minimizing his fantasy impact.
</div>

### 🟢 Kendrick Bourne (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Bourne's two targets tied for fourth on the team as Mac Jones didn't target any player more than six times. After back-to-back 142-yard receiving performances in Weeks 5 and 6, Bourne has just seven catches for 92 yards across three subsequent games. Even if San Francisco doesn't get any healthier at wide receiver in Week 10 against the Rams, Bourne may not see a significant target share.
</div>

### 🟢 Zach Charbonnet (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Charbonnet failed to replicate the magic from last week's primetime two-score performance, finishing with 46 total yards and no trips to the end zone on Sunday Night Football. The talented backup has become somewhat touchdown-dependent in fantasy this year, failing to top 49 rushing yards in any of his seven appearances with minimal involvement in the passing game this season. Starter Kenneth Walker is the stabler fantasy option out of Seattle's two-pronged backfield, but Charbonnet could still provide value for those in deeper formats in a soft matchup against Arizona next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Kenneth Walker III (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> QB Sam Darnold and Seattle's passing attack stole the show on Sunday Night Football, accounting for 330 of the team's 418 net yards of offense and four of its five touchdowns against Washington. Walker still led the Seahawks' backfield in carries and production, out-touching Zach Charbonnet by four in the comfortable win. The 24-year-old Walker checks in as Seattle's leading rusher as we cross the midpoint of the regular season, recording 472 yards (4.5 YPC) and three touchdowns across eight games. Walker will be hungry for his fourth score against the Cardinals next Sunday after punching in all three of his touchdowns in Weeks 1 through 3.
</div>

### 🟡 Terry McLaurin (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 Chris Moore (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Despite playing the most snaps of any Commanders wideout during Sunday's blowout loss, Moore was held without a catch for the second consecutive game. The veteran from Cincinnati has now appeared in eight contests this season, tallying eight receptions for 164 yards and a touchdown over 246 offensive snaps. Although he will likely continue to see the field due to Terry McLaurin (quadriceps) and Noah Brown (groin) both being sidelined, Moore doesn't carry much fantasy value heading into the Week 10 matchup against the Lions.
