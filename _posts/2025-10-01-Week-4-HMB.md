## Player Report

#### Zay Flowers (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Flowers made some big plays early, tallying catches of 21 and 17 yards on Baltimore's first two possessions. The entire offense struggled after Lamar Jackson (hamstring) left the game late in the third quarter, but the wideout was able to pad his stats in garbage time with Cooper Rush targeting him five times on a drive early in the final quarter, which Flowers turned into four catches for 21 yards. While the Ravens are typically known for their run game, the passing attack has been the key to their offensive success so far this season, so Jackson's health ahead of a Week 5 clash with the Texans could have a big impact on Flowers' floor and ceiling.
#### Derrick Henry (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** The Ravens attempted only 17 rushes as a team, with Lamar Jackson accounting for six of those before he exited with a hamstring injury. That left Henry with limited volume, with four rushes in each half. He performed efficiently enough by gaining double-digit yards on two carries and one reception, but the game script ultimately held him back. Henry has had a poor start to the season with three lost fumbles in high-profile situations, and he's now been held to 50 or fewer rushing yards in three consecutive games for the first time since 2018.
#### Josh Allen (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** The Bills got more than they bargained for from the visiting Saints, but Allen still finished with his lowest pass-attempt total of the campaign. The reigning NFL MVP did put those throws to good use, tossing multiple touchdowns for the third time in four games by connecting with Khalil Shakir and Dalton Kincaid for scoring passes of 43 and 28 yards, respectively. Allen also took it in himself from five yards out just after the halfway point of the third quarter, already his third rush TD of the season. Allen takes an impressive 70.2 percent completion rate and 7:1 TD:INT into a Week 5 divisional home clash against the Patriots next Sunday night.
#### Sam LaPorta (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** LaPorta remained a top priority in the Detroit offense -- he finished third on the team in targets behind only Amon-Ra St. Brown (seven) and Jameson Williams (eight) -- but he turned in another underwhelming performance. Despite logging a reception of 27 yards just before halftime, he now has less than 40 receiving yards in three of four games this season. LaPorta has also yet to score, with St. Brown and Jahmyr Gibbs instead dominating touches near the end zone.
#### Amon-Ra St. Brown (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** St. Brown was the only Detroit pass catcher to post a notable line in Sunday's blowout win, accounting for seven of Jared Goff's 16 completions. He helped set up the team's first touchdown of the day with a 25-yard catch before turning in a pair of his own scores from two and eight yards away. St. Brown now has six touchdowns across four games while recording at least 70 receiving yards in each of his last three contests.
#### Tucker Kraft (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Kraft was one of four Packers pass catchers to record at least 50 yards, and he finished third on the team in targets. His biggest impact came on Green Bay's opening possession, when he recorded two receptions for 22 yards and was tackled just short of the goal line. Kraft has at least four targets in all four games this season and has at least 50 receiving yards or a touchdown in three of four contests.
#### Jordan Love (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Love has been efficient all season, and that didn't change Sunday night as he averaged 7.8 yards per attempt while completing four passes of more than 20 yards. The Packers were also pushed offensively by Dak Prescott and the Cowboys, with Love attempting at least 40 passes for only the sixth time in a regular-season contest in his career. Love targeted seven pass catchers at least three times, though he connected with Romeo Doubs for all three of his touchdowns and hit Matthew Golden for a 46-yard gain -- his longest of the night. Love has had mediocre fantasy results to begin the season, but he has multiple touchdown passes in three of four contests while topping 250 passing yards twice.
#### JuJu Smith-Schuster (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The veteran wideout's workload is set to decline in a couple weeks when Rashee Rice returns from his six-game suspension, but Smith-Schuster continues to play a key role in the offense for KC in the meantime, as he led the wideout room with 57 offensive snaps (78 percent) in Week 4. Sunday's effort marked the first time he's reached double-digit PPR points this season, and he'll likely remain a touchdown-dependent fantasy option while in a prominent role. That said, he has a decent matchup ahead versus the Jaguars in Week 5.
#### Kareem Hunt (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Hunt had split the rushing workload almost exactly evenly with Isiah Pacheco through the first three games of the season, and while the veteran saw 14 touches compared to Pacheco's nine Sunday, their snap count was nearly even (32 for Hunt to 27 for Pacheco). However, Hunt had a poor day by averaging only 2.6 yards per carry, with a long gain of seven yards. He appears to have the trust of the coaching staff, which could insulate his role, but he has yet to reach 35 rushing yards in a game this season.
#### Keenan Allen (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** The veteran wideout failed to haul in at least 60 yards for the first time this season and saw his TD streak end at three games, but Allen still racked up at least five receptions for the fourth straight week to begin his reunion with the Chargers. He'll take a 24-231-3 line on 35 targets into Week 5's clash with a vulnerable Commanders secondary.
#### Blake Corum (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Kyren Williams handled the bulk of backfield touches for Los Angeles as per usual, finishing with 94 yards from scrimmage on 16 touches. Corum still saw strong touch volume, but he failed to produce much with his opportunities. The nine carries marked a new high for the Michigan product through four games in 2025, but Corum doesn't provide enough upside in his current backup role to warrant starting consideration against the 49ers on Thursday.
#### Kenneth Gainwell (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Jaylen Warren (knee) was surprisingly inactive Sunday morning, leaving Gainwell to fill in as Pittsburgh's lead back. He did so admirably, scoring touchdowns from one and four yards away while also ripping off long gains of 15 and 10 yards. Gainwell also remained active as a pass catcher, giving him a well-rounded fantasy line. The Steelers are headed into their bye week, meaning this may be Gainwell's only chance to handle this type of workload for the time being, but he proved plenty capable of handling the lead-back role if needed.
#### Sterling Shepard (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** The veteran wideout continued to operate the No. 3 receiver, as Chris Godwin's season debut was offset by Mike Evans' absence due to a hamstring injury. Shepard saw a significant downturn from his season-high 80-yard output in Week 3, but given his chemistry with Baker Mayfield, he could be more productive in a Week 5 road matchup against the Seahawks.
#### Cam Ward (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Ward continues to look overwhelmed during his rookie season, as he was unable to lead the Titans on a scoring drive while averaging an abysmal 4.2 yards per attempt in Sunday's blowout loss. He did manage multiple completions of at least 20 yards for the third consecutive game, but Ward has only two touchdowns with four turnovers across his first four games as a pro. It's too early to make any conclusions about Ward's ability as a pro, but it has not been a good start to his career.
#### Jacory Croskey-Merritt (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** The rookie running back led the Commanders' backfield in touches on the day with nine, but Chris Rodriguez paced the team in rushing yards, turning seven totes into 59 yards, while Deebo Samuel got three carries in addition to his receiving work and Jeremy McNichols also chipped in with three touches. The overall effectiveness of the arrangement -- 6.7 yards per carry for Washington's backfield as a whole -- was impressive once again, but none of the team's RBs will be reliable fantasy plays without a consistent path to more volume. Croskey-Merritt will try to make an impact with what touches he gets in Week 5 against the Chargers.
