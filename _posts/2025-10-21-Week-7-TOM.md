## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Bam Knight (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The former Jet and Lion led the Cardinals in rushing yards as he got 17 touches to Michael Carter's nine, although neither back got into the end zone. The Cardinals get a Week 8 bye, but Knight will have at least one more game in a prominent backfield role in Week 9 against the Cowboys, with Trey Benson (knee) required to miss one more game before being eligible to come off IR. Over the three games Benson has missed so far, Knight has collected 142 scrimmage yards and two rushing TDs.
</div>

### 🟢 Marvin Harrison Jr. (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Harrison came out of a Week 6 loss in Indianapolis with a concussion that limited him at Wednesday's walkthrough and Thursday's practice, but his ability to handle every practice rep Friday followed by avoiding a Week 7 designation indicates he's been cleared by an independent neurologist. QB Kyler Murray (foot) is listed as questionable for Sunday's contest after being listed as limited all week, but Jacoby Brissett took all the visible reps with the first-team offense, suggesting the latter is more likely than the former to be tossing passes Harrison's way this weekend.
</div>

### 🟡 Dalton Kincaid (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 James Cook III (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Cook enjoyed a solid night on the ground despite game script working against the run as the game unfolded, bouncing back nicely from a 49-yard showing in the Week 5 loss to the Patriots. However, he failed to draw a target for the first time this season after not hauling in the one pass thrown his way Week 5, a relatively rare slump for him as a pass catcher. Cook's fantasy value remains significantly elevated in all formats, however, and he draws a favorable matchup on the road against the Panthers on Sunday, Oct. 26 following Buffalo's Week 7 bye.
</div>

### 🟢 J.K. Dobbins (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Dobbins responded well from his worst outing of the season against the Jets last week (14-40-0), averaging 5.8 yards a carry while leading his team in rushing against the Giants. The veteran starter was held out of the end zone in consecutive games for the first time this season, which is the only negative takeaway from Sunday's win. Backup RJ Harvey poached a receiving touchdown on his only reception, but he generated zero rushing yards on four attempts as the Broncos backfield continues to belong to Dobbins. The Ohio State product checks in as a safe starting option in fantasy for Week 8 in a soft matchup against the Cowboys next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Jared Goff (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Goff was able to lead his team to victory on Monday Night Football, but it came at the expense of his first multi-turnover game of the season. It also was the veteran signal-caller's third time scoring one touchdown or less this year. Goff has thrown 12 touchdowns to just one interception in his four other starts, so his whole body of work has been positive as Detroit enters its Week 8 bye. The 30-year-old should continue to be treated as a starting-level option in fantasy when the Lions host the Vikings on Sunday, Nov. 2.
</div>

### 🟢 Romeo Doubs (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> While Tucker Kraft led the Packers with 10 targets and was on the other end of Jordan Love's only TD pass, it was Doubs who paced the team in catches and receiving yards. The fourth-year wideout has caught at least five passes in three straight games as he shines in the absence of Jayden Reed (collarbone), posting a 17-185-3 line on 25 targets during that stretch. Doubs will look to keep rolling in Week 8 against the Steelers.
</div>

### 🟢 Matthew Golden (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Packers' offense didn't really wake up until the second half, and Golden wasn't able to do as much with his limited volume as he had in Week 6 against the Bengals. The rookie wideout has yet to see more than six targets in a game in the pros, and he's still looking for his first TD in the NFL. Golden will take a modest 18-249-0 line on 23 targets through six contests into a Week 8 meeting with the Steelers.
</div>

### 🟢 Tyler Warren (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The rookie tight end saw modest target volume, but he finished second in receiving yards on the Colts behind Alec Pierce and hit paydirt for a fourth straight week (the first one being a rushing touchdown) when he connected with Daniel Jones for a five-yard score in the second quarter. Warren has quickly become a key part of a dominant offense, posting a 33-439-3 line on 45 targets through his first seven NFL games. He'll look to make another visit to the end zone in Week 8 against a Titans defense that held him to a 3-38-0 line in their first meeting back in Week 3.
</div>

### 🟢 Travis Hunter (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The rookie two-way player hauled in his first career touchdown on a 34-yard toss from Trevor Lawrence with 9:06 remaining in the fourth quarter. Hunter set new personal bests in catches, yards and targets in the performance, and his volume increase came as Brian Thomas (shoulder) and Dyami Brown (leg) checked in and out of the lineup in the second half. The Jaguars will be on bye in Week 8, but if Thomas' injury proves to be serious, Hunter could be headed for significantly elevated volume in the second half.
</div>

### 🟢 Ashton Jeanty (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Raiders had arguably the worst offensive showing by a team this season, running only 30 offensive plays for 95 net yards. That didn't offer Jeanty any opportunity to get going, though he did still account for one of the team's more explosive plays with a 13-yard  catch and run late in the third quarter. It was a disappointing time for Jeanty to turn in the lowest yardage total of his career, as he had topped 100 yards from scrimmage in two of his last three contests.
</div>

### 🟢 Kayshon Boutte (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Boutte saw only two targets, his lowest total since Week 2. However, he still managed to turn in a productive effort thanks primarily to a 39-yard touchdown just before halftime to give the Patriots a lead they wouldn't concede. Boutte has now found the end zone in consecutive games, also logging his second- and third-best yardage totals of the season in those contests.
</div>

### 🟢 Jaxson Dart (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> It was a crushing loss for the Giants, considering Dart pushed his fourth touchdown of the contest across the goal line with 40 seconds left in regulation, only to watch a missed extra-point attempt open the door for the Broncos to come back and win it with a field goal as time expired. The rookie signal-caller finished with his worst completion percentage (45.5) as a pro, but he offset the inefficiency with new highs in passing yards (283) and total touchdowns (four). Dart's fourth and final trip to the end zone came as a rusher, which helped offset a season-low five rush attempts Sunday. The Ole Miss product will attempt to overcome another tough defensive matchup when the Giants visit the Eagles next Sunday. Dart generated 23.6 standard fantasy points when these two teams met in New York back in Week 6.
</div>

### 🟢 Jake Tonges (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> George Kittle (hamstring) was activated from injured reserve for Sunday's contest, which pushed Tonges back down to third on the tight end depth chart. Luke Farrell (33 percent) finished second in playing time behind Kittle (81 percent), as it appears that the coaching staff prefers the former's blocking in the No. 2 role over Tonges' play-making ability. Tonges did an admirable job filling in for Kittle, producing a 25-224-3 receiving line in five-plus games played. Fantasy managers can safely move on from Tonges in Week 8, but he is a name to remember for any games Kittle might miss in the future.
</div>

### 🟢 Mac Jones (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jones was asked to play the role of game manager Sunday, and he did just that, keeping drives alive for Christian McCaffrey to feast on Atlanta's defense for 200-plus yards and two touchdowns. The veteran backup threw an interception for the second week in a row and failed to record a touchdown in as many games. Jones has been a godsend for the 5-2 49ers, but the luster has worn off from a fantasy perspective following a hot start filling in for Brock Purdy (toe). The latter resumed practicing this week, so it wouldn't be shocking to see Jones resume his backup role against the Texans next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Chig Okonkwo (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Okonkwo maintained his typical allotment of snaps, as he was on the field for 61 percent of offensive plays. However, his role as a pass catcher was diminished relative to Gunnar Helm, who was the far superior receiver in the loss. Okonkwo has at least four catches in four of seven games this season, so this performance was likely an anamoly.
