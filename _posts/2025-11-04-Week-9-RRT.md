## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Trey McBride (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> McBride found himself back in the end zone just two weeks after setting a new career high in touchdowns with a multi-score effort against the Packers. The PPR monster had historically struggled in the red zone over the first three years of his career, but he has addressed that deficiency by hitting pay dirt four times in his last three appearances. McBride entered rare air with Monday's stat line, joining current and former legends Travis Kelce and Tony Gonzalez as the only tight ends in NFL history to record at least five catches in 10 consecutive games. The 25-year-old McBride will attempt to carry over his red-hot play into Sunday's division matchup against the Seahawks.
</div>

### 🟢 Chuba Hubbard (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> As expected, Rico Dowdle took over as the No. 1 back for Carolina rather than working in a timeshare with Hubbard, and he turned 25 totes into 130 rushing yards and two TDs. It's the first time Hubbard has failed to get double-digit carries in a game when healthy since Week 1 of 2024, but it likely won't be the last as Dowdle continues to build job security in the starting role. Hubbard's best chance of making an impact in Week 10 might be if the Panthers can build a big lead at home against the Saints, offering the potential for some garbage-time touches.
</div>

### 🟢 Kyle Monangai (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The rookie seventh-round pick got the starting call due to both D'Andre Swift (groin) and Roschon Johnson (back) being sidelined, and Monangai delivered even better returns than he was already projected for while facing a highly porous Bengals defense. Monangai's longest run of the day went for an impressive 39 yards, one of his three gains of 10-plus yards on the ground. The standout performance certainly gives the Bears confidence -- and perhaps the luxury of sitting Swift out an extra week if he's not fully healthy -- when they draw another extremely favorable matchup for the running game in that of the visiting Giants in Week 10.
</div>

### 🟢 Ja'Marr Chase (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Chase played a rare second fiddle to fellow wideout Tee Higgins, who recorded one more reception and target apiece while also outpacing Chase by 10 yards. Nevertheless, Chase still continued to display excellent chemistry with Joe Flacco, who has peppered him with an astounding 50 targets in the last three games alone. Chase has eclipsed the century mark on four occasions overall, and he's carrying a bloated 76-831-5 receiving line into a Week 11 road matchup against the Steelers on Sunday, Nov. 16 following a Week 10 bye.
</div>

### 🟢 David Montgomery (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Montgomery outpaced Jahmyr Gibbs by two carries and was the only one of the two to get into the end zone, doing so via a two-yard run early in the second quarter. The veteran back also short-circuited a drive in the third quarter, however, as he lost a fumble that was recovered by the Vikings at the Lions' 34-yard line and led to a Minnesota touchdown five plays later. Montgomery and Gibbs figure to continue in their usual timeshare when the Lions face the Commanders on the road in Week 10.
</div>

### 🟢 Christian Watson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Most of his production came on a 52-yard reception early in the second quarter that set up a field goal for the Packers' first points of the game. Watson has seen exactly four targets in back-to-back weeks since completing his recovery from a torn ACL and making his season debut, but his role in the passing attack could grow significantly as both Tucker Kraft (knee) and Matthew Golden (shoulder) left Sunday's loss in the second half and didn't return. If those injuries prove to be serious, Watson would likely become Jordan Love's No. 2 target in Week 10 against the Eagles.
</div>

### 🟢 Jaylin Noel (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Following a couple of productive weeks during which Houston was without top wide receivers Nico Collins and Christian Kirk, Noel was nearly invisible on offense with the veterans back on the field. Noel was reduced to impacting the game on special teams, which he did early in the third quarter on a 45-yard punt return to set up the team's final score. The presence of Collins and Kirk dampened the involvement of both Noel and fellow rookie wideout Jayden Higgins (one target). The loss of starting quarterback C.J. Stroud (concussion) may have also played a role. The Texans gained just 87 yards on seven second-half possessions and punted on its final six drives with Davis Mills under center.
</div>

### 🟢 Dalton Schultz (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The veteran tight end did most of his damage on a 47-yard reception from C.J. Stroud (concussion) in the first quarter to set up Houston's first of five field goals on the afternoon. Schultz wound up second on the team in receptions behind Nico Collins' seven, but the ceiling for the entire Texans passing attack was downgraded when Davis Mills replaced Stroud early in the second quarter. If Mills gets the start in Week 10 against the Jaguars, Schultz should still be a reliable possession option given his impressive 17-199-0 line on 21 targets over three games since Houston's bye.
</div>

### 🟢 Josh Downs (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Downs saw a season-high nine targets, though that came on 50 passing attempts from Daniel Jones. Most of his production also came with the Colts down three scores in the final quarter, logging 35 yards and his touchdown in the final 13 minutes of game time. While that context is important, Downs has managed to find the end zone in three straight matchups.
</div>

### 🟢 Travis Etienne Jr. (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Etienne experienced his largest workload to date in 2025 by setting new season highs in carries and receptions Sunday. The increased volume did not result in his finest fantasy performance, however, after backup Bhayshul Tuten and QB Trevor Lawrence combined to vulture three rushing scores from Jacksonville's starting tailback. It was still a solid overall showing from Etienne, who will continue spearheading the Jaguars' rushing attack against the Texans next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Matthew Stafford (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Stafford had an exceptional performance on limited volume, completing five passes of at least 20 yards -- including a 39-yard strike down the right sideline while beating double-coverage for a touchdown to Puka Nacua (chest). Stafford converted an additional three touchdowns, coming from four, three and one yard away. Even though Stafford threw only nine passes in the second half due to game script, he managed to turn in his fourth game with at least 275 passing yards and has three or more touchdowns in four of his last five matchups.
</div>

### 🟡 Rhamondre Stevenson (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 Spencer Rattler (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> After a 1-7 start to the season, the Saints are opting for a change under center after Rattler beat out Shough, a rookie second-round pick out of Louisville, for the starting job coming out of the preseason. Despite a lackluster supporting cast, Rattler was reasonably efficient as a passer over his eight starts (68 percent completion rate, 6.2 yards per attempt), but he had been mistake-prone over his last two outings. In just over six and a half quarters of football in losses to the Bears and Buccaneers, Rattler took seven sacks, threw four interceptions and lost two fumbles. Unlike the undersized Rattler, Shough (6-foot-5, 219 pounds) offers an ideal frame as a pocket passer and solid arm strength to match it, but his lack of mobility and poor accuracy could render him a less interesting fantasy option.
</div>

### 🔴 A.J. Brown (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>

<strong>Details:</strong> questionable

### 🟡 Cooper Kupp (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 Sam Darnold (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Darnold used Seattle's bye week to regroup following a rough outing against Houston in Week 8, responding with a dominant four-score performance against Washington. It was the second time this season that the veteran starter registered a quartet of touchdown passes, also accomplishing the feat in a shootout against Baker Mayfield and the Buccaneers in Week 5. Outside of an occasional hiccup, Darnold has been posting elite numbers for fantasy managers in 2025, producing over 2,000 passing yards and 16 touchdowns across eight starts with his new club. Darnold should easily check in as a top-10 QB in fantasy for a soft matchup against Arizona next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Jaxon Smith-Njigba (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Smith-Njigba extended his impressive streak of recording over 100 receiving yards to four games in Sunday's one-sided affair. It was the breakout superstar's sixth time cracking the century mark in eight starts this year, resulting in a ridiculous 58-948-4 receiving line over that span. JSN will have a prime opportunity to extend his impressive streak of posting triple-digit totals in Week 10 when the Seahawks face the Cardinals' bottom-third ranked pass defense.
