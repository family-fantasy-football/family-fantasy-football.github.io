## Player Report

#### Marvin Harrison Jr. (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** The second-year wideout hauled in Kyler Murray's longest completion of the day with a 45-yard gain in the second quarter, and Harrison capped that drive with a one-yard TD reception. While he didn't see typical WR1 volume, Harrison's chemistry with Murray bodes very well for the prospects of a 2025 breakout for the fourth overall pick in the 2024 Draft. Harrison will look to build on this performance Week 2 at home against the Panthers.
#### James Cook (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Cook heated up after a quiet first half. He scored a two-yard rushing touchdown in the third quarter and came two yards shy of tacking on a receiving touchdown in the fourth quarter, settling for a 51-yard gain on the play. Cook led the team in rushing yards and exceeded 100 scrimmage yards while Ty Johnson and Ray Davis combined for just three carries and three targets, so Cook unsurprisingly remains the clear lead back after signing a four-year, $48 million extension in August. Buffalo played catch-up throughout this win and will hope for a better defensive performance, which would allow for a more run-heavy game script, in Week 2 against the Jets.
#### Joe Burrow (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Burrow and the Bengals had the ball for only 24:11 and ran just 49 offensive plays. On top of the limited volume, Burrow managed only 5.0 yards per attempt, with his longest completion going for just 20 yards. He did manage to throw a one-yard touchdown to Noah Fant in an otherwise disappointing performance. Burrow should be in for a resurgent showing in Week 2 against Jacksonville.
#### J.K. Dobbins (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Denver's backfield was one of the more interesting ones to monitor in Week 1, and Dobbins ultimately out-touched RJ Harvey 18-7. Dobbins was largely held in check by the Titans' defense, though he did manage 12 carries for 51 yards in the second half -- highlighted by a 19-yard touchdown scamper midway through the fourth quarter to secure victory for the Broncos. Positive game script likely tilted usage in Dobbins' direction, but he looks to be the lead back by at least a small margin for the time being.
#### Jared Goff (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Goff's final line was hardly efficient, as he averaged only 5.8 yards per attempt for the day. However, things were even more bleak for much of the game, as he accounted for 65 yards and his lone touchdown of the day on the Lions' final offensive possession that began with the team down by three scores late in the fourth quarter. Goff still managed some long completions to his top skill-position players, including 32 and 19-yard connections with Sam LaPorta and Amon-Ra St. Brown, respectively, but Goff will be looking for a bounce-back performance in Week 2 against the Bears.
#### Matthew Golden (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The Packers' Week 1 injury report also featured three wide receivers, but Week 2's initial version has Golden swapping in for fellow rookie Savion Williams, while Jayden Reed (foot, DNP) and Dontayvion Wicks (calf, LP) remain listed. On a positive note, Golden would have had a cap on his reps if the team had practiced Monday, and he'll have a pair of opportunities to get some more on-field work ahead of Thursday's game against the Commanders. Golden started in his pro debut Sunday versus the Lions and recorded two catches (on two targets) for 16 yards and one punt return for 11 yards while playing 48 percent (23 of 48) of Green Bay's offensive snaps.
#### Romeo Doubs (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Doubs had only eight receptions of 20+ yards last season and only 22 of the sort through his first 43 games as a professional, but he notched two of them Sunday -- including a career-long 48-yard catch in the second quarter. It could be tough for him to be consistent as part of a Packers offense with a lot of options, but he did start Sunday's contest and his 34 snaps -- out of a possible 48 -- were 11 more than any other Packers wideout.
#### Jayden Higgins (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Higgins wound up leading the Texans in receiving yards despite posting such meager totals. It was a missed opportunity for the second-round rookie, who was elevated into the starting lineup in place of the injured Christian Kirk (hamstring). It is unclear how long Kirk will remain out, but Higgins didn't do enough to inspire confidence in fantasy managers heading into next Monday's tilt against Tampa Bay.
#### Travis Hunter (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Making his NFL debut, the second overall pick in the 2025 Draft led the Jaguars in receptions, although his longest gain went for only 10 yards, and two of his teammates topped him in yardage. Hunter saw most of his action on offense, but his usage at cornerback should increase as the season progresses once he's shown he has the playbook down on offense, something he took a big step toward demonstrating Sunday. Hunter will look to continue building chemistry with Trevor Lawrence on the road Week 2 against the Bengals.
#### Ashton Jeanty (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Jeanty was repeatedly flummoxed by a game Patriots front, although he was able to record his first regular-season touchdown on a tough three-yard run in the third quarter. He did receive ample opportunity on the ground and outpaced the only other Raiders running back to log a carry, Zamir White, by 16 rush attempts. Despite some summertime talk from head coach Pete Carroll that all of his backs would be involved to varying degrees, Jeanty unsurprisingly heads into a Week 2 Monday night home matchup against the Chargers on Sept. 15 as the clear leader of the ground attack.
#### Omarion Hampton (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Hampton was deployed as the every-down starter Friday, generating 15 more combined touches than Najee Harris (eye). The team could have been easing Harris back after he suffered an eye injury that held the back out for all of training camp and the preseason, but the stark difference in touches points the fantasy value arrow strongly in Hampton's direction to kick off the year. If the North Carolina product continues to dominate the backfield work moving forward, he could prove to be an even greater draft day steal than managers originally hoped. Hampton's volume combined with a plus matchup against the Raiders next Monday make him a solid play Week 2.
#### Tyler Higbee (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** For the first time since a Week 9 contest against Green Bay in 2023, the veteran tight end was held without a catch, and failed to even see a target from Matthew Stafford. Higbee was on the field most out of the team's tight ends (35 of 60 snaps versus 29 for Colby Parkinson (shoulder) and 22 for Davis Allen), but Parkinson and Allen recorded catches and Allen scored what turned out to be the game-winning touchdown in the third quarter. Even with Parkinson suffering a sprained AC joint in the win, it'll be hard to trust Higbee or Allen for fantasy purposes given the amount of attention Puka Nacua, Davante Adams and Kyren Williams command for the offense; a Week 2 contest against a Titans defense that held the Broncos' tight ends in check last week doesn't bode well for a potential rebound, either.
#### Ollie Gordon II (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Gordon came into his first professional regular-season game with the prospect of filling a solid No. 2 role behind De'Von Achane. However, a wild first half that saw the Colts establish a 20-0 lead by intermission essentially nullified the ground attack, with Achane himself logging just seven carries on the day. As a result, Gordon was rendered a non-factor, but he could be in line for more opportunities during a Week 2 home matchup against the Patriots since Jaylen Wright (knee) is expected to remain sidelined for that contest.
#### Jaxson Dart (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Earlier in the week, the Giants listed Dart as their No. 2 quarterback on their unofficial depth chart, a sign that the 22-year-old had beaten out veteran Jameis Winston for the top backup gig on the heels of an excellent preseason in which he completed 32 of 47 attempts for 372 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions while adding six carries for 52 yards and another score. Though the Giants will turn to the veteran Wilson to direct the offense in the season opener, the No. 25 overall pick in the draft appears to have made a strong enough impression over the summer to potentially put himself in the mix for a role in Week 1 that may take advantage of his rushing ability. According to Ryan Dunleavy of the New York Post, Dart frequently subbed in for Wilson in the red zone late in drives during training camp, so the Giants could look to use Dart in short-yardage situations in particular. Dart remains likely to get the chance to start at some point during his rookie season, though Wilson would presumably need to perform poorly before the coaching staff would consider a changing of the guard under center.
#### Chig Okonkwo (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Okonkwo's four targets were good enough for the third-highest mark on the team behind only Calvin Ridley and Elic Ayomanor. His longest gain of the day went for 14 yards, the majority of which came after the catch. The Titans' passing attack struggled to get much traction in Week 1, but Okonkwo was on the field for 88 percent of the offensive snaps, which bodes well for his potential to make an impact moving forward.
