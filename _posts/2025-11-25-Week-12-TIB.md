## 🏥 Player Report

### 🔴 Kyler Murray (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Injured Reserve<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Murray has been sidelined since he last suited up Week 5 due to a mid-foot sprain, but because the Cardinals didn't place him on injured reserve until before a Week 10 matchup with the Seahawks, he isn't eligible to return until Sunday, Dec. 7 against the Rams, at the earliest. Having said that, Ian Rapoport of NFL Network reported on Nov. 9 that Murray isn't expected to start again this season unless an injury befalls fellow QB Jacoby Brissett, who has racked up 1,887 yards, 11 touchdowns and three interceptions in six starts since Murray got injured. Murray thus may be facing a backup role whenever he's cleared for game action down the stretch, but he remains embedded in his recovery at the moment.
</div>

### 🟢 Kyle Pitts Sr. (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Pitts was held to two receptions for the third straight week, quickly negating what felt like an improving start to the campaign. The 2021 first-round pick led the Falcons with five targets in a run-heavy game plan Sunday, but his 40 percent catch rate finished dead last amongst his fellow pass catchers. The loss of starting QB Michael Penix (knee) may have affected Pitts, but it wasn't like he was setting the world on fire with a 49-459-1 receiving line across 11 starts this year. Pitts will always tantalize fantasy managers with his potential, but the production simply isn't catching up to the hype.
</div>

### 🟢 Darnell Mooney (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Mooney turned in his best fantasy score this season after breaking off a 49-yard touchdown reception in the fourth quarter to put the game out of reach for New Orleans. The big scoring play helps explain the outburst in production on just three targets Sunday. The absence of Drake London (knee) may have helped Mooney as well, but the latter was averaging 7.5 targets/game in Atlanta's last two games (both with London active), so the elevated role did not result in an uptick in targets. London is being considered week-to-week, but Mooney should stick as a deep-league option even if his teammate returns against the Jets next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Mark Andrews (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Andrews has exceeded 34 receiving yards only once all season, so he has relied on touchdowns to buoy his fantasy value. After scoring 11 times in the 2024 regular season, Andrews has six total touchdowns in 2025. Four of those six scores came in Andrews' previous three games prior to Sunday's quiet outing. Baltimore's struggling passing offense will look to pick things up Thursday against a Bengals defense that has allowed the most production in the NFL to tight ends.
</div>

### 🟢 Keon Coleman (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> 
</div>

### 🟢 Tetairoa McMillan (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> McMillan finished just a yard behind Rico Dowdle for the team lead in receiving yards, and although that came on a modest total, it was an acceptable number when factoring in Bryce Young threw for just 169 yards on the night. McMillan also recorded his third touchdown grab over the last two games on a 29-yard reception late in the third quarter, rounding out his fantasy production nicely. McMillan will aim for a boost in production in a Week 13 home matchup against the red-hot Rams, although that also lines up as a daunting challenge for the inconsistent Young.
</div>

### 🟢 Javonte Williams (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Williams turned in another solid day as a runner, reaching at least 80 yards on the ground for the third consecutive game. His longest gain went for 20 yards, the first time he's hit that threshold since Week 7. Williams also got a bit more involved as a pass catcher, logging his first multi-reception performance in his last six matchups. While he was unable to find the end zone, he did reach 100 yards from scrimmage for the fifth time this season.
</div>

### 🟡 Josh Jacobs (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 Nick Chubb (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Chubb once again was clearly outpaced by rookie backfield mate Woody Marks, who logged 10 more carries and 58 more rushing yards. The veteran now has just 14 total carries in his last three games, and with Marks doing well with his opportunities, Chubb figures to continue filling a modest role in a Week 13 road matchup against the Colts on Sunday, Nov. 30.
</div>

### 🟢 Quentin Johnston (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Justin Herbert was pulled early in the second half after the Chargers were manhandled on both sides of the ball. The entirety of the team's passing attack took a hit, but none more so than Johnston, who just garnered 10 targets in Week 10 against the Steelers. It's fair to assume the Chargers will get back on track after their bye against the lowly Raiders in Week 13 , but with difficult matchups against teams like the Eagles and Texans looming after that, as well as divisional clashes with Denver and Kansas City, this might not be the only game that proves to be rough sledding for Johnston.
</div>

### 🟢 Malik Washington (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Washington delivered his second-highest receiving yardage total of the season in the overseas victory, finishing tied for second in catches with Jaylen Waddle and third in yards. Washington also continued to fill his usual full-time returner role, and he now has at least 30 receiving yards in four of the last five games heading into Miami's Week 12 bye.
</div>

### 🟢 Justin Jefferson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> It's small consolation for Jefferson's frustrated fantasy managers, but the star wideout either tied for the lead (receptions) or set the pace (receiving yards, targets) for the Vikings on the afternoon in all three major receiving categories. However, J.J. McCarthy's continued struggles led to Jefferson's third sub-50-yard effort in the last four contests, and there presently doesn't appear to be any light at the end of the tunnel for Minnesota's air attack. Jefferson's next matchup doesn't offer any solace, either, considering a Week 13 road matchup against the daunting Seahawks defense awaits next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Theo Johnson (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Just over half of Johnson's yards came on a 39-yard catch in the fourth quarter. The 2024 fourth-round pick established a new single-game career high for receiving yards, topping his Week 10 total of 75 against the Bears by two yards. Johnson has emerged as a consistent receiving option heading into a Week 13 trip to New England, regardless of whether the Giants start Jameis Winston for a third consecutive game or get rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart (concussion) back.
</div>

### 🟢 Justin Fields (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Brady Cook is on the Jets' practice squad, but at this stage Glenn notes that the 24-year-old signal caller is still developing, per Eric Allen of the team's official site. As a result, Fields -- who went 2-7 over his nine starts for the 2-8 Jets -- will back up Tyrod Taylor, who has officially been named the starter versus Baltimore this weekend.
</div>

### 🟢 Mason Rudolph (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Rudolph drew a spot start with Aaron Rodgers (wrist) sidelined and managed to move the Steelers' offense fairly effectively, leading three touchdown drives. His lone passing score came on a short six-yard swing pass to DK Metcalf, and he was generally most comfortable working in short areas of the field. That led to a mediocre fantasy performance, and Rudolph's effort also came up short on the field after a critical lost fumble late in the third quarter that changed the momentum of the game. Head coach Mike Tomlin indicated after the game that Rodgers is likely to return in Week 13 against Buffalo, per Teresa Varley of the Steelers' official site, meaning Rudolph will likely return to the bench.
</div>

### 🟢 Chris Godwin Jr. (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Godwin was active for only the third time this season and for the first time since Week 5. He had an underwhelming stat line, though the entire Tampa Bay offense was stifled. Godwin could see improved results in a Week 13 matchup against Arizona, though that will be very dependent on the ability of Baker Mayfield (shoulder) to suit up.
