## Player Report

#### Kyler Murray (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** The 28-year-old QB did get sacked five times, but it was otherwise a very sharp performance from Murray in the season opener. Both touchdown passes came in the red zone in the second quarter, as he found Marvin Harrison for a one-yard score before chucking a shovel pass to James Conner for a four-yard TD. Murray threw multiple TD passes only four times in 17 regular-season games in 2024, so this was a very encouraging start to 2025 for the Cardinals' passing game. He figures to be productive again at home Week 2 against the Panthers.
#### Darnell Mooney (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** questionable
#### Kyle Pitts Sr. (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The talented but oft-maligned tight end got his season off to a rousing start, finishing second in receptions, targets and receiving yards on the Falcons for the afternoon while displaying plenty of chemistry with Michael Penix as the latter begins his first full season as a starter. Pitts took full advantage of a matchup against a Buccaneers defense that's notoriously generous to tight ends, however, so it remains to be seen if he can carry the momentum over into a Week 2 road showdown against the Vikings next Sunday night.
#### Mark Andrews (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Andrews was inexplicably absent from the scoring parade on a night where the Ravens dropped a 40-burger. Perhaps the veteran tight end was still dealing with the undisclosed injury that kept him out of preseason action. Whatever the case, Andrews missed a prime opportunity to operate as the top tight end with Isaiah Likely (foot) sitting this one out. The latter could return as soon as next Sunday's tilt against the Browns, but Andrews didn't inspire confidence in fantasy managers even if Likely misses a second consecutive game.
#### Keon Coleman (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Coleman caught a deflected ball for a 10-yard touchdown to make it a one-possession game in the fourth quarter. He also had two failed two-point conversions thrown his way and was brought down by the last defender with a shoestring tackle shortly before Buffalo's game-winning field goal, so Coleman had opportunities for an even more impressive line Sunday. The 2024 second-round pick struggled to create separation as a rookie, but he got his sophomore season off to a strong start, leading the team in receiving yards, catches and targets while setting new career highs in the last two categories. Coleman will look to build on this breakout performance in a tricky Week 2 matchup against Sauce Gardner and the Jets.
#### Tetairoa McMillan (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** The eighth overall pick in the 2025 Draft was the unquestioned top wideout for the Panthers right out of the gate, as he led the team in targets, catches and receiving yards in a mostly disappointing day for Bryce Young and the passing game. McMillan will need better performances from his quarterback to turn that kind of volume into consistent production, but it was still an encouraging start to his pro career. He'll look to make a bigger impact on the road Week 2 against the Cardinals.
#### Javonte Williams (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The offseason addition took the first play from scrimmage of the season for a seven-yard gain on his first regular-season carry in a Dallas uniform, a harbinger of what would be a strong debut -- albeit one that benefitted from Philadelphia star defensive tackle Jalen Carter getting ejected immediately after the opening kickoff. Williams would go on to cap off the opening possession with a one-yard touchdown run, and he added another one-yard score on the first play of the second quarter. Backfield mate Miles Sanders had the run of the night with a 49-yard scamper in the third quarter, but he'd go on to fumble at the Eagles' 10-yard line five plays later. Thursday's usage appears to indicate Williams will usually serve in the lead early-down role, and the Week 2 home opener against the Giants on Sunday, Sept. 14 will provide the next opportunity to see the backfield pecking order play out.
#### Isaac TeSlaa (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** TeSlaa flashed in his limited opportunities Week 1, scoring a highlight reel 13-yard touchdown on his lone target with 55 seconds left in the loss. Campbell indicated that part of the reason for TeSlaa's low snap count can be attributed to the illness that limited his practice activity heading into the matchup against Green Bay. The rookie third-rounder figures to see increased playing time immediately in Week 2 against the Vikings on Monday Night Football, though it could take time before he's given a true opportunity to surpass Kalif Raymond as the No. 3 receiver behind Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jameson Williams.
#### Nick Chubb (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Chubb was the Texans' lead back as expected Sunday, receiving 10 more carries than the next running back on the depth chart. The 29-year-old flashed glimpses of his former All-Pro form with a healthy average of 4.6 yards per carry. Catastrophic injuries derailed the end of Chubb's tenure with Cleveland, but a clean bill of health could result in a career renaissance with Houston. With Joe Mixon (foot/ankle) still without a timetable to return, Chubb is worth a look against the Buccaneers next Monday if he went overlooked in drafts.
#### Quentin Johnston (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Johnston looked like a fantasy stud in Brazil after cashing in on two of Justin Herbert's trio of touchdown passes. The third-year wideout has had his shares of ups and downs, but this is the kind of performance the Chargers had in mind when they selected Johnston in the first round of the 2023 NFL Draft. It is worth noting that both Keenan Allen (7-68-1) and Ladd McConkey (6-74-0) finished with more targets and receptions in Friday's win. That said, if the Chargers offense continues to air out it out like we saw against the Chiefs, then all three starting receivers theoretically could eat this season. Johnston appears to be a priority addition ahead of next Monday's matchup against the Raiders.
#### Justin Jefferson (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Like the rest of the Vikings offense, Jefferson had a mostly forgettable first three quarters. However, the star wideout eventually finished with team-high reception and target totals, and he recorded his first touchdown from J.J. McCarthy on a 13-yard grab early in the fourth quarter. Jefferson should naturally serve as McCarthy's top target as the season unfolds, and it was clear the second-year signal-caller was still getting acclimated to the NFL game in a tough road environment Monday night after a knee injury wiped out his entire 2024 rookie campaign. Jefferson will be in what should be more favorable conditions for strong production when the Vikings get a visit from the Falcons for a Week 2 home matchup on Sunday night.
#### TreVeyon Henderson (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** The rookie second-round pick was given plenty of opportunity in his first NFL regular-season game, and even when game script turned somewhat away from the run, Henderson remained involved as a receiver on his way to a co-team-high reception total. Backfield mate Rhamondre Stevenson outpaced Henderson by only two carries, which would appear to bode well for the latter's prospects in a Week 2 road matchup next Sunday against what appears to be a porous Dolphins defense.
#### Malik Nabers (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Nabers caught only two of five first-half targets for 23 yards as Russell Wilson mustered only 58 passing yards in his first two quarters as the Giants' quarterback. Things didn't get much better for the Giants on offense in the second half, though the cream rose to the top with Nabers finishing as the team leader in targets and receiving yards. New York doesn't seem to have upgraded at the quarterback position with the switch from Daniel Jones to Wilson, but it may not be long until Nabers is catching passes from rookie first-round pick Jaxson Dart if things don't pick up offensively. Wilson is likely to remain the starting quarterback in Week 2 at Dallas.
#### Justin Fields (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Fields connected with Garrett Wilson for a 33-yard touchdown in the first quarter, then gave the Jets a nine-point lead with a two-yard rushing touchdown in the third quarter, one play after a 21-yard completion to Wilson got them in scoring range. Fields ran in another touchdown on fourth-and-goal from the one-yard line to restore New York's lead at 32-31 with 7:01 to play, but the Steelers responded with a field goal and Fields couldn't get the Jets back into scoring range on the final drive. The Jets' new quarterback will look to build on this strong debut in Week 2 against the Bills.
