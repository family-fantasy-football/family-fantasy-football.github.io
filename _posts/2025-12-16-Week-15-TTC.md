## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Rico Dowdle (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Dowdle reclaimed the lead-back role in Carolina, out-touching Chuba Hubbard 17-9. However, he found very limited room to run, with his longest gain going for only eight yards while averaging under 4.0 yards per carry for the fourth time in his last five games. Dowdle did manage to save his day with a four-yard touchdown midway through the first quarter, his first time reaching the end zone since Week 10. Overall, Dowdle has failed to reach 100 yards from scrimmage in four of his last five games despite seeing at least 17 touches in all but one matchup in that span.
</div>

### 🟢 Bryce Young (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> As has been the case for much of the season, the Panthers were content to rely on the ground game to power their offense. That limited Young to 25 or fewer pass attempts for the sixth time in his last eight matchups, though he did a solid job pushing the ball down the field when called upon. Young's performance was highlighted by a 32-yard touchdown pass that hit Jalen Coker in stride down the right sideline, and he also tacked on three additional completions of at least 20 yards. Despite the positives, Young has been held below 200 passing yards in all but three games this season, and he now has one or fewer touchdowns in four of the team's last six games.
</div>

### 🟢 Chase Brown (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Brown's day was a good representation of the Bengals' afternoon against the Ravens' defense. His longest play from scrimmage was 10 yards, and his longest reception went for seven yards.  Meanwhile, teammate Samaje Perine left with an ankle injury but returned in time for the Bengals' final drive. Brown should carry a heavy workload next week against Miami.
</div>

### 🟢 Dak Prescott (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Prescott led the Cowboys' offense effectively for most of the game, but the unit continuously stalled in the red zone. The team managed only two touchdowns, both of which came on the ground, on five trips inside the red zone. That led to Prescott's third scoreless game of the season, and he also fell short of 300 passing yards for the first time in his last three matchups. Prescott's track record suggests he'll bounce back in Week 16 against the Chargers, but he'll draw another tough matchup.
</div>

### 🟢 CeeDee Lamb (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Cowboys' pass catchers almost universally disappointed in Sunday night's loss, with Lamb being the only exception. He paced the team in every statistical category while commanding double-digit targets for the sixth time in 11 games this season. Lamb was efficient with the opportunity primarily due to a pair of 30-yard receptions, and he topped 100 receiving yards for the third straight game.
</div>

### 🟢 Troy Franklin (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Franklin had been phased out of the Denver offense in the last two games, combining to earn only seven targets. However, he reemerged due to Pat Bryant (hamstring) being sidelined, finishing second on the team in yards, receptions and targets. Franklin had a trio of catches that went for at least 15 yards, the most important of which was a 23-yard touchdown grab to end the third quarter. He made the case to remain a key part of Denver's offense moving forward, though his role is uncertain heading into a Week 16 matchup against the Jaguars -- particularly if Bryant can return to the field.
</div>

### 🟢 RJ Harvey (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Harvey got off to a tough start, as he fumbled on Denver's opening possession and his third touch of the game. He was benched for the team's next possession, though he was the team's lead back from there and managed a season-high carry total. As has been the case for most of his rookie season, Harvey wasn't efficient, with his longest gain of the night going for only eight yards. However, he did manage to punch in a four-yard rushing score late in the contest, his third straight game reaching the end zone. With J.K. Dobbins (foot) still likely to be sidelined for the foreseeable future, Harvey's role as the lead back looks secure, and he has a minimum of 16 touches in each of his last three games.
</div>

### 🟢 Brenton Strange (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The 25-year-old didn't get on the board until a 26-yard reception in the third quarter, and he's now totaled just four catches for 53 yards across the past two games. Jacksonville's offense has been humming with seven straight games of at least 25 points, the last three of which have been blowout victories. Strange has clearly established himself as the Jaguars' No. 1 tight end but has limited upside for fantasy managers with the offense primarily running through Travis Etienne, Brian Thomas and Jakobi Meyers. In nine games this season, Strange has caught 32 passes for 395 yards and one touchdown.
</div>

### 🟢 Patrick Mahomes (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Out<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Mahomes was in Dallas on Monday to get a second opinion on his knee injury. Per Ian Rapoport of NFL Network, Mahomes tore the LCL in addition to the ACL in his left knee, making recovery potentially more complicated. The Chiefs noted that Mahomes' rehab will begin immediately, but a timeline for his return to the field has not been announced. Gardner Minshew will serve as the Chiefs' starter for the rest of the 2025 season.
</div>

### 🟢 Xavier Worthy (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Prior to leaving the game, Worthy did not record a catch. While he's sidelined, JuJu Smith-Schuster, Tyquan Thornton, Nikko Remigio and Jalen Royals are candidates to see added snaps alongside top WR Rashee Rice.
</div>

### 🟢 Stefon Diggs (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Diggs set season highs with 10 catches for 146 yards in his Week 5 return to Buffalo, but he couldn't muster much in the rematch 10 weeks later. He has faded down the stretch with 26 or fewer receiving yards in each of the past three games. The Patriots have relied primarily on the running game with the weather getting colder, and that game plan may not change in Week 16 at Baltimore.
</div>

### 🟢 TreVeyon Henderson (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Henderson extended New England's lead to 21-0 with a 52-yard touchdown run in the second quarter. The Patriots sputtered in the second half, outside of a 65-yard Henderson touchdown run in the fourth quarter. Henderson has broken out for 150 or more scrimmage yards twice in his last five outings, and he has exceeded 80 scrimmage yards in six consecutive games. The rookie second-round pick will look to keep rolling in Week 16 against the Ravens on SNF.
</div>

### 🟢 Tyrone Tracy Jr. (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> One game after Devin Singletary led the Giants backfield with 102 scrimmage yards and a score, it was Tracy's turn to pop, as he ran for a 12-yard TD in the second quarter and caught an 18-yard toss from Jaxson Dart in the third. The two touchdowns were Tracy's first trips to the end zone since Week 7, when he recorded his only other score of the season. He'll try to build on this performance in Week 16 against the Vikings.
</div>

### 🟡 Mason Taylor (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 Sean Tucker (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Tucker logged three more touches than Rachaad White behind Bucky Irving, who lapped the Buccaneers' running backs with 16 carries. The third-year back was extremely inefficient in a limited sample, but Tucker did manage to score for the second straight game on a one-yard run to cap off an 11-play drive late in the first quarter. The usage of Tucker and White behind Irving remains hard to predict on a game-to-game basis, capping the upside of both reserve backs heading into a Week 16 road matchup against the Panthers on Sunday, Dec. 21.
</div>

### 🟢 Bucky Irving (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> As his final rushing line implies, Irving was largely held in check by a feisty Falcons front seven, leading to his third straight game averaging under 4.0 yards per carry. Irving was the unquestioned lead back, outpacing Rachaad White by a whopping 15 carries and logging 12 more rush attempts than Sean Tucker as well, though it's worth noting that the Bucs were in the red zone three times Thursday, and Tucker was typically the running back on the field when they were. Irving's reception total was also his lowest of the season, and he'll look to atone against the Panthers on the road in a key Week 16 matchup on Sunday, Dec. 21.
