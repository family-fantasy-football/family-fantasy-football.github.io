## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Trey McBride (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> McBride turned in his finest performance of the year in the Cardinals' ugliest loss of the season. Most fantasy managers could care less about the game result after the stud tight end went off for his first 100-plus yard game of 2025. McBride continued his newfound prowess in the red zone with QB Jacoby Brissett under center, nabbing his fifth touchdown (sixth overall) in the four games the veteran backup has started. The 25-year-old McBride will look to continue feasting against an injury-riddled 49ers defense next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Chuba Hubbard (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The touch and yardage totals were season lows for Hubbard, as he continues to see a massively reduced role with Rico Dowdle getting a look as the clear top option in the Carolina backfield. Hubbard might need an injury to Dowdle to have real fantasy relevance again, as he's managed only 32 scrimmage yards total over the last two games. Hubbard may not need a lot of touches to make a splash in Week 11 against a Falcons defense that just got torched by Jonathan Taylor for 244 rushing yards and three TDs.
</div>

### 🟢 Kyle Monangai (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Monangai broke out for 198 scrimmage yards against the Bengals in Week 9 but was outplayed by D'Andre Swift (groin) in Swift's return from a one-game absence in Week 10. The rookie seventh-round pick out of Rutgers opened the scoring with an eight-yard touchdown run in the first quarter but was out-touched, 18-7, by Swift. Head coach Ben Johnson may be attempting to replicate the backfield formula he used as the Lions' offensive coordinator the previous couple seasons, with the 5-foot-8, 207-pound Monangai providing power inside a la David Montgomery while Swift's used in a more versatile role like Jahmyr Gibbs. Swift is still the top option for the Bears, but Monangai should remain involved in Week 11 against the Vikings.
</div>

### 🟢 Ja'Marr Chase (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Chase played a rare second fiddle to fellow wideout Tee Higgins, who recorded one more reception and target apiece while also outpacing Chase by 10 yards. Nevertheless, Chase still continued to display excellent chemistry with Joe Flacco, who has peppered him with an astounding 50 targets in the last three games alone. Chase has eclipsed the century mark on four occasions overall, and he's carrying a bloated 76-831-5 receiving line into a Week 11 road matchup against the Steelers on Sunday, Nov. 16 following a Week 10 bye.
</div>

### 🟢 David Montgomery (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Montgomery was overshadowed by a huge performance from Jahmyr Gibbs, but he still saw an even split in carries. He also turned in a relatively efficient outing, including five rushes of at least five yards. While it was generally a positive outing for Montgomery, this marked only the fourth time he's topped 50 rushing yards this season, and he remains dependent on finding the end zone to turn in useful fantasy performances.
</div>

### 🟢 Christian Watson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Watson recorded gains of 20 and 25 yards on his pair of grabs, the latter getting the Packers out of the shadow of their own goalposts just before the two-minute warning in the fourth quarter. His yardage total was a team-high figure, and he's now averaged over 20.0 yards per reception in all three games he's played this season. Romeo Doubs' early exit Monday due to a chest injury and Matthew Golden's (shoulder) inactive status both played a part in Watson continuing to operate as a primary downfield option, and that may persist in a Week 11 road matchup against the Giants if one or both of his teammates remain sidelined.
</div>

### 🟢 Dalton Schultz (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The veteran tight end saw a season high in targets and topped 50 receiving yards for the fourth time in the last five games, this time with Davis Mills at QB instead of C.J. Stroud (concussion). Schultz capped his day with his first TD of the season, a seven-yard strike from Mills in the fourth quarter as the Texans put together a stunning comeback from a 29-10 deficit. Schultz will take a 45-438-1 line on 59 targets through nine contests into a Week 11 tilt against the Titans.
</div>

### 🟢 Josh Downs (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Downs took a clear back seat to Michael Pittman and Alec Pierce, as well as rookie tight end Tyler Warren, during Indianapolis' victory in Berlin, a disappointing outcome given that he had scored in three consecutive appearances prior to Week 10. The Colts are headed into a bye, so Downs' next chance to bounce back will come in Kansas City in Week 12. Even after a disappointing outing, Downs retains solid fantasy value, especially in PPR formats.
</div>

### 🟢 Travis Etienne Jr. (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The fourth-year RB produced the Jaguars' last score of the afternoon on a six-yard run in the third quarter, giving the team a 29-10 lead that shockingly evaporated in the fourth. Etienne ended a four-game TD drought in the process, and on the season he's amassed 786 scrimmage yards and four total touchdowns (three rushing, one receiving) through nine contests. He'll look to keep rolling in Week 11 against the Chargers.
</div>

### 🟢 Matthew Stafford (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Stafford's second touchdown strike was the 400th touchdown pass of his decorated career, becoming just the ninth quarterback in NFL history to reach that mark. The 37-year-old kept making history by becoming the first signal-caller to record at least four touchdown passes with no interceptions over three consecutive contests. Stafford's 25 touchdown passes represent his highest mark since the 41 he threw in the regular season the year the Rams won Super Bowl LVI. The 2009 first-overall pick is playing some of the best ball of his career heading into a crucial home tilt against the 7-2 Seahawks next Sunday.
</div>

### 🔴 Rhamondre Stevenson (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Fellow RBs TreVeyon Henderson (knee) and Terrell Jennings (knee) also were listed as limited, meaning all three players at the position on the Patriots' active roster are banged up at the moment. Stevenson has missed the last two games due to a toe injury, but after not practicing in any capacity last week, his listed activity level Monday is a step in the right direction as New England prepares to host the Jets on Thursday.
</div>

### 🟢 A.J. Brown (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Brown used the Eagles' bye week to recover from a hamstring injury that wound up costing him just one game on the schedule. The 28-year-old handled a full week of practice leading up to Monday's contest and showed no visible limitations running routes. The poor fantasy night was more the result of a grueling defensive battle that went scoreless for two-plus quarters. Brown will have a better opportunity to shine in a softer matchup at home against the Lions on Sunday Night Football in Week 11.
</div>

### 🟡 Tory Horton (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 Cooper Kupp (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Kupp showed no ill effects from the hamstring injury that had his status for Sunday in question, as he scampered for 67 yards on one of his two catches. The veteran receiver is averaging just two targets over the Seahawks' last three contests, putting a hard cap on his fantasy value despite recording solid production on low usage. The addition of WR Rashid Shaheed at the trade deadline could eventually cut into Kupp's role further as the season progresses. That said, Kupp's hot play of late combined with the potential to produce against his former club keeps him in the fantasy conversation against the Rams next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Sam Darnold (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> It was a peculiar stat line from Darnold after he completed 83 percent of his attempts while committing three turnovers in a massive victory. Seattle's rushing attack (two touchdowns) and defense (two touchdowns) did all the heavy lifting on offense outside of an impressive touchdown pass to Jaxon Smith-Njigba on the game's opening drive. Darnold has sprinkled in a couple of these duds amongst mostly standout performances through nine starts. Fantasy managers should feel confident about a bounce-back game from Darnold in Week 11 when the Seahawks match high-octane offenses with the Rams next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Jaxon Smith-Njigba (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Smith-Njigba got off to a hot start Sunday when he peeled the top off of Arizona's defense for a 43-yard touchdown on the game's opening drive. JSN was checked for a concussion in the first half, but he returned promptly without issue for the remainder of the contest. The explosive play would end up accounting for most of Smith-Njigba's final fantasy score -- even with the Seahawks dropping 44 points -- after Seattle's defense and rushing attack accounted for the remaining four touchdowns. The breakout superstar became the first player to reach 1,000 yards in receiving this season, and he sits just 89 yards shy of the career best 1,130 yards he posted in 2024. Smith-Njigba will attempt to accomplish the personal achievement in a pivotal NFC West matchup against the Rams next Sunday.
