## Player Report

#### Trey McBride (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** McBride led all Cardinals in targets and receptions while hauling in Kyler Murray's only touchdown pass in Sunday's narrow loss. The 25-year-old McBride didn't waste much time cracking the end zone this season after needing 15 starts to catch his first touchdown in 2024. McBride is proving to be a consistent fantasy producer at the tight end position, carrying a 17-182-1 receiving line into a Week 4 matchup against the Seahawks on Thursday Night Football.
#### DeAndre Hopkins (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The veteran's snap share remains low despite his per-target productivity. Hopkins has caught five of six targets for 112 yards and two touchdowns through three games. He logged 14 snaps Monday, which amounted to just a quarter of the Ravens' offensive plays while Zay Flowers, Rashod Bateman and Tylan Wallace each played over 50 percent of the snaps. While Hopkins has shown he can still play at a high level so far, the low projected snap and target volume make him a difficult player to feel confident starting in redraft leagues.
#### Chuba Hubbard (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Hubbard continued to see his workload shrink relative to Rico Dowdle, with Hubbard earning 19 touches to Dowdle's 11. That's still plenty of volume to be productive, but the split cost Hubbard a potential touchdown when Dowdle handled an entire drive early in the fourth quarter that concluded with him finding the end zone. The positive news for Hubbard is that he was still efficient with his touches by consistently picking up chunk gains, and he remains entrenched as the lead back in Carolina.
#### Ja'Marr Chase (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Chase was part of the collateral damage of a miserable day for the Bengals on both sides of the ball. The aggressive Vikings defense capitalized on Jake Browning's presence under center to collect two interceptions, three sacks and three fumble recoveries, but Chase still managed to tie for the team lead in receptions and also set the pace in receiving yards and targets. The star wideout's production will naturally be hard to trust on a week-to-week basis for as long as Joe Burrow (IR, toe) remains out, but Chase will undoubtedly remain heavily involved in an unenviable Week 4 road matchup against the Broncos on Monday night, Sept. 29.
#### David Montgomery (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Montgomery waltzed into a tough road environment and casually dropped a new personal best of 151 rushing yards in a single game. The seven-year pro's longest run of 72 yards surprisingly did not result in either of his two trips to the end zone Monday. Jahmyr Gibbs (22-67-2) finished with 10 more carries and 14 more touches than Montgomery, which was the largest disparity through three weeks for Detroit's talented backfield tandem. Expect the Lions to feed the Browns a heavy dose of both Montgomery and Gibbs when the two teams meet Week 4.
#### Dalton Schultz (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Schultz had season highs in both targets and receiving yards, as the Texans made a concerted effort to get the passing game going. C.J. Stroud's 40 dropbacks (38 attempts, two sacks) were the most in three games, but he threw for only 204 yards (5.4 YPA). The passing volume meant opportunities for Schultz existed even with the season debut of No. 2 wideout Christian Kirk (eight targets). At 0-3 and getting very little offense through the air, the Texans might consider a heavier run-based attack, which would impact all receivers.
#### Josh Downs (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The Colts had a relatively flat target distribution, but Downs still slipped behind each of Michael Pittman, Alec Pierce and Tyler Warren for opportunities in the passing game. Downs managed an impressive 29-yard catch early in the first quarter to set up a field goal, but he now has only two catches in two of three games to begin the campaign.
#### Travis Etienne Jr. (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Etienne found running room at a premium against a talented Texans front, but he was able to rescue fantasy managers from a washout by recording a 10-yard touchdown run with just under two minutes remaining. The score, Etienne's first on the ground in 2025, delivered what would prove to be the game-winning points. Etienne has seen his rushing yardage total drop in each of the last two contests after opening the season with a 143-yard effort against the Panthers, a trend he'll aim to reverse in a Week 4 road interconference clash against the 49ers.
#### Matthew Stafford (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Stafford and the Rams' offense left a lot on the table despite scoring 26 points. He threw an interception on the opening possession, then had a pair of drives stall inside the red zone in the first half. The end result was that Stafford averaged only 5.9 yards per attempt, though he also had some positives in the performance. Most notably, he connected with Davante Adams on a deep 44-yard score late in the first quarter, and he also found Kyren Williams for a 10-yard score on the opening drive of the third quarter. Stafford has multiple touchdowns in each of his last two games, and he should have the chance to bounce back from an efficiency perspective in Week 4 against the Colts.
#### Rhamondre Stevenson (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** After a very impressive Week 2 performance, Stevenson was largely to blame for New England's Week 3 loss, losing the ball on the first possession to set up Pittsburgh's first TD of the day, and then fumbling again on the Steelers' one-yard line in the third quarter. The Patriots' running game struggled as a whole Sunday, with QB Drake Maye leading the team in rushing yards and Antonio Gibson also losing a fumble. Stevenson's struggles holding onto the ball could open the door for rookie  TreVeyon Henderson to see a much bigger role in Week 4 against the Panthers.
#### Spencer Rattler (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Rattler failed to recreate the three-touchdown performance we saw from him in Week 2, resulting in numbers closer to his pedestrian game against Atlanta to open the season. The Saints were outmatched from the jump, falling behind by 32 points at halftime. Things got so bad that rookie backup Tyler Shough saw the field in garbage time. It wouldn't be surprising to see the quarterbacks flip roles at some point this season for the 0-3 Saints. For now, Rattler figures to continue starting for New Orleans when the team travels to Buffalo next Sunday.
#### A.J. Brown (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** The Eagles had taken to the air sparingly in the first two weeks of this season, and Brown entered the game with 35 total yards from scrimmage. However, Philadelphia fell behind early against the Rams, and Jalen Hurts had to attempt 32 passes in a comeback effort, allowing Brown to get more opportunity. He turned that into several highlight-worthy plays, including a 38-yard catch deep down the right sideline early in the third quarter and a nine-yard touchdown catch one possession later. It's no surprise that Brown was productive when given the chance, and the Eagles could be pushed once again in a Week 4 matchup against the Bucs.
#### Brian Robinson Jr. (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Robinson saw his usage drop to nine percent on offense (six snaps) against the Cardinals, and his two touches checked in well below the 8.5 he averaged over the first two weeks of the campaign. The 26-year-old made the most of his sparse opportunities Sunday, ripping off a season best 19-yard run in the fourth quarter. No other backup saw the field on offense in the win, so Robinson's reduced playing time was likely the result of the 49ers leaning on Christian McCaffrey heavily against a division opponent. Expect Robinson to continue receiving a handful of carries backing up CMC against the Jaguars next Sunday.
#### Cooper Kupp (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Kupp reverted to his low-usage role after commanding nine targets in a Week 2 win over Las Vegas. The veteran wideout finished third in targets, receptions and yardage for the Seahawks behind Jaxon Smith-Njigba (5-96-1) and Tory Horton (3-32-1). Perhaps Kupp can get more involved in Week 4 against a familiar NFC West opponent in the Cardinals on Thursday Night Football.
#### Sam Darnold (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Darnold had an easy day at the office Sunday, generating most of his statistical production in a lopsided first half of action. Things got so out of hand in the second half that Seattle was able to get both of its backup quarterbacks on the field during garbage time. This was Darnold's finest performance as a member of the Seahawks, and he is now averaging 221.0 passing yards to go along with four touchdowns and two interceptions through three starts in 2025. Darnold is looking like a mid-level fantasy option heading into a Week 4 matchup against the Cardinals on Thursday Night Football.
