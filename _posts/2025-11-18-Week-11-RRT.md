## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Trey McBride (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> McBride continued his ridiculous hot streak by hitting pay dirt in his fifth straight contest while also recording his second consecutive 100-yard game. The 25-year-old somehow did not finish as the Cardinals' leading receiver, as that honor went to WR Michael Wilson (15-185-0) in a game during which QB Jacoby Brissett set an NFL regular-season record with 47 completed passes in a single game. McBride has been a fantasy beast in 2025, generating 71 receptions, 718 yards and seven touchdowns for managers across 10 starts. The Colorado State product will look to extend his scoring streak to six games against the Jaguars next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Chuba Hubbard (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The 26-year-old has now received just 10 total touches in the Panthers' last two games, cementing his No. 2 slotting behind Rico Dowdle, who tallied 100 total yards on 24 touches in Sunday's win. Since Dowdle took over as Carolina's No. 1 option in the Week 9 win over the Packers, Hubbard has managed just 52 rushing yards on 12 attempts. He's expected to continue operating in a reserve role in the Week 12 matchup against the 49ers.
</div>

### 🟢 Kyle Monangai (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Monangai scored a one-yard rushing touchdown to give the Bears a 7-3 lead in the second quarter, one play after setting up the goal-line opportunity with a powerful six-yard run to convert on third-and-4. He ceded most of the rushing opportunities to D'Andre Swift (21 carries for 90 yards) for the second straight game since Swift returned from a one-game absence due to a groin injury, but Monangai has scored a touchdown in both of those games. Monangai should continue to play a complementary role, including some short-yardage opportunities, in Week 12 against the Steelers.
</div>

### 🟢 Ja'Marr Chase (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Suspension<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> According to Kelsey Conway of The Cincinnati Enquirer, Chase is appealing the suspension, which he received after he spat on Steelers defensive back Jalen Ramsey in Sunday's 34-12 loss. As Ben Baby of ESPN.com relays, there is notable precedent for Chase's suspension being upheld; Eagles defensive tackle Jalen Carter was ejected from Philadelphia's Week 1 win over the Cowboys after spitting in the direction of quarterback Dak Prescott following the game's first play from scrimmage, which the NFL viewed as akin to a one-game ban. Assuming Chase's appeal is unsuccessful, Tee Higgins will be in position as the clear No. 1 receiving option for quarterback Joe Flacco in Week 12, while wideout Andrei Iosivas and tight end Noah Fant could also be beneficiaries of increased opportunities in the passing game.
</div>

### 🔴 Joe Burrow (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Injured Reserve<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Bengals had extra reps available for Burrow upon his return to practice in Week 11, as incumbent starter Joe Flacco once again had his practice participation managed while he continues to play through a sprained AC joint in his throwing shoulder. Though Burrow is aiming to return to action Week 13, his availability for that Thanksgiving game could hinge on whether the Bengals have any playoff life at that point in the schedule. The 3-6 Bengals are playing in Pittsburgh against the division-leading Steelers on Sunday, then host the Patriots in Week 12.
</div>

### 🟢 David Montgomery (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Montgomery was limited due to game script, as the Lions possessed the ball for only 24:12  of game time. That led to only his second performance with single-digit touches this season and his second-lowest yardage output of the campaign. While Montgomery will continue to hold a meaningful role in the Detroit offense behind Jahmyr Gibbs, the former's fantasy value is primarily dependent on him finding the end zone.
</div>

### 🟢 Christian Watson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Watson delivered his first multi-TD performance of his injury-shortened season, scoring from one and 17 yards out in the first and fourth quarter, respectively. The second scoring grab was especially impressive, as Watson came down with a contested catch in the right corner of the end zone while surrounded by a pair of defensive backs. Watson should continue in a prominent role during a Week 12 home divisional showdown against the Vikings next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟡 Dalton Schultz (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Schultz has been dealing with a shoulder injury for nearly a month, but he's played in each of the Texans' last four games en route to 21 catches (on 31 targets) for 205 yards and one touchdown. Considering his production hasn't tailed off with Davis Mills and not C.J. Stroud (concussion, DNP on Monday) under center the last two contests, Schultz remains a consideration in fantasy ahead of Thursday's matchup with the Bills. Wednesday's practice report will reveal whether or not Schultz has a Week 12 designation.
</div>

### 🟢 Josh Downs (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Downs took a clear back seat to Michael Pittman and Alec Pierce, as well as rookie tight end Tyler Warren, during Indianapolis' victory in Berlin, a disappointing outcome given that he had scored in three consecutive appearances prior to Week 10. The Colts are headed into a bye, so Downs' next chance to bounce back will come in Kansas City in Week 12. Even after a disappointing outing, Downs retains solid fantasy value, especially in PPR formats.
</div>

### 🟢 Travis Etienne Jr. (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Etienne was sharing plenty of work with Bhayshul Tuten (ankle) early on , but the latter ended up exiting the contest due to injury. That opened up more opportunity for Etienne, who contributed two- and 13-yard scoring runs for his first multi-TD game of the season. Etienne's yardage total was also his second highest since Week 4, and he could be in for a significant workload in a Week 12 road matchup against the Cardinals.
</div>

### 🟢 Matthew Stafford (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Stafford's yardage total dipped as both pass defenses stepped up in the battle for first place in the NFC West, but he avoided mistakes and improved his TD:INT to 22:0 over the past seven starts, while the Rams picked off Sam Darnold four times. Stafford threw a one-yard touchdown pass to Davante Adams in the first quarter and a six-yard touchdown pass to Colby Parkinson in the fourth quarter. The Rams will likely lean more on Stafford's arm in Week 12 against a beatable Buccaneers secondary that just allowed six total touchdowns to fellow potential MVP candidate Josh Allen.
</div>

### 🟡 Rhamondre Stevenson (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The running back has missed New England's last three games, though he returned to practice as a limited participant prior to being ruled out for last Thursday's win over the Jets. It sounds as though Stevenson could have a better chance to return in Week 12 versus the Bengals, though he seems highly unlikely to reclaim the lead role from rookie TreVeyon Henderson. During Stevenson's three-game absence, Henderson has compiled five total touchdowns while averaging over 100 scrimmage yards per contest.
</div>

### 🟢 A.J. Brown (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Brown certainly was not devoid of targets in the primetime victory, pacing his team with six more looks than the next-highest receiver. Blustering winds in Philadelphia prevented many deep shots from being taken on Sunday Night Football, which put a cap on the star wideout's fantasy score outside of PPR formats. Brown has been vocal about his lack of involvement at times this year, so the season-high 11 targets should help ease the thoughts of concerned managers heading into next Sunday's tilt against the Cowboys.
</div>

### 🟡 Tory Horton (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 Cooper Kupp (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Making his return to Los Angeles after he was released by the Rams during the offseason, Kupp was a fixture in two-wide sets alongside Jaxon Smith-Njigba, but Kupp's quiet season continued, as his 23 yards were fifth-most on the team despite being third on Seattle in targets. The 32-year-old has yet to hit 100 yards in a game this season and has just 29 catches for 390 yards and one touchdown on 42 targets through nine games. Even in a plus matchup next Sunday against the Titans, Kupp won't be a recommended fantasy starter.
</div>

### 🟢 Sam Darnold (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Darnold failed to bounce back from last week's three-pick effort, instead lowering the bar by throwing four interceptions for the first time since 2019 during his infamous run with the Jets. It would be unfair to compare that version of the signal-caller to the improved franchise quarterback he developed into over the years, but Darnold is developing a concerning trend of losing his composure in big games. Notably, the last time he faced the Rams -- as a member of the Vikings in 2024 -- he fell flat while committing two turnovers in a playoff loss. The 28-year-old's horrid two-game stretch brings him to 17 touchdowns and 10 interceptions following a red-hot start to the fantasy campaign. Darnold's gaudy passing totals (2,541 yards in 10 starts) keep him in the starting conversation as a fantasy option against the Titans next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Jaxon Smith-Njigba (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Smith-Njigba needed just 89 receiving yards in order to surpass last year's career-best mark of 1,130 yards. The breakout fantasy star completed the personal achievement comfortably Sunday, and in seven fewer contests to boot. It was JSN's seventh 100-yard game in 10 appearances this season, a feat he accomplished just three times in 2024, to continue putting his ascension into perspective. Smith-Njigba figures to continue producing WR1 numbers as the Seahawks look to get back into the win column against the Titans next Sunday.
