## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Harold Fannin Jr. (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Fannin led the team in targets from Shedeur Sanders, as the rookie quarterback made his first NFL start. Whether the Browns have Sanders or Dillon Gabriel (concussion) under center in Week 13 against the 49ers, Fannin should continue to play a prominent role in Cleveland's rookie-heavy offense. Fannin has been targeted at least five times in each of his past six games.
</div>

### 🟡 George Pickens (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Coach Brian Schottenheimer spoke on Pickens' health Monday, saying the wide receiver has a bruised shin that is "sore" following Sunday's win versus the Eagles, per Todd Archer of ESPN.com. The nature of Picken's health concern differs on Dallas' first official Week 13 injury report, but Schottenheimer nonetheless added that he should be good to go Thursday against the Chiefs. Wednesday's report will reveal whether or not Pickens heads into that contest with a designation.
</div>

### 🟢 Jake Ferguson (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Ferguson continued to serve as the third option in the Dallas passing offense behind both George Pickens and CeeDee Lamb. He had one of his better showings in recent weeks, logging lengthy receptions of 19, 17 and 12 yards. Ferguson may not have many spike performances so long as both Pickens and Lamb are healthy, but he has at least four catches in three straight games while reaching 50 yards twice in that span.
</div>

### 🟢 Jahmyr Gibbs (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The 11 catches and 12 targets were career highs for Gibbs as were the 264 scrimmage yards, while the 219 rushing yards were the most ever in a game by a Detroit player not named Barry Sanders. Gibbs saved his best for last as well -- after catching a three-yard TD pass in the second quarter and busting loose for a 49-yard score on the ground in the fourth, the third-year back dashed for a 69-yard rushing touchdown on the first play of OT. Through 11 games this season, Gibbs already has 10 rushing TDs -- his third straight season in double digits -- with 951 rushing yards on 6.1 yards per carry, while adding a 48-379-3 receiving line on 55 targets. He'll look to keep rolling in Week 13 during a Thanksgiving tilt against the Packers.
</div>

### 🟢 Michael Pittman Jr. (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The veteran receiver tied with Tyler Warren for the team lead in receptions and set the pace in targets, although Pittman finished with his second consecutive sub-30-yard tally. The sixth-year pro did find the end zone for the seventh time this season on a six-yard grab in the first quarter, and Pittman has now drawn at least eight targets in four of the last five contests. The veteran wideout draws a tough matchup again in Week 13, as a talented Texans defense drops in for a key divisional clash.
</div>

### 🟢 Daniel Jones (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jones was under 200 passing yards for the first time all season, but he offset the downturn with his first multi-touchdown-pass effort in the last three games. Jones connected with Michael Pittman and Drew Ogletree for scoring tosses of six and four yards, respectively, yet the majority of his success came during the first two quarters. Jones led Indianapolis to only six points after halftime, a key in the Chiefs mounting a comeback from a 20-9 deficit. The veteran signal-caller draws a tough matchup next week as well, as the Texans drop in for a key AFC South clash next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Bhayshul Tuten (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Tuten was able to shake his injury designation during the practice week, but perhaps the ankle was still affecting him based off Sunday's poor results. Starter Travis Etienne -- who was dealing with a shoulder injury himself -- led Jacksonville's backfield with over 100 yards from scrimmage and a touchdown. Tuten was coming off a season-best 15-74-1 rushing line against the Chargers last week, so fantasy managers may want to hold through the rough patches in the event his role continues to expand down the stretch.
</div>

### 🟢 Tre' Harris (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Harris played his usual snap load, but with Los Angeles' offense in disarray and Jacksonville wholly dominating the line of scrimmage, the rookie never stood a chance from a fantasy perspective. The 2025 second-round pick has just nine targets in the last five games after seeing five total in Week 6 despite a typical cadence in terms of playing time.
</div>

### 🟢 Justin Herbert (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The sixth-year pro put together a performance that was about as poor as his numbers indicated, with Herbert finishing with a career-low yardage total. Herbert was sacked just twice but appeared to be under constant duress, and he failed to throw a touchdown pass for the first time all season before being pulled for Trey Lance in the fourth quarter. The Chargers will now have a Week 12 bye to regroup before returning to action in a Week 13 home matchup against the Raiders on Sunday, Nov. 30.
</div>

### 🟢 Davante Adams (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Adams suffered a couple of uncharacteristic drops on Sunday Night Football, but fantasy managers can look past that fact after he converted a pair of successful touchdown grabs in the win. It was the 27th time over the course of the superstar's illustrious career that he has scored multiple touchdowns in a single game, good for seventh all-time among receivers in league history. The 32-year-old has now scored in five consecutive appearances, producing multiple trips to the end zone in three out of those five outings. The NFL's league leader in receiving touchdowns (12) will look to add to the gap between he and Amon-Ra St. Brown (eight) when Adams and the Rams visit the Panthers next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 T.J. Hockenson (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> J.J. McCarthy's abysmal play at quarterback (87 yards passing, two interceptions in the loss) has made almost every Vikings receiver a non-factor for fantasy purposes. Hockensen is at least getting some dump-off passes (seven receptions last two games), but they are not resulting in much yardage. Hockenson's outlook isn't any better next week in a tough matchup at Seattle.
</div>

### 🟢 Drake Maye (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The 294 yards were a season high for the second-year QB. Maye's INT did turn into a pick-six by Geno Stone in the second quarter, but he responded with a nine-play, 70-yard drive on the Patriots' next possession that was capped by a 28-yard TD strike to Hunter Henry. Maye will take a 21:6 TD:INT on the season through 12 games into a Week 13 tilt against the Giants.
</div>

### 🟡 Alvin Kamara (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Kamara has produced at least 1,160 scrimmage yards in each of his first eight NFL regular seasons, but that streak of 1,000-yard campaigns would be in jeopardy if the MRI results reveal an injury significant enough to warrant Kamara missing additional action. Rookie sixth-round pick Devin Neal took over as the Saints' lead back after Kamara got hurt, and Neal would presumably lead New Orleans' backfield in Week 13 at Miami if Kamara isn't available.
</div>

### 🟢 Ricky Pearsall (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Pearsall was held to single-digit yardage for the second consecutive appearance since returning from a six-game absence as the result of a knee injury. At least the 2024 first-round selection got more involved than he was in last week's one-catch, zero-yard outing, garnering three combined touches in the primetime win. It is worth noting that QB Brock Purdy was targeting Pearsall on two of his three interceptions Monday, with one of the passes attempting to connect in the end zone. It is hard to feel confident about the 24-year-old wideout following a pair of duds, but it would be shortsighted for fantasy managers to cut ties at this point. Pearsall possesses elite skills and remains a starter for a high-scoring offense, so better days are surely on the horizon.
