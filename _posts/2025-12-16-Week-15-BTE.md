## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 DJ Moore (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Moore didn't see a big bump in targets even with the continued absence of Rome Odunze (foot), finishing tied for second on the team with five opportunities. However, he delivered splash plays throughout the game to deliver a big fantasy performance. Moore's longest catch of the day went for 25 yards just before halftime, but his most impactful catches were scores of six and 22 yards -- the latter of which was a highlight-reel catch between two defenders. He remains an inconsistent producer, but he has now scored multiple times in two of his last four games while also topping 60 yards in both of those contests.
</div>

### 🟡 Tee Higgins (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 C.J. Stroud (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> A 57-yard TD strike to Nico Collins on the second play of the game set the tone for the rout, and Stroud tossed two more scores -- one to Dalton Schultz in the third quarter and a second to Collins in the fourth -- before the afternoon was over. It's the second time this season Stroud has thrown more than two touchdowns, with the other coming against the Ravens back in Week 5. The third-year QB is keeping the Texans in position for a playoff spot, and he'll take a 15:6 TD:INT through 11 games into another soft matchup against the Raiders in Week 16.
</div>

### 🟢 Juwan Johnson (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Johnson has made at least four catches in five consecutive games, though his 30 receiving yards Sunday marked Johnson's lowest total since Week 6. He ranks second on the team in catches and receiving yards behind Chris Olave. Johnson is likely to maintain his steady pass-catching role in Week 16 against the Jets.
</div>

### 🟢 Tyler Shough (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Shough's only touchdown of the game was a clutch one, as he connected with Chris Olave for the game-tying score with 2:29 remaining. The rookie quarterback then guided the Saints into position for Charlie Smyth's game-winning 47-yard field goal, which Shough helped set up by drawing a 15-yard unnecessary roughness penalty on a scramble during the Saints' penultimate offensive play. Spencer Rattler came in for the next play while Shough was evaluated on the sideline, but Shough was available to speak to the media after the game, suggesting Shough should be fine to take on the Jets in Week 16.
</div>

### 🟢 Devin Singletary (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The veteran RB led the backfield with 102 scrimmage yards and a score in Week 13 prior to the Giants' bye, but Singletary took a back seat to Tyrone Tracy (97 scrimmage yards and two TDs) in this one. Sunday's showing ended a stretch of three straight games in which Singletary had produced at least 40 rushing yards while making three trips to the end zone. He'll look to rebound in Week 16 against the Vikings.
</div>

### 🟢 Breece Hall (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Hall seemed bothered by the knee injury that cut into his practice participation during the week, and he was held to 44 or fewer rushing yards for the third time in four games. Isaiah Davis was the Jets' most effective running back in this lopsided loss, with a 24-yard touchdown run among his 58 rushing yards on nine carries. Hall's inching closer to the 1,000-yard mark on the ground, as he'll need exactly 100 rushing yards to get there in Week 16 at New Orleans.
</div>

### 🟢 Dallas Goedert (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Goedert led the way for the Eagles in receptions, receiving yards, touchdown catches and targets on the afternoon, with both his scores coming on shovel passes near the goal line. The veteran tight end has seen his production ebb and flow this season, but he's on an upswing again after posting a 14-148-2 line on 17 targets over his last two games as a Saturday afternoon Week 16 matchup against a vulnerable Commanders defense approaches.
</div>

### 🟢 Calvin Austin III (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Austin was limited by a calf injury at practice late in the week, but he was ultimately able to play, failing to reel in a pass for the second time in three weeks. With the additions of Adam Thielen and Marquez Valdes-Scantling in recent weeks, Austin's role on the offense has taken a hit, and he has now caught just one of five targets for 31 yards over the last three games.
</div>

### 🟢 Kendrick Bourne (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Bourne jumped back up to third on San Francisco's receiver depth chart while logging 33 snaps on offense (45 percent) Sunday. The 29-year-old also nabbed his first reception since Week 10 after seemingly falling out of favor midseason. If Bourne continues to operate as the 49ers' third receiver down the stretch, then desperate fantasy managers in deeper formats could take a look at the veteran against the Colts next Monday. Especially if starter Ricky Pearsall (ankle/knee) is limited by a couple of minor injuries that cropped up in Week 15's win.
</div>

### 🟢 Jauan Jennings (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jennings was money in the red zone Sunday when he cashed in a pair of short touchdown receptions to bring his season total up to seven. That marks a new career high for the veteran starter, who broke out with a 77-975-6 receiving line in 2024. Jennings has really picked things up in the second half with six touchdowns scored over his last six appearances. With QB Brock Purdy looking as healthy as he has all season, Jennings is primed for a strong finish to the fantasy campaign, starting with next Monday's tilt against the Colts.
</div>

### 🟢 Zach Charbonnet (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Charbonnet was the Seahawks' leading rusher despite finishing with single-digit carries for the fifth time this season. Starter Kenneth Walker continued his recent struggles with an abysmal 9-17-0 rushing line, resulting in no Seattle players averaging over four yards per carry Sunday. Charbonnet has provided a solid baseline for those in deeper fantasy leagues while serving as a touchdown-dependent asset in standard formats for week 16.
</div>

### 🟢 Kenneth Walker III (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Walker managed to sink even deeper than last week's sub-30 yard showing against the Falcons by setting a new low in rushing yards in Sunday's win over the Colts. Zach Charbonnet (8-31-0) didn't fare much better in a game that featured no touchdowns for Seattle. That said, Walker's recent struggles could lead to fewer opportunities in the closing weeks if he can't turn things around against the Rams on Thursday Night Football.
</div>

### 🟢 Terry McLaurin (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Commanders' top wideout was having a quiet day until connecting with Marcus Mariota on a 51-yard score in the fourth quarter. It's McLaurin's second TD in three games since returning from a quadriceps injury, a stretch in which he's posted a 13-216-2 line on 24 targets. Whether Mariota or Jayden Daniels (elbow) is under center in Week 16 against the Eagles, McLaurin figures to be his QB's top downfield option.
