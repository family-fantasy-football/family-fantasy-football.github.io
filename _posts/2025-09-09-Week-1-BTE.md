## Player Report

#### Dalton Kincaid (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Kincaid scored a 15-yard touchdown on the opening drive but was relatively quiet the rest of the way, especially considering Josh Allen ultimately threw for 394 yards. This was nonetheless an encouraging performance from Kincaid, who had only two regular-season touchdowns apiece in the 2023 and 2024 campaigns. Dawson Knox had two catches for 20 yards and rookie fifth-round pick Jackson Hawes also had a 29-yard catch, but Kincaid clearly looks like the top receiving option among Buffalo's tight ends heading into Week 2 against the Jets.
#### DJ Moore (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Moore stayed down after taking a big hit in the fourth quarter but eventually stayed in the game after talking to trainers, as evidenced by his fumble, which came as the Bears were attempting laterals on the game's final play. He occasionally lined up in the backfield in addition to his customary role at wide receiver, so he may handle a few rushing attempts on a weekly basis moving forward. Moore led the Bears in receiving yards each of the past two seasons, so it's no surprise that he topped that category for the team in Monday's season opener. The 28-year-old wide receiver should remain heavily involved Week 2 against the Lions.
#### Roschon Johnson (RB)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Johnson followed up Thursday's listing of DNP on the Bears' practice estimate with no drills Friday before returning as a limited participant at Saturday's session. A foot issue has been bothering him since at least Aug. 7, but the team gave him a chance to suit up in the season opener. With Johnson's lack of availability confirmed for Week 1 action, rookie seventh-rounder Kyle Monangai will be the only active RB behind No. 1 option D'Andre Swift.
#### Tee Higgins (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** The Cincinnati offense had a surprisingly poor opening performance against the Browns, leading to limited production for all of its skill-position players. Higgins led the team in receiving yards thanks to a 13-yard catch as well as a pair of 10-yard gains, but it was still a disappointing showing. He should remain a key part of Cincinnati's offense and will have a chance to bounce back in Week 2 against the Jaguars.
#### Jerome Ford (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Ford was expected to serve as Cleveland's lead back, but he was instead out-touched 20-7 by Dylan Sampson. Ford didn't help himself with his opportunity, as he averaged only 1.3 yards per attempt, with his longest gain on the ground going for only two yards. Things aren't likely to get better for Ford moving forward, as Quinshon Judkins is expected to join the backfield as soon as Week 2 against Baltimore.
#### Christian Kirk (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** questionable
#### C.J. Stroud (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Stroud struggled to finish drives Sunday, leading three lengthy possessions that ended in field-goal attempts. A second-half interception cemented the signal-caller's poor outing and a loss to begin the 2025 campaign. Stroud and his fantasy managers were hoping for a better start after the offense petered out down the stretch last season. Houston will have an extra day to figure things out offensively before hosting the Buccaneers on Monday Night Football in Week 2.
#### J.J. McCarthy (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Making his long-awaited regular-season debut, McCarthy mostly scuffled through the first three quarters before igniting a 21-point outburst in the final period. The 2024 first-round pick connected with Justin Jefferson and Aaron Jones for fourth-quarter touchdown passes of 13 and 27 yards, respectively, and he followed those scoring strikes with a 14-yard touchdown run to extend Minnesota's 20-17 lead at the 2:53 mark of the fourth quarter. McCarthy also completed a two-point conversion to Adam Thielen, and he connected with seven different targets overall when factoring in that scoring toss. The second-year signal-caller now will prepare for his home regular-season debut, a Week 2 matchup against the Falcons on Sunday night.
#### DeMario Douglas (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Douglas' final receiving line was odd to say the least, considering he managed the unlikely feat of recording a touchdown yet finishing with negative yardage overall. The third-year pro saved his day from being a total washout with his two-yard scoring grab late in the first quarter, but the likes of Kayshon Boutte (6-103), Stefon Diggs (6-57) and Hunter Henry (4-66) were all much more involved. It remains to be seen if Week 1 usage will be indicative of a more concentrated Patriots air attack this season, with the next opportunity to see the matter play out coming in the form of a Week 2 road matchup against the Dolphins.
#### Russell Wilson (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Wilson struggled significantly in his New York debut versus the Commanders in Week 1, a 21-6 loss in which he completed 17 of 37 pass attempts for 168 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions. The veteran did salvage his fantasy performance to some extent, rushing for 44 yards on eight carries. While Daboll said the team doesn't want to make any rash decisions at quarterback, Wilson will certainly need to turn in a better effort sooner rather than later in order to avoid pressure from rookie first-round pick Jaxson Dart or potentially even veteran backup Jameis Winston.
#### Breece Hall (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Hall ripped off an 18-yard run on the game's first play, setting the tone for a strong performance on the ground. He was also the team's second-leading receiver behind Garrett Wilson. Braelon Allen had an eight-yard touchdown run but mustered only one yard on five other carries, so Hall's the clear lead back for the Jets heading into a Week 2 home game against the Bills.
#### Dallas Goedert (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Goedert recorded a co-game-high reception total and was second on the Eagles in receiving yards on a night when Jalen Hurts threw for a modest 152 yards. The veteran tight end was peppered with a team-high target tally by Hurts as the Cowboys focused plenty of attention on A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith, leading to a productive start to the campaign for Goedert. He should be involved in a complementary capacity at minimum during a Week 2 road Super Bowl rematch with the Chiefs on Sunday, Sept. 14.
#### Roman Wilson (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Wilson had a minimal role for the Steelers when healthy in 2024, and he was utilized sparingly during Sunday's regular-season opener, playing just 10 offensive snaps in the Steelers' victory. The 2024 third-round pick has yet to be targeted in the NFL, and he could have trouble carving out much fantasy production in 2025 as long as DK Metcalf and Calvin Austin remain healthy.
#### Zach Charbonnet (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The Seahawks opened the 2025 season splitting backfield work between Kenneth Walker and Charbonnet. The latter wound up cashing in Seattle's lone rushing touchdown and finishing with the superior fantasy line. Charbonnet already showed that he can handle an expanded role while filling in for Walker last season, so we could be witnessing the torch being passed to the younger option. Charbonnet provides more fantasy upside over Walker in a timeshare due to his durability and work in the passing game (52 targets in 2024).
#### Kenneth Walker III (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Walker was a limited participant in practice this week dealing with a minor foot injury, but he was left off the injury report ahead of Sunday's kickoff. The veteran starter struggled to gain traction early, ceding 12 carries to Zach Charbonnet in a near-even split of touches. If a true timeshare has finally developed in Seattle, then Walker's fantasy stock would take a hit after he commanded the lion's share of carries when healthy in years past. Assuming this backfield deployment sticks, both tailbacks would generate flex appeal against the Steelers next Sunday.
#### Terry McLaurin (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Perhaps a lack of training camp reps due to an ankle injury and since-resolved contract dispute threw off McLaurin's timing in the season opener, though he also got off to a slow start last season, with just 39 yards through Week 2. McLaurin will try to avoid the same fate Thursday when the Commanders travel to Green Bay. He had a boom-or-bust season in 2024, with four multi-touchdown performances in the regular season, as well as five games with fewer than 30 receiving yards.
