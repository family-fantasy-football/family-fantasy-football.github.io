## Player Report

#### James Conner (RB)
**Injury Status:** Doubtful <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Conner will require surgery after suffering a "severe" ankle injury against San Francisco. The team doesn't yet know the full extent of the injury, but Conner's 2025 seems to be over. With Conner now sidelined, Trey Benson immediately becomes a plug-and-play fantasy starter at running back, and Emari Demercado figures to slide into the mix as the Cardinals' RB2.
#### Zay Flowers (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Flowers once again filled the role of a true No. 1 receiver, leading the way in receptions, receiving yards and targets for the Ravens. While he matched his Week 1 catch total, Flowers didn't come close to approximating his 143-yard tally and didn't get into the end zone. However, Baltimore naturally wasn't pressed to be anywhere near as aggressive through the air as in that season-opening game, and the Flowers-Lamar Jackson connection appears to be in prime form going into a Week 3 home showdown against the Lions on Monday night, Sept. 22.
#### Derrick Henry (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** The offense ran through Lamar Jackson and his pass catchers Sunday, as the star signal-caller finished with four touchdown passes and turned in a turnover-free performance. In contrast, Henry was consistently bottled up, and considering eight of his yards came on one carry, he truly found next to no running room throughout the afternoon. After a spectacular first three-plus quarters of the new season, Henry's fortunes have taken a turn for the worse beginning with his critical fumble in the final quarter of the Week 1 loss to the Bills. His next opportunity to reverse course will come in a Week 3 home interconference clash against the Lions on Monday night, Sept. 22.
#### Josh Allen (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Allen finished with a sparkling 134.1 QB rating in the divisional win, which may have been more tightly contested than initially expected. As a result, the star signal-caller was appreciably more involved through the air than during a comfortable Week 2 win against the Jets, completing passes to nine different targets overall. Allen's first two scoring tosses went to tight ends Dalton Kincaid (20 yards) and Jackson Hawes (five yards), the latter a nifty heave while on the run. Allen closed out his night with a 15-yard strike to Khalil Shakir midway through the fourth quarter to snap a 21-21 tie, and he'll head into a Week 4 home date against the Saints on Sunday, Sept. 28 with an unblemished 5:0 TD:INT and career-best 69.7 percent completion rate through his first three contests.
#### Cedric Tillman (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Tillman, who had 15 targets and two touchdowns through the first two weeks, was kept out of the end zone for the first time and had his fewest targets of the season. The production drop in Week 3 has more to do with Cleveland's sputtering offense and shouldn't be seen as a designed plan to reduce Tillman's role. He's been on the field for 86 percent of the offensive snaps, second only to Jerry Jeudy (86.5 percent) among the Browns wide receivers.
#### Sam LaPorta (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** LaPorta had led the Lions' pass catchers in the Week 1 loss to the Packers, posting a 6-79-0 line on nine targets. LaPorta's numbers were therefore down across the board Sunday, but Jared Goff spread the ball more than he had against Green Bay. LaPorta's production will inevitably fluctuate from game to game given the number of weapons on Detroit, but he'll remain in play for a Week 3 road showdown against the Ravens on Monday night, Sept. 22 that could be a very tightly contested affair.
#### Amon-Ra St. Brown (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** St. Brown comfortably led the Lions in receptions and targets while edging Jameson Williams for the top spot in receiving yards as well. While his speedy teammate got that runner-up spot largely via a 64-yard chunk play, St. Brown chipped away at the Bears secondary throughout the afternoon with short and medium gains, including touchdown grabs of four, eight and four yards. The two-time All-Pro's breakout performance was a welcome departure from his modest 4-45-0 receiving line Week 1 against Green Bay, and St. Brown's contributions figure to be critical again when the Lions tackle the unenviable task of a road trip to Baltimore for a Week 3 Monday night showdown with the Ravens on Sept. 22.
#### Jordan Love (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Love's final stat line -- not to mention the final score -- both hint plenty at what type of day it was for the Packers offense, and additional insight can be gleaned from the fact Love was sacked five times and hit seven times overall. The talented signal-caller had a tight circle of six targets overall in his first full game of 2025 without Jayden Reed (IR-collarbone/foot), and his interception at his own 29-yard line with just over three minutes remaining set the Browns up for a game-tying touchdown. Love has thrown for under 200 yards in two of his first three games, but he takes an impressive 5:1 TD:INT into a Week 4 Sunday night road matchup against the Cowboys.
#### Tucker Kraft (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The knee injury Kraft suffered in Thursday's practice didn't prevent the talented tight end from suiting up, but the Packers' passing game as a whole was frequently overwhelmed by a ferocious Browns defense that brought Jordan Love down five times and picked him off once. Kraft's totals were in stark contrast to his breakout 6-124-1 line against the Commanders in Week 2, but he'll likely be healthier when the Packers pay a visit to the Cowboys for a Week 4 showdown next Sunday night.
#### JuJu Smith-Schuster (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Smith-Schuster saw regular run on offense Sunday with Xavier Worthy (shoulder) out and Rashee Rice suspended, but he was unable to capitalize on the increase in opportunity. With Worthy potentially returning to action this Sunday against the Giants, Smith-Schuster is a candidate to see a reduction in snaps.
#### Keenan Allen (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Allen made a terrific adjustment on a broken play in the fourth quarter, jumping through the defender to snare a 20-yard touchdown that tied the game. If it wasn't clear through the first two weeks, it's obvious now that the veteran is clearly Justin Herbert's preferred target -- especially when a play breaks down -- and the duo's uncanny connection has only become more potent with the emergence of Quentin Johnston (six catches on 10 targets for 89 yards) alongside the reliable Ladd McConkey. Allen has now led the team in targets for three straight weeks and continues to be a key piece of dominant offense.
#### Najee Harris (RB)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** It was clear to the eye that Harris suffered a non-contact Achilles injury, but the team initially labeled it as an ankle issue. Harbaugh added that Harris is undergoing imaging following the win. There's not a lot of optimism that Harris avoided a serious injury, as it looked like a season-ender for the running back. Further tests will reveal the extent of the issue, but Omarion Hampton looks set to pace the Los Angeles backfield moving forward, with Hassan Haskins bumping up the depth chart to RB2. Hampton piled up 129 total yards and one touchdown on 25 touches against Denver and will likely be a locked-in RB1/2 for fantasy purposes moving forward.
#### Sterling Shepard (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Shepard put together his best game of the season, finishing just five yards short of rookie Emeka Egbuka's team-high total. The veteran slot receiver has an 11-153-0 line on 15 targets through Tampa Bay's first three games while taking advantage of the absence of Chris Godwin (ankle), but even if Godwin is ready to make his season debut in Week 4 against the Eagles, Shepard's role may not decrease immediately as Mike Evans left Sunday's win in the fourth quarter with a hamstring injury.
#### Cam Ward (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Ward had a particularly ugly first half, as his second attempted pass of the day was intercepted and returned for a touchdown. That was his only turnover of the day, but he also took four sacks and averaged only 5.8 yards per attempt. Ward did manage to lead two touchdown drives in the second half with the game already out of reach, primarily showing rapport with Chig Okonkwo and Elic Ayomanor -- the latter of whom caught an eight-yard touchdown. Ward has shown glimpses of potential in his last two games, but the Titans' offense remains one of the worst in the league.
#### Jacory Croskey-Merritt (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** The Commanders rolled with a committee in the wake of Austin Ekeler (Achilles) being lost for the season, and Croskey-Merritt scored one of the team's three rushing TDs on the afternoon, with QB Marcus Mariota and Jeremy McNichols getting the others. McNichols' 60-yard touchdown stole the show, but Chris Rodriguez led the backfield with 11 carries, and JCM made his impact with a one-yard plunge in the third quarter. The rookie has 125 rushing yards and two TDs on an impressive 5.7 yards per carry through his first three NFL games, but given the offense's success in this one, he seems unlikely to get a big increase in volume in Week 4 against the Falcons.
