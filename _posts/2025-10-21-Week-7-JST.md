## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Emari Demercado (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Out<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> out
</div>

### 🟡 Michael Penix Jr. (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 Caleb Williams (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Williams' final line underscores the unremarkable performance he authored in the double-digit home win. The 2024 first overall pick averaged 6.6 yards per attempt and generally scuffled against a beatable Saints defense, posting his lowest passing yardage total of the campaign. Williams did connect on another three completions of 20-plus yards, and his 20 such passes on the season over six games are exactly half the tally he generated in that category across 17 regular-season games in 2024. Williams next faces off with an inconsistent Ravens defense on the road in a Week 8 matchup next Sunday afternoon.
</div>

### 🟢 Rome Odunze (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Odunze's target tally led the Bears on the afternoon, and he also finished with the second-highest receiving yardage total on the team. The latter particularly speaks to what a quiet day it was for the passing attack overall, as Caleb Williams threw for only 172 yards. Odunze put together a productive three-game stretch between Weeks 2 and 4 where he posted 14 receptions for 259 yards and four touchdowns, but he's netted just a 4-63-0 line on 11 targets in the subsequent pair of contests. Odunze will next face an inconsistent Ravens defense on the road in a Week 8 matchup next Sunday afternoon.
</div>

### 🟢 D'Andre Swift (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Swift's long run on the day went for a relatively modest 23 yards, underscoring the fact he was able to consistently grind out productive gains throughout the afternoon. The veteran back both eclipsed the 100-yard mark and set a new season high in rushing yards for the second time in six days and went in for his third rushing TD of the season on an 11-yard run with just over nine minutes remaining in the first half. Swift is unsurprisingly proving to be a key cog in head coach Ben Johnson's innovative offense, and he'll take aim at the Ravens' suspect run defense on the road in a Week 8 matchup next Sunday afternoon.
</div>

### 🟢 Travis Kelce (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Kelce looked to be in for a big game, as he made two catches for 51 yards on the Chiefs' first offensive possession, highlighted by a long reception of 44 yards. However, he essentially went silent from there, with the offense instead running through Rashee Rice and several other different pass catchers. Nevertheless, Kelce has over 50 receiving yards in three consecutive games.
</div>

### 🟢 Hunter Henry (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Henry finished second on the team in targets and managed his highest target total since Week 3. He was a reliable option for Drake Maye, helping the Patriots get out from their own goal line with a 12-yard catch early in the second quarter while also converting on third down with an eight-yard reception two quarters later. While he plays a key role in the team's offense, Henry has failed to reach 50 receiving yards in four straight contests.
</div>

### 🟢 Chris Olave (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Olave tied with Juwan Johnson for the team lead in receptions while also setting the pace in receiving yards on the afternoon. The 2022 first-round pick connected with Spencer Rattler for touchdown catches of 21 and 14 yards in the second and third quarter, respectively, and he added a game-long 57-yard reception earlier in the drive that he capped off with his first scoring grab. Olave has been Rattler's most trusted target by far over the first seven games of the season, and the star wideout will head into next Sunday's Week 8 home matchup against the Buccaneers with a robust 44-440-3 line on 71 targets.
</div>

### 🟢 Will Shipley (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Shipley was the second running back on the depth chart Sunday, seeing the field for eight offensive snaps compared to four for Tank Bigsby, with AJ Dillon a healthy scratch. Unless Saquon Barkley gets hurt, however, there won't be enough touches available for any other running back on the team to have fantasy relevance.
</div>

### 🟢 DeVonta Smith (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Smith led the Eagles across the board in receptions, receiving yards and targets with totals that were also season-high figures for the talented receiver. The 2021 first-round pick's yardage tally was additionally a career high, and Smith got there with a big hand from his 79-yard touchdown reception in the second quarter, his second score of the season. Jalen Hurts has been much more active as a passer over the last three games, and Smith has been a beneficiary, posting a 21-346-1 line on 26 targets in that span. Smith next will take aim at the Giants' inconsistent defense in a Week 8 home matchup next Sunday afternoon.
</div>

### 🟢 Jalen Hurts (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Hurts took three sacks, but otherwise he had a near-flawless day that allowed him to finish with a perfect 158.3 passer rating. The reigning Super Bowl MVP had to get aggressive through the air for the third straight game, ultimately setting a new season high in passing yardage yet again after also doing so in Weeks 5 and 6. Hurts was clicking with both of his top receivers, as DeVonta Smith and A.J. Brown accounted for 13 of his completions, 304 of his yards and all three of his touchdown passes. In addition to his 37- and 26-yard scoring strikes to Brown, Hurts also hit the star wideout for a critical 45-yard gain up the left sideline on third down with just under two minutes remaining, a play that would go on to allow Philadelphia to run out the clock. Hurts also connected with Smith for a 79-yard touchdown, the game's longest play through the air, in the third quarter, and the talented signal-caller will head into a Week 8 home rematch with the Giants boasting an 11:1 TD:INT on the campaign.
</div>

### 🟢 Kaleb Johnson (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Johnson recorded six carries in each of the Steelers' last two games, but he was held off the field Thursday night despite being active. Jaylen Warren was dominant in Thursday's loss, racking up 158 yards from scrimmage, while Kenneth Gainwell was on the field for 39 percent of Pittsburgh's offensive snaps, so work likely will continue to be hard to come by for Johnson as long as the team's top two running backs are healthy.
</div>

### 🟢 DK Metcalf (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> On a night when Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins mostly stole the headlines in conjunction with Joe Flacco, Metcalf was almost a forgotten man, even on his own team to an extent. While the star wideout's yardage total was second on the night for the Steelers, he wasn't on the receiving end of any of Aaron Rodgers' quartet of scoring tosses, which all went to tight ends. Nevertheless, Metcalf and Rodgers have already flashed plenty of strong chemistry early on in their working relationship, as evidenced by the 22-406-4 receiving line on 36 targets Metcalf will take into a Week 8 home matchup against the Packers on Sunday night, Oct. 26.
</div>

### 🟢 Christian McCaffrey (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The levee finally broke in terms of McCaffrey's ground game as he cracked the century mark in rushing for the first time this season. It was also the dual-threat superstar's first game with multiple trips to the end zone in 2025, bringing his rushing touchdown total on par with the three receiving scores he has provided fantasy managers so far. McCaffrey also served as the 49ers' leading receiver in a truly dominating performance from start to finish. CMC has been an absolute monster in fantasy this season with over 900 combined yards from scrimmage, making him virtually matchup-proof heading into next Sunday's tilt against a stingy Houston defense.
</div>

### 🟢 Rachaad White (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> White drew another start for Bucky Irving (foot/shoulder) but partly fell victim to game script, as the Lions had jumped out to a 14-3 lead by halftime. White also tied for second in receptions on the night for the Buccaneers, who lost Mike Evans to a concussion and what was ultimately diagnosed as a broken collarbone in the first half. Irving may be ready to return for the Week 8 road matchup against the Saints on Sunday, a development that would relegate White back to his customary No. 2 role.
