## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Bijan Robinson (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> On a night when the usually moribund Falcons offense sprung to life, Robinson was the unit's most prolific all-around contributor yardage-wise among the non-QB skill-position players, narrowly edging out a terrific performance from Kyle Pitts (11-166-3). Robinson also went in for his sixth rushing touchdown of the season from six yards out in the fourth quarter, and he extended his streak of consecutive games with at least 70 rushing yards to six. Robinson's catch total was also a new season high, while his receiving yardage qualified as his third highest of the campaign. The elite back should be teed up for another heavy workload in an appealing Week 16 road matchup against the Cardinals on Sunday, Dec. 21.
</div>

### 🟢 Xavier Legette (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Sunday's loss marked Legette's eighth game of the season with two or fewer receptions, though he still finished with the second-most receiving yards on the Panthers. The second-year pro has now caught 30 of 56 targets for 326 yards and three touchdowns across 12 appearances this year. Offensive consistency issues in Carolina likely make Legette too risky a fantasy option for a Week 16 matchup against the Buccaneers.
</div>

### 🟢 Colston Loveland (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Loveland was involved early, picking up four of his five targets by midway through the second quarter. He recorded the majority of his production on catches of 24 and 19 yards, posting his highest yardage total since Week 9 and the second-highest of his rookie campaign. Loveland continues to get more involved in Chicago's offense, commanding at least five targets in four straight contests.
</div>

### 🟡 Dylan Sampson (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 Jaydon Blue (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The rookie fifth-rounder hasn't played since Week 8 against the Broncos, and his absence will extend to six games after he was made inactive for Sunday night's contest. Blue is unlikely to play unless one of Javonte Williams or Malik Davis misses time.
</div>

### 🟢 Bo Nix (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Nix topped 300 passing yards in a game for the third time this season, highlighted by five completions of at least 20 yards. Two of those went for touchdowns -- including a 23-yard strike over the middle of the field to Troy Franklin as the third quarter expired that gave the Broncos a lead they wouldn't relinquish. He also tacked on a pair of additional touchdown passes from five and 14 yards away to match his season high. Considering the strength of Green Bay's defense, this was one of Nix's most impressive showings of the season, particularly considering he hadn't accounted for multiple scores since Week 9.
</div>

### 🟢 Emanuel Wilson (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Wilson played through a questionable tag but so did starter Josh Jacobs (knee), who had 92 scrimmage yards and two touchdowns on 14 touches to lead Green Bay's backfield as usual. Chris Brooks had two carries for 10 yards and caught one of two targets for six yards as both backups played sparingly. Wilson's role is unlikely to grow as long as Jacobs is available Saturday against the Bears.
</div>

### 🟢 Parker Washington (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Washington returned from a one-game absence and reprised his role as the No. 3 wide receiver behind Brian Thomas and Jakobi Meyers, who each saw seven targets Sunday. With Thomas and Meyers both healthy, Washington isn't expected to play a significant role in Week 16 against the Broncos.
</div>

### 🟢 Brashard Smith (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> While the final score was a 10-point Chiefs loss, the contest remained close enough throughout that KC didn't need to abandon the run until the very end. Thus, Smith saw limited usage, notching just five offensive snaps in the contest. While he continues to be featured a bit as a kick returner, Smith has just one offensive touch to his name over the last two weeks, and there's little to suggest that will change as long as Isiah Pacheco and Kareem Hunt stay healthy.
</div>

### 🟡 Geno Smith (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Smith didn't practice in any capacity Week 15 before being ruled out for Las Vegas' blowout loss to the Eagles. Kenny Pickett will figure to draw another start if Smith is unable to return versus Houston on Sunday. Carroll had previously expressed optimism about Smith's chances of retaking the field Week 16, but it doesn't appear a more substantial update on the veteran quarterback's health will arrive until Wednesday's practice report is released.
</div>

### 🟢 Kyren Williams (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Williams got the Rams' offense cooking with a couple of trips to the end zone in the first half of Sunday's victory. The 24-year-old is now up to 10 rushing touchdowns on the season, giving him double-digits in the category for three consecutive years. Williams also hit the 1,000-yard mark as a rusher Sunday, a feat he has also accomplished in each of his last three campaigns. Blake Corum (11-71-1) remained a factor in his backup role, but Williams is the Rams' clear RB1 for Thursday's pivotal NFC West matchup against the Seahawks.
</div>

### 🟢 Puka Nacua (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Nacua set a new high-water mark for receiving yards in a single game this season just one week after missing his previous mark (170) by three yards against the Cardinals. The budding superstar was balling out so hard against the Lions that he was forced to leave the contest in the fourth quarter due to cramping. Nacua's fantasy managers can exhale knowing that he promptly returned to the field in order to finish off one of the top individual performances in Week 15. The same could not be said for teammate Davante Adams (hamstring), who was forced out of the win with the same injury that had been nagging him in recent weeks. With a short turnaround in Week 16, it wouldn't be surprising if Adams misses Thursday's tilt against the Seahawks. That scenario would lead to Nacua seeing heavy usage while operating as Matthew Stafford's top target in a crucial matchup within the NFC West.
</div>

### 🟢 Tank Bigsby (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> 13 of Bigsby's 17 carries came after the Eagles went up 31-0 at the start of the fourth quarter. He wasn't particularly efficient, averaging 3.4 yards per carry on the day, but his fourth-quarter efforts helped the Eagles to an 11-minute, 22-second drive which killed off the game. Expect his role to shrink again next week if the Eagles aren't up big, as his 27 offensive snaps are equal to his total from the last five games combined.
</div>

### 🟡 Cade Otton (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 Emeka Egbuka (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Egbuka tied for second in receptions while also checking in as the runner-up in receiving yards and targets to the returning Mike Evans. Thursday marked the first time the Buccaneers' top four receivers -- Evans, Egbuka, Chris Godwin and Jalen McMillan -- played together, but Egbuka's target tally took only a slight hit from that of his previous four contests, when he'd drawn between eight and nine looks from Baker Mayfield. Egbuka also recorded multiple catches of 20-plus yards (two) for the first time since Week 10, and he'll aim to continue capitalizing on the reduced defensive attention in a Week 16 road matchup against the Panthers on Sunday, Dec. 21.
</div>

### 🟢 Deebo Samuel (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Marcus Mariota completed only 10 passes in total on the day, with Samuel and Terry McLaurin the only players to catch more than one of them, but Samuel's longest gain went for only 18 yards. The veteran wideout has hauled in multiple passes in every game he's played this season, and his 65 receptions through 13 contests are already the second-highest total of his career after his 77 in 2021 with the 49ers. Samuel will look for his first TD since Week 11 in a Week 16 clash with the Eagles.
