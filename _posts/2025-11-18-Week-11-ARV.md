## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Bijan Robinson (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Robinson put together a signature performance, recording four- and one-yard touchdown runs in the first half. Robinson's yardage marked his third occasion over the century mark this season, and his first multi-TD game on the ground as well. The third-year pro's carry total was also a new season high, affording him plenty of momentum heading into a Week 12 road matchup against the Saints. Robinson could be leaned on even more than usual in that game if Michael Penix (knee) is unavailable.
</div>

### 🟡 Xavier Legette (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> According to Joe Person of The Athletic, Legette sustained a hip injury on the Panthers' final drive of the fourth quarter and didn't play in the overtime period. However, he still finished as Carolina's second-leading receiver, highlighted by a 36-yard touchdown from Bryce Young in the third quarter that pulled the Panthers within one score. The second-year pro remains an integral part of Carolina's offense, catching 24 of 46 targets for 264 yards and three touchdowns across nine appearances this season. The extent of Legette's hip injury remains unclear, but if he's able to suit up in Week 12, he'll draw a favorable matchup against the 49ers.
</div>

### 🟢 Colston Loveland (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Loveland was outproduced slightly by Cole Kmet (five catches on five targets for 45 yards), as the two tight ends were two of three players to reach 40 receiving yards for the Bears, along with Rome Odunze (two catches for 41 yards on six targets). Loveland's impact in the passing game has grown in recent weeks, but Chicago has also shifted to a more run-first approach during that stretch. The rookie 10th overall pick has 213 receiving yards in his last three games heading into Chicago's Week 12 home game against the Steelers.
</div>

### 🟢 Dylan Sampson (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Sampson had fewer snaps (six) than fellow backup Jerome Ford (13 snaps, one touch), but overall the recent trend has been that Sampson is Cleveland's No. 2 back for fantasy purposes. Regardless, both Ford and Sampson sit well behind Quinshon Judkins in the backfield pecking order.
</div>

### 🟢 Jaydon Blue (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> 
</div>

### 🟢 Bo Nix (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> It was the first time all season Nix had failed to produce a TD, but his 295 passing yards were his highest total since Week 4, and the second-year QB came through when it mattered most, hitting Troy Franklin for a 32-yard gain inside the final minute of the fourth quarter to set up Wil Lutz's game-winning FG. Nix will head into the Broncos' Week 12 bye riding an eight-game win streak that has them firmly in control of the AFC West, two games ahead of the Chargers and four wins clear of KC.
</div>

### 🟡 Kalif Raymond (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Raymond is dealing with cramps in the fourth quarter. He wasn't targeted prior to the injury on a tough night for Detroit's offense, but Raymond contributed two kickoff returns for 36 yards and three punt returns for three yards on special teams.
</div>

### 🟢 Parker Washington (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The 2023 sixth-round pick entered Sunday's contest with 15 catches for 175 yards and a touchdown over the previous three games, but Washington was minimally involved in the passing game versus Los Angeles despite leading Jacksonville's wideouts with 54 offensive snaps. Quarterback Trevor Lawrence attempted just 22 passes, with Jakobi Meyers being the only pass catcher with more than three receptions or 25 receiving yards. No. 1 wideout Brian Thomas (ankle) was inactive after being labeled questionable, and his impending return should only further reduce Washington's involvement.
</div>

### 🟢 Geno Smith (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> In the two games coming out of Las Vegas' bye week, Smith posted a four-score outing followed up by last week's forgettable showing against Denver (143 yards, INT). The veteran signal-caller presented a version of himself on Monday Night Football that falls right in between his recent Jekyll and Hyde performances. Smith used garbage time to pad his stats while tossing his 12th touchdown pass and 13th interception of the season. The 34-year-old's inconsistent play coupled with a matchup against the league's stingiest defense (167.0 passing yards allowed per game) make Smith a poor fantasy play against the Browns in Week 12.
</div>

### 🟢 Kyren Williams (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Most of Williams' production came in the first quarter, as he had a two-yard rushing touchdown sandwiched between runs of 30 and 34 yards. He was significantly more effective on a per-touch basis than Blake Corum, who turned nine touches into just five scrimmage yards. Corum has siphoned off 11.5 carries per game in the last four, but Williams remains the lead back in an excellent Rams offense, keeping Williams' fantasy value high heading into a Week 12 home game against the Buccaneers.
</div>

### 🟢 Puka Nacua (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Nacua accounted for 75 of Matthew Stafford's 130 passing yards as the Rams' prolific passing offense slowed down Sunday. Davante Adams caught his seventh receiving touchdown in the past four games, but Nacua remains the top overall target for Stafford, who has a 22:0 TD:INT in his last seven starts. Nacua has accrued at least 85 scrimmage yards in seven of nine appearances heading into a Week 12 home game against the Buccaneers on SNF.
</div>

### 🟢 Tank Bigsby (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Bigsby's stat line wasn't particularly impressive, but both his carries and yards represent his second-best numbers since joining the Eagles via trade after Week 1. It would take an injury to Saquon Barkley for Bigsby to become a significant part of the Eagles' gameplan.
</div>

### 🟢 Cade Otton (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Otton checked into Sunday's game riding a productive five-game run where he'd generated a 29-319-0 line on 37 targets, so his downturn against the Bills was significant. Baker Mayfield ultimately threw for only 173 yards against a tough Buffalo pass defense, however, putting Otton's modest numbers into better context. The talented tight end could have a chance to bounce back in a Week 12 road showdown against the Rams on Sunday night, considering Tampa Bay figures to have to remain aggressive to keep pace with Sean McVay's potent offense.
</div>

### 🟢 Emeka Egbuka (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Egbuka finished with team-high reception and target totals while finishing second in receiving yards. The rookie was the subject of heavy attention from the Bills' defense in the ongoing absences of Mike Evans (IR, collarbone/concussion), Chris Godwin (fibula) and Bucky Irving (shoulder/foot), helping lead to his second sub-50-yard tally in the last three games. Egbuka will remain in an elevated role in a Week 12 road showdown against the Rams next Sunday night.
</div>

### 🔴 Calvin Ridley (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Out<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> In his first game back after missing time with a hamstring injury, Ridley suffered a season-ending injury. In his looming absence,  Elic Ayomanor, Chimere Dike and Van Jefferson are next up for the Titans' WR targets, though as Week 12 approaches, Dike is dealing with a chest contusion and Ayomanor a hamstring issue, per Terry McCormick of TitanInsider.com.
</div>

### 🟢 Deebo Samuel (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The veteran wideout scored Washington's only TD of the day on a 20-yard catch-and-run in the third quarter. Samuel has gotten into the end zone in back-to-back games, and he'll take a 53-470-5 line on 68 targets for the season into the Commanders' Week 12 bye. He's also chipped in 52 yards and a touchdown on the ground.
