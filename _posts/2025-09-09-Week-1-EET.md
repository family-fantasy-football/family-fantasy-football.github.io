## Player Report

#### Trey Benson (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The second-year back led Arizona in rushing thanks to a 52-yard scamper around right end on the team's first drive of the second half. James Conner saw 12 carries but gained only 39 yards, with his longest run going for 12, and the split both of touches and of production bodes well for Benson as the season moves forward. He'll look to continue carving out a significant role in the offense at home Week 2 against the Panthers.
#### Tyler Allgeier (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The No. 2 back finished with just two fewer carries than star backfield mate Bijan Robinson, who was similarly stymied on the ground. However, Robinson also logged seven targets and finished with 100 receiving yards, while Allgeier did not see the ball come his way through the air. Robinson is expected to see an even bigger role in his third season, but Allgeier should still have at least an outside chance at double-digit carries in most games.
#### Drake London (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** As his final numbers corroborate, London had an exceedingly busy day in the season-opening division clash, but his absence on a drive that ended in a missed field goal by Younghoe Koo loomed large. London also was contained to plenty of short-area work when he was in the game, with the Buccaneers naturally having plenty of experience in defending him at this point in his career. London's status for a Week 2 road matchup against the Vikings next Sunday night will remain clouded for now, but further clarity will be gleaned on his condition in the coming days.
#### Justice Hill (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Hill had a healthy 45% snap share but his usage was minimal as he had just four combined opportunities in 23 snaps. He had a mishap on one of his carries that resulted in a fumble, and also had a target slip through his hands.  Hill seems to be locked into a role as the passing down back who should see his share of targets as the season progresses -- he caught 42 passes in 2024 -- but rushing work will likely remain light. The Ravens host the Browns in Week 2.
#### Dak Prescott (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Prescott spearheaded the upset-minded Cowboys through a productive first two quarters that had Dallas up by a 14-7 margin at one point. The initial two drives culminated in Javonte Williams rushing touchdowns, and Prescott played mistake-free football while frequently focusing on top target CeeDee Lamb. However, Prescott and new addition George Pickens had some trouble connecting in their first game together -- albeit because of defensive pass interference in one instance -- and Lamb then failed to find the handle on a couple of the quarterback's throws in the fourth quarter, including on a perfectly thrown fourth-down lob down the left side of the field that Lamb dove for but couldn't secure. Prescott and Pickens will have some extra time to build chemistry ahead of the Cowboys' Week 2 game, which will be their home opener against the Giants on Sunday, Sept. 14.
#### Courtland Sutton (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Sutton was unsurprisingly Bo Nix's favorite target and led the Broncos in targets, receptions and yards. Sutton accounted for the majority of his production on a leaping, contested 22-yard touchdown catch just before halftime. He chipped in two additional receptions that went for double-digit gains to get his 2025 campaign off to a solid start.
#### Hollywood Brown (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Brown led the Chiefs in receptions, receiving yards and targets, and Xavier Worthy's exit from the game on the third play from scrimmage due to a shoulder injury certainly played a part in the former's boost in opportunity. While Brown's mostly short-area role left him just short of the 100-yard mark despite the significant catch volume, he did record a game-long 49-yard reception. Brown's chemistry with Patrick Mahomes was certainly encouraging after the veteran wideout missed the majority of the 2024 regular season due to a sternoclavicular injury, and his hefty workload could come close to being replicated in a Super Bowl LIX home rematch with the Eagles on Sunday, Sept. 14 if Worthy is sidelined for that game.
#### Jakobi Meyers (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Facing his old squad, Meyers finished with team-leading reception and target totals while checking in just behind Brock Bowers (knee) in receiving yards. The veteran wideout displayed an encouraging rapport with new quarterback Geno Smith, and Meyers' final line was a signature one for a receiver that's made his living in the league excelling in the short- and medium-range passing windows. Meyers should be very busy again during a Week 2 home divisional showdown with the Chargers on Monday night, Sept. 15.
#### Darren Waller (TE)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** questionable
#### Rashid Shaheed (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The fourth-year wideout saw strong volume in new coach Kellen Moore's scheme, but Shaheed was actually the Saints' third-most productive pass catcher behind TE Juwan Johnson (8-76 on 11 targets) and WR Chris Olave (7-54 on 13 targets). With Spencer Rattler chucking up a career-high 46 pass attempts in a game that remained close throughout, the ceiling for the team's aerial attack might be higher than expected despite the question marks at quarterback. Shaheed will look to turn his volume into a  big gain or two at home in Week 2 against the 49ers.
#### Tyrone Tracy Jr. (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Tracy failed to find any running room, though Devin Singletary and rookie fourth-round pick Cam Skattebo were even worse, with a combined six rushing yards on five carries. Poor offensive play could limit the Giants' offense all season, but Tracy at least looks like the team's clear lead back to begin his second NFL season. Tracy will try to bounce back in Week 2 against the Cowboys.
#### Brock Purdy (QB)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Coach Kyle Shanahan revealed Monday that Purdy suffered a pair of injuries during Sunday's victory in Seattle. The toe issue is worse than the shoulder concern, per David Lombardi of SFStandard.com, which is to his non-throwing arm. Purdy was able to play all 76 offensive snaps and completed 26 of 35 passes for 277 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions and turned five carries into 17 yards. If Purdy needs to miss any time, Mac Jones is waiting in the wings for spot starts.
#### George Kittle (TE)
**Injury Status:** Out <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Coach Kyle Shanahan relayed during Monday's media session that Kittle was expected to miss a "few weeks," according to David Lombardi of SFStandard.com. If the timeline that Rapoport put forth is more accurate, though, Kittle would be a candidate to be placed on injured reserve, which would require at least four games on the sideline. For as long as Kittle is out, Luke Farrell and Jake Tonges will serve as San Francisco's tight ends.
#### Tony Pollard (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Pollard predictably dominated work out of the Tennessee backfield, accounting for 18 of the team's 21 rushing attempts. He was unable to find much room to run, as he managed a long gain of only nine yards on the ground while averaging just 3.3 yards per attempt with a lost fumble. Pollard's biggest impact of the game came on a 29-yard catch on Tennessee's first possession that ultimately set up a field goal. While his stat line wasn't particularly impressive, Pollard should have a very safe workload heading into a Week 2 matchup against the Rams.
