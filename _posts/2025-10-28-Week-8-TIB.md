## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟡 Kyler Murray (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 Darnell Mooney (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Drake London (hip) was a surprise inactive after being placed on the injury report Saturday, but Mooney and fill-in signal-caller Kirk Cousins were unable to connect until the latter portion of the contest. The disappointing showing featured a season-low receiving yardage total for Mooney, who now has two one-catch tallies in his last three appearances heading into a Week 9 road matchup against a tough Patriots defense.
</div>

### 🟢 Kyle Pitts Sr. (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Pitts led the Falcons in receptions, receiving yards and targets on the afternoon, as the absence of Drake London (hip) opened up plenty of extra opportunity. Pitts was the only Atlanta pass catcher to truly take advantage, however, working seamlessly with fill-in signal-caller Kirk Cousins on his way to a season-high catch total. After multiple seasons of what has been perceived as underutilization in the passing attack, Atlanta's coaching staff is seemingly prioritizing keeping Pitts involved, as he'll take a 39-344-1 receiving line on 47 targets into a Week 9 road matchup against the Patriots.
</div>

### 🟢 Mark Andrews (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> He didn't see much volume with Tyler Huntley under center in place of Lamar Jackson (hamstring), but Andrews did have one big gain in the second quarter with a 24-yard reception that helped set up a field goal. The 34 yards on the afternoon actually represented his second-best total of the season, and Andrews has delivered a 24-208-2 line on 30 targets through seven contests. If Jackson returns in Week 9, his long-time chemistry with Andrews could boost the veteran tight end's numbers on the road against the Dolphins.
</div>

### 🟢 Keon Coleman (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Coleman finished a distant second to Khalil Shakir in receptions, receiving yards and targets, turning in his sixth straight sub-50-yard effort following his 112-yard tally against the Ravens in Week 1. The second-year wideout is averaging just 9.9 yards per reception and has taken just three of his 27 catches for 20-plus yards, a sharp contrast to the outstanding 19.2 yards per grab he averaged as a rookie in the 2024 regular season. Coleman will aim to make a bigger impact in a Week 9 home showdown against the Chiefs next Sunday afternoon.
</div>

### 🟢 Tetairoa McMillan (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> McMillan was essentially the lone bright spot for the Panthers in the embarrassing loss, easily leading Carolina across the board in receptions, receiving yards and targets. The rookie first-round pick showed good chemistry with Andy Dalton, and the talented wideout's catch total was a new career high while his target tally tied his high-water mark over the first eight games. McMillan should remain busy in a Week 9 road trip to Green Bay, a game in which the Panthers may have to eventually take a pass-centric approach.
</div>

### 🟢 Javonte Williams (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Williams scored a pair of one-yard rushing touchdowns to bring his season total to eight rushing scores, but Dallas otherwise failed to find the end zone against the stout Denver defense until after waving the white flag and inserting backup quarterback Joe Milton. Williams, the former Broncos running back, continues to dominate touches in Dallas' backfield, especially once top backup Miles Sanders (knee) was ruled out for the season. Williams and the Cowboys host the Cardinals on Monday Night Football in Week 9.
</div>

### 🟡 Marvin Mims Jr. (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Mims was injured late in the win over Dallas. Prior to getting hurt, the 2023 second-round pick didn't catch his only target and rushed three times for 18 yards. He also had three kickoff returns for 93 yards, two punt returns for 26 yards and drew a 32-yard defensive pass interference penalty. Mims will need to clear concussion protocol to have a chance to play in Week 9 against the Texans.
</div>

### 🟢 Josh Jacobs (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jacobs was headed towards his worst fantasy performance of the season before punching in a touchdown late in the fourth quarter on Sunday Night Football. Green Bay's workhorse was held to 2.5 yards per carry, opening the door for backup Emanuel Wilson to lead the team with 61 rushing yards on 11 attempts. Jacobs was dealing with a calf injury during the practice week, which could help explain his poor efficiency in Sunday's victory. The late score extended Jacobs' touchdown streak to four games, rewarding fantasy managers with seven trips to the end zone over that span. Assuming he escaped this contest unscathed, Jacobs should be treated as an elite asset in a soft matchup against the Panthers next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Nick Chubb (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Chubb received six more carries than rookie backfield mate Woody Marks, but the latter outgained the veteran by six yards despite the lesser workload. Marks also stood out by doubling Chubb's reception total and gaining 36 more receiving yards, but head coach DeMeco Ryans appears intent on keeping Chubb involved as both a runner and receiver. Nevertheless, with a middling 4.0 yards-per-carry average, Chubb could eventually swap places in the backfield pecking order with Marks.
</div>

### 🟢 Quentin Johnston (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Johnston was on the field for 38 of 73 offensive snaps, trailing Tre' Harris (43) and Ladd McConkey (42) but finishing well ahead of Keenan Allen (18). Harris has an overlapping skill set with Johnston, and the rookie second-round pick could gradually supplant Johnston as the team's go-to deep threat. Johnston exceeded 70 receiving yards in each of his first four appearances this season while scoring four touchdowns over that span, but he has just 70 yards and one touchdown in his last three games combined. His next opportunity to bounce back will arrive against the Titans in Week 9.
</div>

### 🟢 Carson Wentz (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Injured Reserve<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Wentz played the majority of snaps in Minnesota's last five games with J.J. McCarthy (ankle) working his way back from a multi-week injury, but the veteran was clearly playing through pain during last Thursday's 37-10 loss to the Chargers. Per Dane Mizutani of the St. Paul Pioneer Press, the Vikings have officially placed Wentz on IR. The transaction confirms that McCarthy will start Sunday's road matchup against the Lions, if healthy, and leaves Max Brosmer in position to handle No. 2 quarterback duties for Minnesota.
</div>

### 🟢 Theo Johnson (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Johnson has scored four touchdowns in his last five games, but the Eagles managed to keep him out of the end zone in both meetings over that span. Fellow Giants tight end Daniel Bellinger exited due to a neck injury, which could open up more targets for Johnson if Bellinger doesn't return in Week 9 against the 49ers.
</div>

### 🟢 Justin Fields (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Glenn praised Fields' performance during Sunday's 39-38 win over the Bengals, saying he "managed the game really well," while also noting that "there are still some things within that game that [Fields] knows he has to improve on." Still, Glenn did not reveal whether Fields or Tyrod Taylor will start under center at home against the Browns on Sunday, Nov. 9. Taylor seemed to be trending toward the start versus Cincinnati prior to being ruled out with a knee injury, but Fields' performance may have been sufficient to earn him further time in the No. 1 seat. Whoever is under center Week 10 could benefit from the return of WR Garrett Wilson (knee).
</div>

### 🔴 Chris Godwin Jr. (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Out<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> out
