## Player Report

#### D'Andre Swift (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Swift dealt with a quadriceps injury during the practice week before ultimately being cleared for action Sunday. The 25-year-old dominated the backfield touches, but his 15 combined touches resulted in just 40 total yards. Swift has averaged well under four yards per carry in five of his last six contests with only one trip to the end zone over that span. Things won't get any easier for the Bears' offense as they prepare for a road tilt against Minnesota next Monday.
#### Joe Burrow (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Burrow was spectacular in front of a national audience Monday, but he actually came out victorious after dropping the Bengals last three games with similar performances. The soon-to-be 28-year-old only faltered on an errant pass to Ja'Marr Chase in the second half that was picked off by a Cowboys defender. Burrow now carries gaudy season totals of 3,706 passing yards to go along with 33 touchdowns (six picks) through 13 games. The fantasy stud gets a soft matchup against the Titans on Sunday for what likely will be an important playoff matchup for his managers.
#### Devaughn Vele (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Vele's Week 13 performance was a major disappointment considering rookie quarterback Bo Nix threw for 294 yards against the Browns. Operating as the No. 2 wideout, Vele played 31 of the Broncos' 66 offensive snaps Monday, second only to Courtland Sutton's 62. The rookie will look to bounce back against the Colts on Dec. 15 when the Broncos return from their Week 14 bye.
#### Jameson Williams (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Williams led the team in receiving yards on a team-high eight targets, most notably reeling in a 28-yard catch in the first quarter. The wide receiver's dynamic skill set has led to some big performances this season, and the five catches matched his season high, which he now has accomplished in three straight games and five times overall in 2024. On the year, Williams has caught 39 of 63 targets for 710 yards and four touchdowns while appearing in 11 games.
#### Ameer Abdullah (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Abdullah earned just two touches despite playing 39 percent of the Raiders' offensive snaps, ceding much of the backfield work to Sincere McCormick as the undrafted 24-year-old took 15 carries for 78 yards to go along with a pair of receptions for another 11 yards. Abdullah figures to take a backseat to McCormick again in Week 15 when Las Vegas hosts the Falcons on Monday Night Football. Additionally, Alexander Mattison (ankle) and Zamir White (quadriceps) could return to the backfield rotation as well.
#### Ladd McConkey (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** questionable
#### Demarcus Robinson (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Robinson missed much of the third quarter Sunday against the Bills due to a shoulder injury but was able to return to action. On Monday, coach Sean McVay clarified the nature of Robinson's health concern, calling it an AC joint sprain, per Adam Grosbard of The Orange County Register. With a DNP to kick off Week 15 prep, Robinson now will have a maximum of two chances to prove his health ahead of Thursday's game at San Francisco.
#### Matthew Stafford (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Despite the score and the stat line of Josh Allen, the Rams prioritized their running game. That limited Stafford's passing volume, but he made up for that by averaging 10.7 yards per attempt while completing four passes of more than 20 yards. He also found the end zone on passes of 17 and 19 yards to Puka Nacua and Cooper Kupp, respectively. Stafford now has multiple scores in four straight games with no interceptions, though this was his first 300-yard performance since Week 1.
#### Tyreek Hill (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Hill and Jaylen Waddle posted identical first-half stat lines of five catches for 61 yards, and they ultimately accounted for 214 of Tua Tagovailoa's 331 passing yards as the Dolphins capitalized on the absence of star Jets cornerback Sauce Gardner (hamstring). Hill's four-yard touchdown catch followed by a two-point conversion to Waddle helped Miami tie the game 23-23 with 9:04 to play in regulation. Despite playing through a wrist injury in recent weeks, Hill has been heating up. The speedster has scored in four of the past five games, and Hill has topped 80 receiving yards in each of his last two outings ahead of a Week 15 road game against the Texans after reaching that mark only twice through Week 12.
#### Aaron Jones (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** A week after having issues with ball security, Jones turned in a clean performance that also featured his third performance of better than 70 rushing yards in the last five contests. Jones also recorded his second rushing touchdown in the last three games on a 15-yard run with 3:38 remaining to cap off the runaway win.  The veteran back heads into a Week 15 home matchup against the Bears on Monday night, Dec. 16 now just 117 rushing yards away from the fourth 1,000-yard campaign of his career.
#### Hunter Henry (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The veteran tight end once again led the Patriots in catches, targets and receiving yards, but Henry got denied a bigger performance when Austin Hooper caught Drake Maye's only TD of the day in the second quarter instead. Henry is on the verge of a career-best campaign, needing just three more catches and 43 more yards to set new personal bests in those categories. He'll aim for those marks on the other side of New England's Week 14 bye.
#### Marquez Valdes-Scantling (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The veteran wideout led the Saints in receiving yards, just nudging out Juwan Johnson's 50, but it was the tight end who caught Derek Carr's only TD. The QB left the game late in the fourth quarter to be checked out for a concussion and a hand injury, and while Valdes-Scantling has an 11-283-4 line on 17 targets over the last four games, he'll likely have trouble finding the same success in Week 15 against the Commanders if Jake Haener or Spencer Rattler is under center for the Saints instead of Carr.
#### Malik Nabers (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** While it wasn't an efficient performance, Nabers led the Giants in receiving yards and tied for the team lead in catches with Tyrone Tracy and Daniel Bellinger. Nabers hasn't gotten into the end zone since Week 3, but the rookie wideout has caught at least five passes in six straight games despite the team's QB turmoil, posting a 41-392-0 line on 66 targets. Nabers will try to take advantage of an exploitable secondary in Week 15 against the Ravens.
#### Najee Harris (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** The Steelers had a mediocre day offensively, with nearly all of their skill-position players posting modest stat lines. Harris was no exception, as he managed only 3.3 yards per carry despite tallying a 20-yard gain for the second consecutive game. Even with the inefficiency, Harris still managed a decent fantasy performance thanks to a one-yard touchdown run early in the second quarter. Since Russell Wilson has taken over under center, Harris has four trips to the end zone in seven contests, though he's failed to reach 80 yards on the ground in five straight matchups.
#### George Kittle (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Kittle played like a man possessed against the Bears after recording just one reception for seven yards the week prior. Weather played a huge role in the road stinker against Buffalo, so Sunday's sunny conditions allowed the star tight end to feast on Chicago's defense. Kittle upped his season line to 56-800-8 in the much-needed win, confirming the tight end's upper-echelon status in fantasy ahead of Thursday's primetime tilt against the Rams.
#### Brock Purdy (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Purdy did suffer an injury scare in the fourth quarter on a roughing the passer penalty that saw the quarterback's body bend backward in an awkward fashion between two Chicago defenders. The star QB was writhing in pain on the ground following the hit, but he wound up missing just one play before returning to the field, as reported by 49ers' reporter Cam Inman. Aside from the brief injury scare, Purdy was firing on all cylinders against the scuttling Bears, which comes as a relief to fantasy managers following last week's dud against the Bills in the snow. Assuming that there are no lingering effects from getting clotheslined Sunday, Purdy could be in store for another high score in a potential shootout against the Rams on Thursday Night Football in Week 15.
#### Nick Westbrook-Ikhine (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Westbrook-Ikhine has been reliant upon big plays all season, though he had been carving out a bigger role in the Tennessee offense by commanding at least five targets in three straight games. He took a step back in Sunday's loss, drawing his lowest target count since Week 6. Westbrook-Ikhine should have the chance to rebound in Week 15 against the Bengals, though the state of the Titans' offense will leave him as a boom-or-bust option down the stretch.
