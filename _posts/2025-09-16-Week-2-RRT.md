## Player Report

#### Trey McBride (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** McBride finished as the Cardinals' leading receiver after ceding that honor to WR Marvin Harrison in Week 1. The 25-year-old McBride has racked up six receptions in each of his two starts so far, putting him on pace for another 100-plus reception season following last year's breakout 111-catch campaign. McBride's allergy to the end zone (career high of three TDs in 2023) is what holds him back from breaking the fantasy stratosphere. The Colorado State product is still a PPR monster and a TE1 play against the 49ers next Sunday.
#### DeAndre Hopkins (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Hopkins has been much more of a short-area target over the last few seasons, but the veteran flashed his downfield chops on both his catches Sunday. Hopkins nearly had a touchdown on his first grab, which covered 41 yards early in the third quarter and was originally ruled a score before replay review revealed Hopkins hadn't broken the plane of the goal line. There was no ambiguity on his second and final reception of the night, a 23-yard scoring grab with just under five minutes remaining that closed out Baltimore's scoring on the day. Hopkins has taken half of his first four catches in a Ravens uniform for touchdowns, affording him some momentum heading into a Week 3 home matchup against the Lions on Monday night, Sept. 22.
#### Chuba Hubbard (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Hubbard salvaged another pedestrian rushing performance with a late receiving touchdown in the Panthers' second loss of the season. The 26-year-old starter snuck out of the backfield for a five-yard score in the fourth quarter, also scoring the ensuing two-point attempt for good measure. Hubbard continues to dominate the backfield touches in Carolina, making him a starting level fantasy option heading into next Sunday's tilt against Atlanta.
#### Ja'Marr Chase (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Chase struggled in Week 1 against the Browns along with the rest of the Bengals' offense. However, he bounced back in a big way in Week 2, doubling up Tee Higgins in targets while accounting for over half of the team's yards through the air. His touchdown came from four yards away early in the first quarter, and he then tacked on receptions of 25, 16, 14 and 13 yards. Even more impressive was that the majority of Chase's production came with Jake Browning under center after Joe Burrow departed in the second quarter with an apparent toe injury. If Burrow is sidelined for an extended period, Chase's production would likely dip, but his talent and role will keep him locked in as a top option at wide receiver.
#### David Montgomery (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Montgomery and backfield mate Jahmyr Gibbs each recorded a rushing touchdown, and Montgomery also had just one fewer carry than his star teammate, albeit while compiling 37 fewer rushing yards. Montgomery still averaged 5.2 yards per carry, however, and he rang up his first TD of the season on a one-yard run late in the first quarter. Through two games, it appears the backs will continue to operate in a fairly close timeshare, but they face a thorny matchup in a Week 3 road trip to face the Ravens on Monday night, Sept. 22.
#### Dalton Schultz (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Schultz turned in another mild fantasy score despite finishing second in targets for the Texans. The veteran starter provides predictability for those in deeper formats, but his lack of upside and scoring potential (two touchdowns over 17 starts in 2024) keep him from flourishing in fantasy circles. Schultz remains a low-end option heading into a Week 3 matchup against the Jaguars on Sunday.
#### Josh Downs (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Downs wasn't prioritized in the Colts' Week 1 offense, though he led the team in both targets and receptions in Week 2. He was busy early in the game, as he recorded two receptions for 29 yards on the team's first four offensive plays. Tyler Warren has quickly emerged as Daniel Jones' favorite target, leaving Downs as likely to rotate productive games with the likes of Michael Pittman and Alec Pierce.
#### Travis Etienne Jr. (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Etienne went a long way toward proving his breakout Week 1 performance was no fluke, as he averaged 5.1 yards per carry while comfortably pacing the Jaguars in rush attempts and rushing yards. The versatile veteran also made his mark as a receiver via an 11-yard touchdown catch with just over four minutes remaining in the third quarter, his first score of any kind in the new season. With ex-backfield mate Tank Bigsby now in Philadelphia, Etienne looks entrenched as the clear-cut No. 1 back in head coach Liam Coen's productive offense going into a Week 3 home divisional matchup against the Texans next Sunday.
#### Matthew Stafford (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Stafford wasn't sharp in the first half, totaling only 106 yards while also throwing an interception just before halftime that set up a field goal for Tennessee. However, he completed three passes of at least 20 yards in the second half -- the longest of which was a 40-yard pass to Jordan Whittington -- and also capped two drives with touchdown passes of eight and 16 yards, respectively. Stafford has not appeared limited by a back injury that drew a lot of attention in the preseason, as he has averaged 8.8 yards per attempt with three touchdowns across two games.
#### Rhamondre Stevenson (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Stevenson set a new career high in receiving yards, fueled by a 55-yard reception in the third quarter. He operated as the lead back while rookie second-round pick TreVeyon Henderson and Antonio Gibson combined for eight carries and three targets, though Gibson also contributed a kickoff return touchdown on special teams. Stevenson is the team's preferred option on early downs, and he could hold off the alternatives in passing situations if he continues to shine as a pass catcher like he did Sunday. The 27-year-old running back's fantasy value is trending up ahead of a Week 3 home game against a Steelers run defense that has struggled to begin the season.
#### Spencer Rattler (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The second-year quarterback kept the Saints in the game with TD tosses Juwan Johnson in the second quarter, Rashid Shaheed in the third and Devaughn Vele in the fourth, but Rattler's attempt at a game-winning drive in the final three minutes stalled out around midfield. The three scores were a career high for the QB, who tossed only four in seven games as a rookie. Perhaps more impressive is the fact he's gone two straight starts without committing a turnover to begin 2025. Rattler will try to get his team into the win column in Week 3 against the Seahawks.
#### A.J. Brown (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** This was certainly an improvement over last week's one-catch showing, but the end result was still poor from a fantasy perspective. DeVonta Smith (4-53-0) finished as the Eagles' leading receiver with Brown leading the team in targets (eight) and receptions (five). Philadelphia's run-heavy offense to kick off the 2025 season is the main culprit for the entire receiving corps posting paltry totals through two games. Perhaps Brown and the rest of the Eagles' aerial attack will finally take off in what could be a high-scoring affair against the Rams next Sunday.
#### Brian Robinson Jr. (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Robinson struggled to find much running room with his allotted touches Sunday. The 26-year-old wound up playing 16 snaps on offense (23 percent) and was still the only backup runner deployed behind Christian McCaffrey. Robinson will continue serving a change-of-pace role for the 49ers against the Cardinals next Sunday.
#### Cooper Kupp (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Kupp bounced back from a two-catch Seahawks debut but once again finished second on the team in receiving yards behind Jaxon Smith-Njigba. Kupp and JSN combined for 19 targets while no other teammate had more than four, but Sam Darnold's first two touchdown passes of the season went to Tory Horton and AJ Barner. Up next for Seattle's new-look passing game is a Week 3 home game against the Saints.
#### Sam Darnold (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Darnold threw a 21-yard touchdown pass to Tory Horton on the opening drive, but Seattle failed to score on any of its other five first-half possessions, two of which ended in Darnold interceptions. He found success again at the start of the second half, tying the game at 14-14 with a seven-yard touchdown pass to AJ Barner. Seattle's defense and the Kenneth Walker-led rushing attack took over from there as Darnold earned his first win with the team. Darnold posted a 35:12 TD:INT with the Vikings in the 2024 regular season but has a modest 2:2 mark heading into a Week 3 home game against the Saints.
#### Jaxon Smith-Njigba (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Smith-Njigba exceeded 100 receiving yards while pacing the Seahawks in targets, catches and receiving yards for the second time in as many games, quickly establishing himself as the top target for new Seattle quarterback Sam Darnold. JSN's still searching for his first TD of 2025 after scoring six times in his breakout sophomore season last year, but his robust volume gives Smith-Njigba one of the highest fantasy floors among wide receivers heading into a Week 3 home game against the Saints.
