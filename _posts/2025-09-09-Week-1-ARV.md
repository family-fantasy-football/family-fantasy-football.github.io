## Player Report

#### Bijan Robinson (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** As his final line indicates, Robinson was completely stonewalled on the ground by a typically stout Buccaneers run defense. However, the versatile running back made his mark through the air and wasted no time doing so, capping off the game's opening possession with a weaving 50-yard touchdown reception. Robinson would go on to compile exactly that same amount of yardage on his subsequent five receptions, just getting to his second career 100-yard game as a receiver. Better days are naturally ahead for Robinson as a runner as well, and despite the lack of rushing production Sunday, his 18 total touches certainly represent a solid start to his season from a fantasy perspective. Robinson next takes aim at the Vikings defense on the road in a Sunday night Week 2 matchup.
#### Xavier Legette (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The second-year wideout saw a solid share of Bryce Young's attention, but rookie Tetairoa McMillan was the Panthers' clear top option in the passing game, and Legette's longest gain went for just nine yards. After an inconsistent rookie season in 2024, Carolina is hoping Legette can take a step forward as a sophomore, but this wasn't an encouraging performance from the 32nd overall pick in last year's draft. He'll look to deliver a more efficient effort on the road in Week 2 against the Cardinals.
#### Dylan Sampson (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Sampson was expected to serve as the change-of-pace back in Cleveland, but he took the first carry for the Browns and out-touched Jerome Ford 20-7. Sampson wasn't particularly impressive on the ground, but he was still more efficient than Ford. He ultimately made his mark as a pass catcher, however, as he led the Browns in receptions (eight) and was second in yards (64). While it was an encouraging debut for Sampson, the backfield is likely to grow more crowded with the addition of Quinshon Judkins in Week 2 against Baltimore.
#### Jaydon Blue (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** 
#### Bo Nix (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Nix entered 2025 with high expectations after closing the 2024 season with multiple passing touchdowns in seven of his last eight regular-season games. He couldn't carry that momentum into a home matchup against a Titans' defense that is projected to be below-average, as he averaged only 4.4 yards per attempt while throwing a pair of picks on ill-advised throws. Nix did manage a 22-yard touchdown pass to Courtland Sutton just before halftime, but this wasn't the start he hoped for to begin his sophomore campaign.
#### Kalif Raymond (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Raymond was pretty much an afterthought on offense in Week 1, garnering just three looks from quarterback Jared Goff, which ranked sixth on the team. The wide receiver is firmly behind Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jameson Williams on the depth chart, while rookie Isaac TeSlaa figures to see a larger role as the season goes on. Raymond remains more of a special-teams asset than an offensive weapon as the 2025 campaign has gotten underway.
#### Geno Smith (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** The veteran signal-caller looked right at home in a Raiders uniform from the opening possession, which he capped off with perfect 26-yard scoring strike to Tre Tucker. While that would be Smith's only touchdown toss of the game, he would pile up a fantasy-friendly yardage total by connecting with seven different pass catchers, including a trio of rookies in Dont'e Thornton, Jack Bech and Ashton Jeanty. Smith also displayed excellent chemistry with star tight end Brock Bowers, but the latter notably exited the game in the second half with a knee injury. Tom Pelissero of NFL Network reports Bowers downplayed the injury after the contest and stated he wanted to return to the game, so Smith appears to have a good chance of having access to his top target for a Week 2 AFC West home showdown against the Chargers on Monday night, Sept. 15.
#### Kyren Williams (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** It wasn't the most efficient of games from Williams, but he rewarded fantasy managers with the only rushing score of the contest from either side. Another positive takeaway was the backfield touch distribution, with backup RB Blake Corum poaching just two touches from the starter all game. Williams entered this year's drafts as a safe RB1 option, and Sunday's results only confirm that status moving forward. Look for the Notre Dame product to continue dominating the backfield touches in a road matchup against the Titans next Sunday.
#### Puka Nacua (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Nacua took a hit to the helmet at the end of a nine-yard catch on the Rams' second possession that caused a notable cut on his forehead. He was deemed questionable to return as he underwent a concussion check, but before getting back on the field, he was seen with a bandage over the wound, per Greg Beacham of the Associated Press. Nacua will look to build upon the three catches (on four targets) for 23 yards that he put up prior to his earlier exit.
#### Tyreek Hill (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Hill finished as the co-leader in receptions and set the pace in receiving yards, but on a day when Tua Tagovailoa threw for only 114 yards, tossed two interceptions and took three sacks, those team-leading numbers weren't exactly noteworthy. The veteran speedster entered Week 1 with at least some mild questions surrounding his fantasy outlook; however, Hill appeared to maximize his opportunities in a negative game environment Sunday, and he could be in line for a boost in production in a Week 2 home matchup against a Patriots defense that gave up 362 passing yards to the Raiders' Geno Smith in Week 1.
#### Tank Bigsby (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Bigsby took a back seat to Travis Etienne in Week 1, getting outsnapped 40-14 (out of 66 on offense) and outtouched 19-5. All of Bigsby's touches were carries for a measly 12 yards, while Etienne ripped off 156 yards from scrimmage. With this move to Philadelphia, Bigsby may be able to join the RB mix right away after backup Will Shipley suffered a rib injury last Thursday against the Cowboys, but this is still Saquon Barkley's backfield, and veteran AJ Dillon also is on hand. More than likely, Bigsby's immediate impact will occur on kick returns.
#### Cade Otton (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** After managing to head into the weekend without an injury designation following weeks of dealing with leg and groin issues, Otton wasn't able to get on the stat sheet for the first time since Week 2 of last season. Despite the blanking Sunday, Otton will naturally make a much bigger impact on the stat sheet in the majority of games this season, potentially beginning with a Week 2 road showdown against the Texans on Monday night, Sept. 15.
#### Emeka Egbuka (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** The rookie first-round pick had been ascendant since he first stepped on a Buccaneers practice field this offseason, and Egbuka delivered handsomely in his first career regular-season contest. The Ohio State product first struck from 30-yards out just past the midway point of the second quarter, and he subsequently added what would turn out to be a game-winning 25-yard scoring grab with just under a minute remaining. The poise and polish that Egbuka has repeatedly been commended for was on display on his way to a team-leading yardage total, and he'll be in line to play another significant role during a Week 2 marquee interconference road matchup against the Texans on Monday night, Sept. 15.
#### Calvin Ridley (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Ridley led the Titans in targets and receptions, but he was not efficient with his chances and was slightly out of sync with Cameron Ward. The duo connected for a 13-yard gain early in the fourth quarter, Ridley's longest catch of the day. However, he had a few passes glance off his hands later in the contest as the Titans tried to mount a comeback, and Ridley had a particularly costly drop on the team's final offensive possession. While it was a disappointing opening line, Ridley should be in for better performances moving forward thanks to his secure role in the Titans' offense.
#### Deebo Samuel (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Samuel gave the Commanders some breathing room with a 19-yard rushing touchdown in the fourth quarter to extend Washington's lead to 21-6. He also led the team in targets, catches and receiving yards, while no teammate had more than five targets, three catches or 34 receiving yards. Samuel's set to be a key playmaker for the Commanders after coming over from San Francisco in an offseason trade. Up next for Samuel is a Week 2 trip to Green Bay on Thursday.
