## Player Report

#### Bijan Robinson (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** The 181 scrimmage yards were a career high for Robinson, as he hit the century mark in receiving yards for the second time in four games to begin the season. The third-year RB scored on a 14-yard run in the second quarter, his first TD on the ground in 2025, and he's topped 100 combined yards in every game so far. Robinson has amassed 314 rushing yards and 274 receiving yards through four weeks, earning a well-deserved rest during Atlanta's Week 5 bye before facing the Bills in Week 6.
#### Xavier Legette (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Legette has missed back-to-back games and was unable to practice in any capacity en route to being ruled out for Week 4, but it appears he has a better chance to return Week 5 to take on the Dolphins on Sunday, Oct. 5. Across two regular-season appearances so far, the 2024 first-round pick has secured just four of 15 targets for eight yards.
#### Colston Loveland (TE)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** After he managed just one limited practice in Week 4 prep due to a hip injury, Loveland ended up sitting out Sunday's 25-24 win over the Raiders. The rookie first-round pick appears to be trending in the right direction, however, as he took the field for an unofficial practice Tuesday during the team's Week 5 bye. With extra time to heal up, Loveland should be on track to return for the Bears' Week 6 matchup with the Commanders on Oct. 13.
#### Dylan Sampson (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The Browns' backfield is securely in the hands of Quinshon Judkins, who has steadily increased his dominance since being activated in Week 2, while Jerome Ford has a tenuous hold on the No. 2 spot. Sampson has a combined 14 snaps and one target over the last two games.
#### Jaydon Blue (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Blue has been a healthy inactive for each of Dallas' first four games, and as long as both Javonte Williams and Miles Sanders (ankle) are healthy and producing, it's hard to see the rookie making an impact in the box score. Blue is little more than an end-of-bench stash in deeper fantasy leagues and a hold in dynasty formats.
#### Bo Nix (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Nix took full advantage of a cushy matchup and cracked the 300-yard mark in passing for the first time this season. The athletic signal-caller also punched in his first rushing touchdown of the year on a six-yard scamper in the first quarter that wound up being the game-winning score. While this was easily Nix's best performance to date in 2025, fantasy managers may want to keep expectations in check for a road tilt against a far-more talented Philadelphia defense in Week 5.
#### Kalif Raymond (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Raymond was able to match his season highs in catches and targets, but he was still a rather unimpactful part of what the team did on offense. The wide receiver did make his mark on special teams, returning a punt for a score in the fourth quarter, which was his first trip to the end zone in any capacity since Week 8 of the 2024 campaign. Through four games this season, Raymond has reeled in six of nine targets for 47 yards, while also compiling 60 yards on kickoff returns and 114 yards as a punt returner.
#### Geno Smith (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Smith threw an interception in each of the first three quarters before the Bears mounted a comeback in the fourth. The veteran signal-caller was coming off a mistake-free, three-touchdown performance in Week 3, but a pair of three-interception outings have sandwiched that strong showing. Smith will be a risky play against a tough Indianapolis defense next Sunday.
#### Puka Nacua (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Nacua finally cashed in his first receiving touchdown of 2025, which had been the only ingredient missing from a white-hot start to the campaign. The star wideout garnered a whopping 15 targets for the second consecutive game, confirming his status as QB Matthew Stafford's unquestioned No. 1 option even with the addition of Davante Adams this past offseason. The 24-year-old Nacua is also proving to be one of the top players in general in fantasy with 555 combined yards from scrimmage and two total touchdowns through four games, as he scored a 45-yard rushing TD in Week 2. The Rams will face a quick turnaround before hosting the 49ers in a battle of 3-1 NFC West clubs on Thursday Night Football in Week 5.
#### Kyren Williams (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Williams' fumble early in the fourth quarter didn't end up costing his team a shot at victory, but it put a stink on a fantasy score that didn't feature a trip to the end zone. The fourth-year back still finished as the Rams' leading rusher as per usual while out-touching backup Blake Corum 16 to 11 with far better efficiency. Williams has helped offset Corum's increased usage by averaging a healthy 4.5 yards per tote. The 24-year-old Williams will continue spearheading Los Angeles' rushing attack when the Rams host the 49ers on Thursday Night Football in Week 5.
#### Tyreek Hill (WR)
**Injury Status:** Injured Reserve <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Per Marcel Louis-Jacques of ESPN,   Hill -- who underwent a major procedure Tuesday to repair his dislocated left knee and multiple torn ligaments, including his ACL -- won't need additional surgery, with agent Drew Rosenhaus indicating afterward that the wideout will play next season, while noting that "the realistic goal is the start of the season." In Hill's absence for the rest of the 2025 campaign, Malik Washington and Nick Westbrook-Ikhine are in line to see expanded roles alongside top WR Jaylen Waddle, with Dee Eskridge, Cedrick Wilson and Tahj Washington available to mix in.
#### Tank Bigsby (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The Eagles acquired Bigsby from the Jaguars after Week 1 but have yet to make him part of the offensive gameplan. He's been used as a kick returner but hasn't seen the field on offense in any of his three games with his new team. With Will Shipley back from an oblique injury, Bigsby is now the fourth running back on the depth chart.
#### Cade Otton (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** The fourth-year tight end didn't crack the stat sheet Week 3 despite playing 66 snaps, but he was back on the radar Sunday, albeit in very modest fashion. Otton once again spent the majority of the game on the field -- he played 69 snaps (96 percent). However, he's clearly taken a step back in the pecking order in new coordinator Josh Grizzard's scheme, considering he's mustered just a 6-34-0 line through four games despite playing every contest thus far without one of Mike Evans (hamstring) or Chris Godwin available.
#### Emeka Egbuka (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** The rookie tied for the team lead in targets with Chris Godwin (ankle) in the veteran's season debut, and Egbuka flashed with a 77-yard touchdown grab early in the third quarter. The 2025 first-round pick's yardage total was also a career-high figure, and his TD was already his fourth in four NFL games. Egbuka's target total has risen in each contest, and that trend could continue in a Week 5 road matchup against the Seahawks with Mike Evans (hamstring) expected to remain on the shelf.
#### Calvin Ridley (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** After playing at least 86 percent of the offensive snaps during each of the Titans' first three games, Ridley was on the field for just 54 percent against Houston. It translated into yet another disappointing box score for the 30-year-old wideout, as he finished with just two catches for 30 scoreless yards on three targets. Ridley has yet to find the end zone this season and has been held to 30 yards or fewer in three of four contests. In total, Ridley has an ugly 10-141-0 line on 24 targets. Among wide receivers with at least 10 targets this season, Ridley's 41.7 percent catch rate is fifth worst at the position. It's unclear if the undisclosed injury will hamper Ridley at all next Sunday against the Cardinals.
#### Deebo Samuel (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** With Terry McLaurin (quadriceps) inactive, Samuel was the top option for Marcus Mariota and hauled in a 24-yard TD in the fourth quarter as the Commanders tried to mount a late rally. McLaurin seems unlikely to make a quick return, but the Washington passing game could get a significant boost in Week 5 if Jayden Daniels (knee) is cleared to play. Samuel will take a 22-204-2 line on 27 targets into next week's clash with the Chargers.
