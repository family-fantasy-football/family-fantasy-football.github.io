## Player Report

#### Bijan Robinson (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Fresh off of recording a new career high in total yardage (181) in the Falcons' last win, Robinson wasted no time setting a new high-water mark with 238 yards from scrimmage against the Bills. The majority of the fantasy star's production came on the ground this time around, with Monday's 170 rushing yards representing another career best. Robinson is providing a whopping 164.4 combined yards per game for his managers this season. To put that into perspective, the Texas product averaged 111.0 total yards per game over the course of his breakout fantasy campaign in 2024. Robinson's domination of opposing defenses should continue Week 7 against a 49ers defense that will be without star players Fred Warner (ankle) and Nick Bosa (knee).
#### Xavier Legette (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Since returning from injury in Carolina's Week 5 win over the Dolphins, Legette has been targeted just five times, catching four passes for 42 yards and a touchdown over the team's last two games. He was outpaced by rookie wideouts Tetairoa McMillan (3-39-2) and Jimmy Horn (2-36-0), finishing sixth on the team in receiving yards during Sunday's victory. Although the second-year pro continues to operate as the Panthers' No. 2 wide receiver, his involvement has been limited, with most of the team's offensive production coming from McMillan and Rico Dowdle. Legette draws another great matchup in Week 7 against a struggling Jets defense, but he's still unlikely to make a meaningful fantasy impact.
#### Colston Loveland (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Loveland has five receptions this season, and limited usage keeps him a watch-list tight end until his usage increases.
#### Dylan Sampson (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Sampson had his highest usage since Week 1, including a turn as the primary kickoff returner. Once Quinshon Judkins was established as the lead back, Sampson's role evaporated. He had just four touches over the last three weeks, while getting single-digit snaps in all three contests.
#### Jaydon Blue (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The rookie running back saw only five snaps (nine percent) on offense as Javonte Williams continues to dominate the workload in the Dallas backfield. Blue did gain 40 yards on two kickoff returns, but even that role will disappear once KaVontae Turpin (foot) gets healthy. Blue's only fantasy value right is as insurance against a Williams injury.
#### Bo Nix (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Nix played the role of game manager for Denver in a gritty defensive victory overseas in London. The 25-year-old did not complete a pass for the entirety of the third quarter, which helped contribute to his second-lowest yardage output as a passer this season. On the bright side, Nix was involved in the only touchdown scored for either side Sunday, delivering a 16-yard strike to TE Nate Adkins in the first quarter. With nine touchdowns thrown to four interceptions through six starts, Nix checks in as a middling fantasy option in Week 7 when the Broncos host the Giants next Sunday.
#### Kalif Raymond (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Raymond was cleared to play after suffering a neck injury in Week 5, but he only logged two snaps on offense and one snap with the special-teams unit. The wide receiver will look to be more involved Week 7 versus the Buccaneers after having an additional week to return to form following his injury.
#### Geno Smith (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Smith got the Raiders back in the win column after a recent poor string of play had critics calling for a quarterback change in Las Vegas. The veteran signal-caller appears to have staved off a potential QB controversy with improved play against a struggling Titans squad Sunday. The 34-year-old still couldn't pitch a clean outing, throwing his 10th interception of campaign early in the fourth quarter. The late turnover didn't cost his team a chance at victory, meaning Smith should remain under center for a tough road matchup against the Chiefs next Sunday.
#### Puka Nacua (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** The star wideout suffered a left ankle sprain during Sunday's 17-3 win at Baltimore, but Nacua being described in such a manner by McVay is a touch more optimistic than a report from Ian Rapoport of NFL Network that suggested he's set to miss time. Nacua's status appears uncertain at best for Los Angeles' matchup against the Jaguars in London in Week 7, and a Week 8 bye could nudge the team in the direction of caution. McVay hasn't ruled Nacua out yet for this coming Sunday's game, Dragon confirms, so final clarity on his status likely won't arrive until the Rams have had a chance to evaluate him at practice. Stu Jackson of the team's official site reports that scans have indicated Nacua isn't dealing with a long-term injury.
#### Kyren Williams (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** The Rams possessed the ball for only 22:05 of game time while averaging only 4.7 yards per play. That led to modest stat lines for the entire skills corps, though Williams was on the better end of things thanks to a three-yard touchdown run early in the third quarter. One play earlier, he made a falling 30-yard reception on fourth down that kept the drive alive. Overall, Williams delivered a well-rounded stat line and also kept the ball secure after losing a fumble in each of his last two games.
#### Kendre Miller (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** After back-to-back games with double-digit carries, Miller was stonewalled for his second-least efficient rushing performance of the season. The third-year running back has now averaged 7.6 carries per game this season. Over the last three games, he's averaging 9.6 rushing attempts for 42.3 yards per contest while operating as the No. 2 running back behind Alvin Kamara. Miller will look to remain involved in his backup role during the Week 7 matchup versus the Bears on Sunday, Sept. 19.
#### Tank Bigsby (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Bigsby hasn't played a single offensive snap since being acquired by the Eagles after Week 1. He's the fourth running back on the Eagles' depth chart, so even an injury to Saquon Barkley likely wouldn't be enough for him to move into a meaningful role.
#### Emeka Egbuka (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Egbuka secured two of four targets for 24 yards before being forced out Sunday, a contest in which the Buccaneers were missing Mike Evans (hamstring) and Chris Godwin (fibula), as well as top running back Bucky Irving (shoulder). It would be a significant blow for the offense if Egbuka is unable to return for a road Monday Night Football matchup against the Lions in Week 7, as the rookie phenom has racked up a 25-445-5 line on 38 targets. With Egbuka, Evans and Godwin all uncertain to play, Sterling Shepard, Tez Johnson, Kameron Johnson and tight end Cade Otton could be positioned as Baker Mayfield's top receiving options versus Detroit.
#### Cade Otton (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Otton paced the Buccaneers in targets and receptions while finishing with his second-highest yardage total of the season. Part of the reason the tight end was featured so prominently Sunday was the early departure of star rookie Emeka Egbuka. Otton remained scoreless through six starts, but he is getting involved downfield more often as Tampa Bay deals with injuries at the wideout position. Otton will look to build a hot streak with another strong showing against the Lions next Monday.
#### Calvin Ridley (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Ridley thus ends his day with one catch (on one target) for 18 yards, while Elic Ayomanor, Chimere Dike, Tyler Lockett and Van Jefferson will handle the Titans' WR duties in his absence for the remainder of the contest. Ridley's next chance to see game action will arrive Oct. 19 against the Patriots.
#### Deebo Samuel (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Samuel wasn't at 100 percent, and although Jayden Daniels kept him involved, the veteran receiver couldn't do much with his opportunities. Samuel posted his second-lowest receiving yardage total of the season, but his injury seemed to play a role. The seven-year pro will look to get healthier ahead of a key Week 7 road matchup against the Cowboys on Sunday.
