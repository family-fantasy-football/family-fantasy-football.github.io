## Player Report

#### Bijan Robinson (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Robinson got off to a quick start to the game, with his first two carries combining to go for 42 yards. He chipped in additional long gains of 18 and 11 yards in the third quarter to ultimately average 6.5 yards per attempt. The only thing missing from Robinson's performance was a trip to the end zone, as Tyler Allgeier instead got that opportunity late in the third quarter. Robinson topped 100 yards from scrimmage for the second consecutive game and rebounded on the ground after gaining only 24 yards as a rusher in Week 1.
#### Xavier Legette (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The second-year wideout has managed just four receptions for eight yards through two games this season, a concerning start considering the Panthers attempted 90 passes over that span. However, there's still reason for optimism regarding Legette's season-long fantasy output, as his 15 targets tie Hunter Renfrow for the second-most on the team. Legette will look to turn that volume into production in a divisional matchup against the Falcons in Week 3.
#### Colston Loveland (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Afte catching both of his targets against Minnesota in the season opener, Loveland was shut out on one target against the Lions. The rookie has seen half of the targets that fellow tight end Cole Kmet has. Loveland may work his way into an expanded role, but he's currently a risky fantasy option.
#### Dylan Sampson (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Sampson had led the Browns' ground attack with 12 carries and had garnered 20 total touches in Week 1, but the debut of fellow rookie Quinshon Judkins in Sunday's loss altered the backfield hierarchy. Judkins ultimately recorded a game-high 10 rush attempts, but Sampson still found a way to make an impact by recording an eight-yard touchdown reception from another member of the team's 2025 draft class, Dillon Gabriel. With Judkins' workload a virtual lock to go up from this point forward, Sampson will likely be looking to displace veteran Jerome Ford for the No. 2 role.
#### Jaydon Blue (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The rookie fifth-round draft pick will have to wait at least one more week to make his NFL debut, as Dallas will proceed with Javonte Williams and Miles Sanders as its lone active running backs for the second straight game. Though Williams looks to be locked in as Dallas' lead back after producing two touchdowns and 64 total yards on 17 touches in the Week 1 loss to the Eagles, Blue could eventually unseat Sanders -- who committed a costly fumble in the opener -- for the No. 2 role as the season unfolds.
#### Bo Nix (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Nix and the Broncos' offense began the game in exceptional form, as he threw for three touchdowns on the team's first four offensive possessions. His most impressive was a 23-yard dart to the back corner of the end zone to Marvin Mims, and Nix also connected with Troy Franklin for a 42-yard gain early in the second quarter. Things changed in the second half, however, as his explosive plays were eliminated, and he also threw a key interception early in the fourth quarter to aid the Colts' comeback efforts. Nix's fantasy performance was solid, but he now has three interceptions and a fumble lost in the first two games of the new campaign.
#### Kalif Raymond (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Raymond once again was quiet Week 2, playing just 32 offensive snaps in Detroit's dominant victory. The wide receiver snagged his only catch of the day on the team's third possession of the contest, but he did garner 15 more offensive snaps than rookie Isaac TeSlaa, so Raymond does still appear to be the No. 3 option at his position behind Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jameson Williams. With many mouths to feed on offense in Detroit, Raymond doesn't offer much weekly upside for fantasy managers, and his greatest impact for the team comes as a punt returner.
#### Geno Smith (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** This outing was doomed from the get go when Smith threw the first of three interceptions on the first play from scrimmage. The 34-year-old had no answers after netting just 45 yards of offense through the first half of action Monday. This putrid showing comes on the heels of Smith airing it out for 362 yards in a Week 1 win over the Patriots, highlighting the peaks and valleys that come with a quarterback who threw 21 TDs to 15 INTs with Seattle last season. The Raiders will be counting on a bounce-back performance from its veteran signal-caller in a softer matchup against Washington in Week 3.
#### Kyren Williams (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Williams dominated touches out of the Rams' backfield for the most of the game, but he was inefficient once again. He delivered 12- and 15-yard rushes late in the fourth quarter to salvage his day, but that came one drive after he ceded a possession to Blake Corum that concluded with Corum in the end zone. Corum's opportunity was likely due to the Rams being up two scores midway through the fourth quarter, but Williams' usage in the red zone will remain worth monitoring.
#### Puka Nacua (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Nacua made an impact in both conventional and unconventional fashion in Sunday's win. He kicked things off with a 45-yard rushing score early in the first quarter on an end around. Nacua then went on to add long receptions of 24 and 22 yards to cap off an excellent all-around fantasy performance. Through two games, he has 266 yards from scrimmage and 18 receptions.
#### Tyreek Hill (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Hill set the pace for the Dolphins in receiving yards while checking in second in receptions and targets. Hill's day could have been even bigger had Tua Tagovailoa not missed him when he was wide open on a second-half pass, but the fact the talented wideout put together his first 100-yard effort of the campaign was certainly a bright spot during a loss that dropped the Dolphins to 0-2. With Miami desperate for a win, Hill figures to be prominently featured again in a Thursday night Week 3 road matchup against the Bills that is arguably already a critical game for the Dolphins.
#### Tank Bigsby (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Acquired from the Jaguars for a fifth- and sixth-round draft pick at the start of the week, Bigsby was not yet part of the Eagles' offensive gameplan. His only snaps came on special teams. He'll compete with Will Shipley (ribs) and AJ Dillon for the backup role behind Saquon Barkley once he's more integrated with his new team.
#### Emeka Egbuka (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** The rookie first-round pick had a relatively quiet latter portion of the game, but not before making his mark with what was already his third trip to the end zone through two NFL games. Egbuka scored on a nifty 15-yard catch and run in the second quarter, a play that accounted for more than half of his receiving yardage on the night. The Texans, like the Falcons in Week 1, generally did a good job keeping plays in front of them, but Egbuka could benefit from the heavy attention Sauce Gardner is likely to bestow on Mike Evans in a Week 3 home matchup against the Jets on Sunday afternoon.
#### Calvin Ridley (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Ridley tied for the team lead in targets with both Elic Ayomanor and Chig Okonkwo, though he beat out Ayomanor by one yard to lead Tennessee pass catchers. Ridley's longest catch of the day went for 26 yards, when Cam Ward rolled out to his right and hit him along the sideline. It was an improved performance for Ridley, though Ayomanor is emerging as a key part of the offense and looks likely to continue to cut into Ridley's opportunities.
#### Deebo Samuel (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The Commanders' air attack was mostly stuck in neutral for a significant portion of the night, but Samuel was able to offer some solace to fantasy managers by recording 12- and 10-yard grabs on Washington's final scoring drive. The latter play also resulted in Samuel's second touchdown in as many games in a Commanders uniform, and he's now encouragingly logged 18 targets through his first two games with Jayden Daniels. Samuel next takes aim at the Raiders defense in a Week 3 home matchup on Sunday, Sept. 21.
