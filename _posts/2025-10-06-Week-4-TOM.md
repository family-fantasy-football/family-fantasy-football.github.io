## Player Report

#### Marvin Harrison Jr. (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Harrison got off to a remarkable start to the game, leaping over a pair of defenders for what initially appeared to be a 44-yard touchdown on Arizona's opening drive. He was ruled down at the one after review, though it was still his second catch of at least 40 yards this season. Harrison then recorded gains of 20 and 16 yards on Arizona's next drive, before largely disappearing from the game plan as the Cardinals got very conservative on offense. While the performance was nearly much bigger from a fantasy perspective, Harrison is starting to stack together positive showings after delivering 66 yards and a touchdown in Week 4.
#### James Cook (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Cook endured his worst game of the season both as a rusher and receiver. His longest rush of the day went for only nine yards, and he also went without a catch for the first time on the campaign. Positively, Cook still dominated opportunity out of Bills' backfield, with Ray Davis and Ty Johnson combining to see only four rushing attempts with zero targets. Cook should have a strong chance of bouncing back in Week 6 against Atlanta.
#### J.K. Dobbins (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Dobbins remained the clear lead back, with rookie RJ Harvey logging only four carries. The former toughed out a difficult matchup on the ground, with his long run on the afternoon a modest 17 yards. Dobbins recorded his fourth rushing touchdown in five games on a two-yard run early in the fourth quarter, while his yardage total was his third highest of the campaign and fourth over 75 yards already in 2025. Dobbins has played a minimal role in the passing game so far, but his secure role in the ground attack gives him an appealing fantasy floor heading into a favorable Week 6 matchup in London against the Jets next Sunday.
#### Jared Goff (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Goff took advantage of a favorable matchup to turn in an extremely efficient performance. He completed four passes of 20 or more yards and averaged over 10 yards per attempt for the second time this season. Goff also delivered touchdowns from 10, 20 and 12 yards to account for his second performance with at least three scores. He'll face a stiffer Week 6 challenge against the Chiefs.
#### Matthew Golden (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Golden took on a bigger role with Jayden Reed (collarbone) on IR, as the rookie logged his highest target, reception and yardage totals of his career. Most of his production came on the team's opening possession, as he got behind the Cowboys' secondary for a 46-yard catch -- the longest of his career. Golden appears to be on the verge of truly breaking out as his role continues to expand, but he'll continue to face plenty of target competition from the likes of tight end Tucker Kraft and fellow wideouts Romeo Doubs and Dontayvion Wicks.
#### Romeo Doubs (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Doubs led the Packers in targets in the absence of Jayden Reed (collarbone) and was a key to the team's offensive explosion with touchdown catches of one, two and 15 yards. Doubs was targeted primarily in the short areas of the field and his longest reception went for only 18 yards. He still managed to top 50 receiving yards for the second time this season, but even with Reed and Christian Watson (knee) on the shelf, target competition remains fierce in Green Bay and coach Matt LaFleur's offensive scheme won't move away from Josh Jacobs and the ground game.
#### Tyler Warren (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** The versatile rookie tight end crossed the goal line for the second consecutive game and first time as a receiver, bringing in an 11-yard scoring grab early in the second quarter. Warren has at least four catches in four of his first five games and at least 70 receiving yards on three occasions already. Warren will draw another favorable matchup when the Cardinals come to town for a Week 6 interconference clash next Sunday afternoon.
#### Travis Hunter (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Hunter was involved more on offense (38 snaps) than defense (nine snaps) Sunday, resulting in his highest yardage total through four pro appearances. The two-way star finished third for Jacksonville in both targets and receiving production. The Jaguars will continue searching for that sweet spot in terms of Hunter's usage on both sides of the ball when the team visits Kansas City next Monday.
#### Ashton Jeanty (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Jeanty ultimately saw his rushing workload somewhat curtailed due to the game getting completely away from the Raiders, but the talented back was impressive again with the opportunities he did see. Those touches helped net new single-game career highs in receptions, receiving yards and targets for the rookie first-round pick, who corroborated the value of keeping him involved in the game even when Las Vegas is on the wrong end of a lopsided score. Jeanty will remain a highly appealing option in all formats in an enticing Week 6 home matchup against the Titans next Sunday afternoon.
#### Omarion Hampton (RB)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Hampton's status is thus worth monitoring carefully ahead of the Chargers' Oct. 12 game against the Dolphins, but if he's forced to miss time, Hassan Haskins and Kimani Vidal (who has been elevated from the practice squad the last two weeks) would be next in line for Los Angeles' backfield touches.
#### Ollie Gordon II (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Gordon found much less running room than backfield mate De'Von Achane, who picked up 99 yards and scored a touchdown on his 20 totes. Gordon now has single-digit rushing yardage totals in three of his first four games, and although he's earned some short-yardage and red-zone work, he saw Achane cash in on an opportunity in the latter capacity with a nine-yard touchdown run in the third quarter. The rookie sixth-round pick's fantasy prospects remain modest heading into a Week 5 road matchup against the Panthers that is favorable for ground attacks.
#### Jaxson Dart (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** The rookie's second career NFL start didn't go as well as his first, as Dart put the ball on the ground in the third quarter with his team down only 16-14, and then threw two picks in the fourth quarter while trying to mount a comeback. Dart leaned heavily on short routes in his first game working without Malik Nabers (knee), with tight end Theo Johnson catching both his TDs and Johnson, No. 2 tight end Daniel Bellinger and running back Cam Skattebo combining for 16 receptions. Dart will need to clean up his turnovers in Week 6 if the Giants are going to have any hope of upsetting the NFC East-leading Eagles.
#### Jonnu Smith (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Smith was unable to practice fully ahead of Pittsburgh's Week 4 matchup due to a hip injury, but he played through the issue in Dublin. The 2017 third-rounder was held to single-digit yards for the first time this season while playing just 25 percent of the team's offensive snaps, which was his lowest mark of the season by a considerable margin. It seems possible that Smith's role was limited by his injury, but he'll be able to recover during the Steelers' Week 5 bye.
#### Mac Jones (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Prior to Thursday's game, Brock Purdy was announced as week-to-week for the foreseeable future due to his troublesome toe, but on a couple of occasions in the marathon win, it appeared the 49ers could lose Jones as well. Already managing a PCL injury coming in, Jones took two particularly hard shots on sacks in the second half and overtime, including one late in the third quarter where he remained on the ground for some time clutching his leg in pain. Nevertheless, Jones didn't miss any plays and put together another highly impressive performance, one that featured his highest passing yardage total of the season and pushed him to a 6:1 TD:INT on the campaign. Jones hit Jake Tonges (six yards) and Christian McCaffrey (one yard) for his two first-half scoring tosses, and he also spearheaded an eight-play drive in overtime to set up Eddy Pineiro's tie-breaking (and eventual game-winning) field goal. The veteran signal-caller now will have a few extra days to heal up for a Week 6 road matchup against the Buccaneers on Sunday, Oct. 12.
#### Chig Okonkwo (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Cam Ward's struggles continued, as he completed only 38.5 percent of his passes while passing for 108 yards. No skill-position player on Tennessee's roster was able to excel as a result, and Okonkwo was no exception. The tight end leads the team in catches with 13 and is third in targets with 19, but that volume has resulted in only 124 receiving yards and zero TDs through four games.
