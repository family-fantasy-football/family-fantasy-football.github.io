## Player Report

#### Marvin Harrison Jr. (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Harrison's production crashed in Week 2 following last week's team-high receiving line of 5-71-1 against the Saints. The 23-year-old took a back seat to TE Trey McBride (6-78-0) while fellow wideout Michael Wilson caught QB Kyler Murray's lone touchdown pass Sunday. Harrison experienced his fair share of ups-and-downs over his rookie campaign in 2024, and we may not see much consistency from him as a sophomore based on this two-game sample size. Fantasy managers will be hoping for one of Harrison's "up" games in road tilt against San Francisco next Sunday.
#### James Cook (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Cook once again operated as the clear lead back, as Ray Davis and Ty Johnson combined for just 30 scrimmage yards, with most of the backups' opportunities coming after the game was well in hand. Buffalo capitalized on a drive-extending roughing the passer penalty to open the scoring with a one-yard Cook rushing touchdown, and he added a 44-yard touchdown run in the second quarter to extend the lead to 20-0. Cook's versatile skill set allows him to stay heavily involved regardless of game script, and he has three total touchdowns heading into Thursday's Week 3 home game against the 0-2 Dolphins after racking up 18 scrimmage TDs in the 2024 regular season.
#### Joe Burrow (QB)
**Injury Status:** Out <br>
**Lineup Slot:** IR <br>
**Details:** Burrow reportedly suffered a turf toe injury during Sunday's win over the Jaguars and is facing a minimum recovery timetable of three months if he undergoes surgery, per Adam Schefter of ESPN, which could allow him to return in mid-December. The team hasn't yet confirmed either the severity of Burrow's injury or the possibility of him potentially returning this season, according to Charlie Goldsmith of the Dayton Daily News. Jake Browning will take over under center as long as Burrow is sidelined, priming him to start on the road against Minnesota on Sunday, and the Bengals seem like strong candidates to pursue additional depth at the quarterback position.
#### J.K. Dobbins (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Dobbins continued to work clearly as the top back in Denver, tallying 15 touches compared to six for RJ Harvey. Dobbins was also the more effective back, highlighted by long runs of 23 and 18 yards. The primary negative to his performance came near the goal line, as he was stuffed from the one-yard line on two separate drives before finally scoring from five yards away early in the third quarter. While those were lost opportunities for Dobbins, he has found the end zone in each of Denver's first two games while combining to rush for 138 yards.
#### Jared Goff (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Goff can usually be counted on for at least one major spike performance each campaign, and such an instance came early this season. The veteran signal-caller was nearly perfect while finishing with 156.0 QB rating, and he spread the ball around to eight different targets overall. Goff's scoring strikes went to Brock Wright (eight yards), Amon-Ra St. Brown (four, eight and four yards) and Jameson Williams (44 yards), helping the Lions' offense atone in spectacular fashion for its sleepy Week 1 performance against the Packers. Putting together a comparable encore could prove challenging, however, as the Lions travel to Baltimore to face the Ravens in a Week 3 showdown on Monday night, Sept. 22.
#### Matthew Golden (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The rookie first-round pick just missed bringing in a touchdown on one of his two targets, but the play was broken up by an outstanding effort from cornerback Trey Amos. Golden hasn't managed to carve out a substantial role yet in a deep Packers receiving corps, though he could get more opportunities as soon as Week 3 against the Browns in the absence of Jayden Reed, who broke his collarbone in Thursday's win. Golden's 59 percent snap share Thursday was second behind Romeo Doubs' 74 percent among Green Bay's wide receivers and represented a slight uptick from his 48 percent mark from Week 1.
#### Romeo Doubs (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Doubs was third in both targets and receptions on the night for the Packers, tying with running back Chris Brooks in the latter category. The veteran wideout saw Jayden Reed exit the game in the first quarter due to what was labeled as a shoulder injury at the time, but Doubs saw only one more target than he had Sunday against the Lions. Nevertheless, Doubs managed to record a five-yard touchdown grab in the opening period to give his fantasy production a much-needed boost, and he'll be due for an expanded role beginning with a Week 3 road matchup against the Browns on Sunday, Sept. 21 due to Reed having been diagnosed with a broken collarbone, per Zach Jacobson of 247Sports.com.
#### Jayden Higgins (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Higgins' lone catch put the Texans in business deep in Buccaneers' territory, but the offense failed to capitalize. The rookie wideout has three receptions (four targets) for 60 yards, including two 20+ receptions. Higgins is part of a crew that includes Xavier Hutchinson, Jaylin Noel and Justin Watson that are receiving more playing time with Christian Kirk (hamstring) unavailable. One or more of that group will experience a drop in snap count once Kirk is ready.
#### Tyler Warren (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Warren finished second on the team in targets behind Josh Downs, but he flashed strong playmaking ability to lead the team in yards. Warren began his performance with a 41-yard reception on the Colts' second possession and followed that up with additional explosive gains of 14 and 15 yards. He has immediately taken over as the team's top pass catcher, recording a combined 11 receptions for 155 yards in his first two games as a pro.
#### Travis Hunter (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Hunter put together another modest showing on offense to open his NFL career, although he was encouragingly third in targets and also saw an increase in his involvement on defense. One of those looks resulted in a first-quarter interception by the Bengals' Dax Hill, and Hunter was ultimately outproduced by Nos. 3 and No. 4 receivers Dyami Brown and Parker Washington in addition to top wideout Brian Thomas. Nevertheless, Hunter's talent likely isn't going to allow him to be held down for long, and the rookie second-overall pick's next opportunity to enjoy his first breakout game as a professional comes in a Week 3 home matchup against the Texans next Sunday afternoon.
#### Ashton Jeanty (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** The Raiders continued deploying Jeanty as the team's bellcow out of the backfield, handing the rookie 11 of the 13 carries dispersed to running backs Monday. The sixth-overall pick from this year's draft failed to repeat last week's trip to the end zone, resulting in a middling fantasy score in his second pro appearance. Jeanty's monster share of backfield touches combined with the upside that made him such a high draft choice keep his fantasy ceiling raised as the season rolls along. The Boise State product's next opportunity to break out will come in a road matchup against the Commanders on Sunday.
#### Omarion Hampton (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** There wasn't a whole lot of positive takeaways for the rookie in this one. One week after leading the backfield in touches, Hampton split the carries evenly with Najee Harris at eight each and the veteran also chipped in with two receptions for 20 yards. Perhaps more crucially, a botched handoff on the Chargers' penultimate possession directly led to a fumble which gave the Raiders a modicum of life, and then Harris finished the ensuing series to ice the game. Hampton could turn things around Week 3 against a Broncos defense that just allowed 215 total yards to Jonathan Taylor.
#### Ollie Gordon II (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Gordon was again relegated to a minor role behind starting RB De'Von Achane, even with Jaylen Wright (knee) sidelined a second straight week. With Wright seemingly a candidate to suit up Thursday night against the Bills in Week 3, Gordon's path to consistent offensive touches is only going to get cloudier. The rookie sixth-round pick's involvement could ramp up as the season progresses, especially if Miami's season goes completely off the rails, but for now Gordon isn't a consideration for weekly fantasy lineups.
#### Jonnu Smith (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Smith saw his role as a pass catcher even out with Pat Freiermuth, as both tight ends earned four targets. As was the case in Week 1, Smith was used on short and quick passes with the goal of picking up yards after the catch. Smith's longest gain of the day went for only nine yards, and he has just 42 total yards on nine catches for the campaign.
#### Chig Okonkwo (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Okonkwo tied for the team lead with six targets, though he couldn't match Elic Ayomanor or Calvin Ridley in their ability to generate yards. Okonkwo was targeted in short areas of the field, though he did manage a long gain of 14 yards. He may start to lose playing time to Gunnar Helm as the season progresses, but Okonkwo has commanded a solid 10 targets across the first two games of the campaign.
