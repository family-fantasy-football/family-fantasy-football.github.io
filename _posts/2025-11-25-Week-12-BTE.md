## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 DJ Moore (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> In what has been a rare instance this season, Moore outperformed fellow wideout Rome Odunze on the afternoon, leading the Bears in receptions and receiving yards while checking in second to his teammate in targets. Moore also was the only one of the two to get into the end zone, recording touchdowns of five and 25 yards in the first and third quarter, respectively. The veteran wideout hadn't scored since Week 3 prior to Sunday, and his performance snapped an ugly two-game funk during which he'd recorded just one catch for 18 yards on seven targets. Moore and the Bears' air attack draw a tough Week 13 matchup on Black Friday, when they'll travel to face the defending champion Eagles.
</div>

### 🟡 Joe Flacco (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Bengals didn't actually practice Monday but were required to post an injury report ahead of Thursday night's game against the Ravens. Flacco has been dealing with the shoulder issue for weeks and now has a finger injury. The big news for Cincinnati is Joe Burrow's (toe) estimation as a full participant, and he's expected to be under center on Thanksgiving night.
</div>

### 🟢 Tee Higgins (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Out<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Higgins sustained a concussion late in Sunday's loss to the Patriots after smacking the back of his head on the turf while attempting to make a leaping catch. With Higgins out and Ja'Marr Chase set to return from his one-game suspension, the Bengals likely will trot out a wideout group of Chase, Andrei Iosivas, Mitchell Tinsley and Charlie Jones versus Baltimore. Higgins then will have 10 more days to heal up ahead of a Week 14 date with the Bills on Sunday, Dec. 7.
</div>

### 🟡 C.J. Stroud (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Texans had a strong first half against the Bills, rolling up 20 points, but the offense was limited to just 60 net yards after the break. Four of the team's five possessions ended in a punt, including three three-and-outs. The one scoring drive was a squandered opportunity that began at Buffalo's 22-yard line and ended with a field goal. A healthy Stroud could be the elixir to solve the execution woes. His accuracy and arm talent are considered better than those of Davis Mills, which means defenses would be forced to respect the passing game. Stroud opened the week still in the concussion protocol, but there's optimism after he practiced last week and will have multiple practices available for him to clear this week.
</div>

### 🟢 Juwan Johnson (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Johnson tied his second-most receptions in a game this season. After catching touchdowns in each of his previous two outings, the tight end finished as the Saints' second-leading receiver behind WR1 Chris Olave. Johnson also tied with running back Devin Neal and wideout Devaughn Vele for the team's second-most targets. Johnson is still on pace to have a career-best season, averaging 4.5 catches (on 6.2 targets) for 48.8 yards across 11 outings. He should continue to serve as New Orleans' No. 2 target during a Week 13 game versus Miami on Sunday, Nov. 30.
</div>

### 🟢 Tyler Shough (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Shough's first career home start was bookmarked by a pair of turnovers, as he lost a fumble on a botched exchange on the Saints' second offensive play before throwing an interception on a heave in the final seconds. The rookie quarterback was under fire during his first career home start, getting sacked five times. He also finished as New Orleans' leading rusher after RB1 Alvin Kamara was forced out with a knee injury in the first half. The lackluster support system around Shough isn't likely to make things easier for him moving forward. He and the rest of the offense will look to clean things up ahead of a Week 13 contest versus Miami on Sunday, Nov. 30.
</div>

### 🟢 Devin Singletary (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Singletary had 14 touches to Tyrone Tracy's 23. Tracy churned out 130 scrimmage yards and has pulled away from Singletary as the busier and more effective part of the Giants' running back platoon. It won't show up on the stat sheet, but Singletary also touched the ball on Wan'Dale Robinson's 39-yard touchdown catch on the opening drive, tossing the ball back to Jameis Winston on a flea flicker. Whether the Giants get Jaxson Dart (concussion) back or give Winston a third straight start under center in Week 13 against the Patriots, Singletary's likely to continue working as a complementary option alongside Tracy.
</div>

### 🟢 Breece Hall (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Hall has recorded at least 111 scrimmage yards in six of 11 games this season and at least 119 yards in three of the past four games. His fumble came at the two-yard line in the fourth quarter as he was battling for extra yards at the end of an 11-yard run. Hall led the Jets in both rushing yards and receiving yards for the second time in the past three games, so he's poised to maintain a significant role in the Jets' underwhelming offense against the Falcons in Week 13.
</div>

### 🟢 Dallas Goedert (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Goedert took on a secondary role in the Philadelphia offense behind both DeVonta Smith and A.J. Brown, matching his season low in targets. He had a pair of catches wiped out by penalties, but Goedert still has 30 or fewer yards in five of his last seven games. Given the inconsistency of the Eagles' passing offense as a whole, Goedert is difficult to trust as a fantasy starter, barring either Smith or Brown being absent.
</div>

### 🟢 Roman Wilson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Wilson had recorded at least one catch in each of his last six games, but he failed to establish a connection with quarterback Mason Rudolph in Chicago on Sunday. Wilson was also on the field for just 28 percent of the Steelers' offensive snaps, which was his lowest mark since Week 6. He's shown some glimpses of production this season but hasn't been a very reliable fantasy option.
</div>

### 🟢 Calvin Austin III (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> After a quiet showing in Week 11, Austin rebounded to his more typical role. He has between five and seven targets in four of his last five games, though he's struggled to make an impact with that opportunity. Austin has been held to 40 receiving yards or less in all but two of his 10 contests and hasn't found the end zone since Week 3.
</div>

### 🟢 Jauan Jennings (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jennings kicked things off with a 12-yard touchdown grab on the opening possession of Monday Night Football. It was the 27-year-old's fourth trip to the end zone this season, with three of those coming over San Francisco's last four contests. Jennings is beginning to hit his stride after attempting to play through broken ribs in the early portion of the schedule. The physical wideout is averaging 4.6 receptions and 50.4 yards over his last five appearances. Jennings' recent string of consistent production puts him in the mix as a WR3/flex option in fantasy against the Browns on Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Zach Charbonnet (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Charbonnet was limited to a season-low six touches, with Kenneth Walker totaling 14. Charbonnet still delivered a familiar line, specifically finding success near the goal line as he plunged into the end zone from five yards away midway through the third quarter. Even if Charbonnet's role slips overall, he remains the preferred back in short-yardage situations. That will likely lead to boom-or-bust fantasy performances, though he does have seven scores in 10 games on the campaign.
</div>

### 🟢 Kenneth Walker III (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Walker suffered a glute injury late in the week and entered Sunday with a questionable tag, though he still comfortably led Seattle's backfield with 14 touches as compared to six for Zach Charbonnet. As has often been the case, Walker was the more efficient back, with four of his 11 carries going for more than 10 yards. He also remained more involved as a pass catcher, logging three catches for the second consecutive game and for the third time this season. The only downside to Walker's performance came around the goal line, as he was stuffed from the two-yard line and then ceded an opportunity from the five to Charbonnet later in the game. Overall, it was still a positive performance for Walker as he topped 100 yards from scrimmage for the second consecutive contest.
</div>

### 🟡 Terry McLaurin (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
