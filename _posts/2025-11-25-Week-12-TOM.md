## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟡 Marvin Harrison Jr. (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 Jacoby Brissett (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Brissett continued his gun-slinging ways by eclipsing 300 passing yards for the third time in six starts filling in for Kyler Murray (foot). The 32-year-old Brissett failed to extend his streak of throwing multiple touchdown passes to six games, but it was still another impressive effort from a fantasy perspective. Brissett did leave the game briefly in the second half to be evaluated by the medical staff after taking a big hit, but he promptly returned to action and finished the remainder of the game plus overtime without issue. The journeyman backup has already been named Arizona's starter for the remainder of the season, so fantasy managers who took a chance on Brissett during his current run as starter can feel comfortable continuing to roll him out on a weekly basis. The Cardinals will hit the road in Week 13 to face the Buccaneers, who currently sit in the bottom third of the league in terms yards allowed to opposing quarterbacks.
</div>

### 🟡 Dalton Kincaid (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 Jared Goff (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The veteran QB struggled early, but Goff led the Lions to 10 points in the fourth quarter to complete a late comeback, before Jahmyr Gibbs broke free for a 69-yard touchdown run on the first play of OT. Goff has an 8:2 TD:INT in four games since Detroit's bye, but he'll face what should be a tougher test in Week 13 during a Thanksgiving clash with the Packers.
</div>

### 🟢 Romeo Doubs (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Doubs' numbers certainly were disappointing from a fantasy perspective, but they were generated within the confines of a modest 14-completion, 139-yard passing day for Jordan Love. The veteran wideout has just 81 combined receiving yards over his last three contests overall, but a Thanksgiving Day showdown with the Lions at Ford Field figures to be a game in which the entire Packers' air attack sees increased usage.
</div>

### 🟢 Jayden Higgins (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The rookie wideout led the team in targets while checking in second in receptions, as he continued to display plenty of chemistry with fill-in signal-caller Davis Mills. The rookie second-round pick added his fourth career touchdown grab -- including his second in the three games Mills has started -- on an eight-yard catch just before halftime. Higgins has at least four receptions in three straight contests, but he'll likely return to working with C.J. Stroud (concussion) as his quarterback in a Week 13 road matchup against the Colts on Sunday, Nov. 30.
</div>

### 🟢 Tyler Warren (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Warren co-led the Colts in receptions and was second in both receiving yards and targets on an afternoon when Daniel Jones threw for a modest 181 yards at 5.8 yards per attempt. The rookie tight end has recorded at least four catches in eight consecutive games, although he's hit the 70-yard mark only twice in that span. Warren will head into a Week 13 home matchup against the Texans with a 55-662-3 line on 74 targets across 11 games.
</div>

### 🟡 Ashton Jeanty (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> When asked if the injury could limit Jeanty in practice this week ahead of next Sunday's game against the Chargers, Carroll said, "I haven't heard that it would yet. It sounds like there's a chance that he'll be okay." Despite the Raiders losing 24-10 to Cleveland, Jeanty still had a strong game, totaling 108 yards and one touchdown on 25 touches. He had a particularly strong game as a pass catcher, securing all eight of his targets for 50 yards and a score. If Jeanty would need to miss time, Raheem Mostert, Zamir White and Dylan Laube would be options out of the backfield.
</div>

### 🟢 Blake Corum (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> While the final score was another blowout win for the Rams, Tampa Bay successfully snuffed out the Rams' rushing attack; Corum and Kyren Williams combined for just 70 yards and no touchdowns on 19 attempts. After seeing double-digit touches for a three-week stretch, Corum's usage has dropped the past two weeks, with just 15 rushing attempts for 34 yards in that span. The Rams travel to take on the Carolina Panthers in Week 13, and they have been middle-of-the-road against the run in 2025, surrendering 113.1 yards per game on the ground.
</div>

### 🟢 Kayshon Boutte (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Given that he logged an 80 percent snap share Sunday, Boutte appears to be past the hamstring issue that had sidelined him, positioning him to maintain his steady role in the Patriots' WR corps. Drake Maye's tendency to spread the ball around could lead to some quiet games for Boutte, but the 25-446-5 line he's compiled on 33 targets through 10 games highlights the 23-year-old's ceiling.
</div>

### 🟡 Jaxson Dart (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 AJ Barner (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Barner was one of three players to earn four targets, as Jaxon Smith-Njigba dominated opportunity in the Seattle offense. Both of Barner's catches came on the Seahawks' first possession, and he did help the team get into field-goal range to tie the game at 3-3. He has at least three targets in seven of his last eight games, though he's also been held to 35 yards or less five times in that span.
</div>

### 🟢 Tez Johnson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Johnson logged a hefty 86 percent snap share (60 snaps), just three fewer than Emeka Egbuka, but he put together a modest performance overall in a game Baker Mayfield exited early with a shoulder injury. Johnson still found his way to his fifth career touchdown grab on a 14-yard reception with just over five minutes remaining in the first half. Johnson has multiple catches in four of the last five contests, and it was encouraging to see him retain a robust role even during the return of Chris Godwin (fibula). Johnson could cede some snaps to Godwin in a Week 13  home matchup against the Cardinals as Godwin continues to ease back in, but the rookie should still slot in as no worse than the No. 3 receiver while working with either Mayfield or Teddy Bridgewater as his quarterback.
</div>

### 🟢 Chimere Dike (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Dike was at the center of Tennessee's second-half comeback effort, which began with his 90-yard punt return for a score. He also brought the Titans within six points on a one-yard touchdown catch late in the fourth quarter. Dike took advantage of the absence of Calvin Ridley (leg) and Elic Ayomanor (hamstring), and he should play a key role in the offense for the rest of his rookie campaign.
</div>

### 🟢 Chris Rodriguez Jr. (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The third-year RB took the lead in the Washington backfield, getting 16 touches to Jacory Croskey-Merritt's 10 and out-gaining the rookie 85 scrimmage yards to 33. The workload and yardage total were also season highs for Rodriguez, and he's making a solid case to break out of the Commanders' committee and take over the clear No. 1 job on the other side of the team's Week 12 bye. Rodriguez has already set new career highs with 60 carries for 279 rushing yards and three TDs through nine games.
