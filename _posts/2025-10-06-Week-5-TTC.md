## Player Report

#### Bryce Young (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Carolina managed to pull off a comeback from a 17-0 deficit, but Young had an uneven day that included three sacks in addition to his two turnovers. Rico Dowdle also helped carry the offense with his 206-yard, one-touchdown effort, but Young played a key part with a seven-yard touchdown pass to Xavier Legette that kickstarted the rally late in the first half, and he added a four-yard toss to Mitchell Evans that proved to be the game-winning score. Young has thrown for under 200 yards in all but one game this season, so even with the encouraging team result for the Panthers on Sunday, he remains a somewhat shaky fantasy option even in a favorable Week 6 home matchup against the Cowboys.
#### Rico Dowdle (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Stepping into the lead-back role in place of Chuba Hubbard (calf), Dowdle exceeded all expectations in his first opportunity to helm the ground attack in Carolina. Dowdle repeatedly knifed the Dolphins' front seven for big gains, including 43- and 53-yard scampers. Dowdle's otherworldly performance raises an intriguing dilemma for head coach Dave Canales whenever Hubbard is healthy again, but the Panthers can certainly afford to give the latter time to fully heal, especially with Dowdle next getting a crack at the inconsistent defense of his former Cowboys squad in a Week 6 home matchup.
#### Chase Brown (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** The Bengals were scripted out of the run game early on, as they were down by multiple scores for three quarters of the game. Brown had another uninspiring game as a rusher as a result, though he did earn his most involvement as a pass catcher this season. The end result won't provide any reassurance for fantasy managers moving forward, but Brown did deliver a serviceable performance in PPR formats.
#### Jerry Jeudy (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** There was some optimism for Jeudy's outlook with the Browns making a quarterback switch to Dillon Gabriel, but Jeudy instead posted his lowest yardage total in a game this season. Even worse was that he was out-targeted by both David Njoku and Isaiah Bond on an offense that isn't likely to sustain many fantasy-viable pass catchers. This was a tough spot for the Cleveland offense due to travel overseas and a stiff defensive matchup, so Jeudy could be in for a better showing in Week 6 against Pittsburgh.
#### CeeDee Lamb (WR)
**Injury Status:** Out <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** out
#### Dak Prescott (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** For the second straight game, Prescott chucked multiple TDs without having CeeDee Lamb (ankle) on the field, this time hitting Jake Ferguson twice and George Pickens and Javonte Williams once each. Prescott has a 7:0 TD:INT over the last two contests, and Sunday's performance may have been even more impressive considering four of the Cowboys' five starting offensive linemen were sidelined. The veteran QB figures to keep rolling in Week 6 against a Panthers defense that just gave up three passing TDs to Tua Tagovailoa.
#### RJ Harvey (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Harvey remained the clear No. 2 RB behind J.K. Dobbins, who logged 20 carries. Harvey did continue enjoying a bigger role in the passing game than his veteran teammate, but he was at his most productive in his returner role. As long as Dobbins remains healthy and productive, Harvey projects to remain in the same complementary role that's afforded him 8.6 touches per contest heading into a Week 6 matchup against the Jets in London next Sunday.
#### Brenton Strange (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Strange finished in a tie with Brian Thomas for the lead in team targets while leading his club in receptions in a solid overall effort. The 24-year-old tight end has produced 19 receptions for 182 yards through four starts, well ahead of his pace across 17 games last season (40-411-2).  Strange has quietly entered the fantasy conversation at a shallow position as the Jaguars prepare to face Kansas City on Monday Night Football in Week 5.
#### Xavier Worthy (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Per the report, Worthy who has been managing a shoulder issue, felt some swelling in his ankle and was added to Kansas City's injury report, but Rapoport suggests that was precautionary and that the wideout should be available Monday. While that's encouraging, fantasy managers will still want to confirm Worthy's status ahead of Monday's 8:15 p.m. ET kickoff.
#### Patrick Mahomes (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Mahomes turned in a vintage effort, perhaps not coincidentally as the return of Xavier Worthy reinforced his wide receiver corps. Mahomes threw four touchdowns in a regular-season game for the first time since Week 10 of the 2023 season, with all four scores coming in the red zone. He primarily attempted passes in the short areas of the field but still recorded six completions of at least 15 yards. This was Mahomes' first game with multiple touchdowns this season, and it also accounted for his highest yardage total of 2025. If Worthy's shoulder holds up, Mahomes could be in for much improved results as the campaign progresses -- particularly once Rashee Rice (suspension) is eligible to return in Week 7.
#### Darren Waller (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Waller made a splash with a two-touchdown effort in a Week 4 win over the Jets, a game that marked his first regular-season action since the 2023 season. With Tyreek Hill (IR, knee) going down for the season in that contest, Waller figured to see his opportunity rise exponentially beginning with Sunday's game, and that came to fruition. While the majority of the veteran tight end's production came in the first half, Waller still finished second in receptions and receiving yards for Miami on the afternoon while adding a four-yard scoring grab early in the second quarter. Waller figures to remain a key figure in the air attack during a Week 6 home matchup against the Chargers next Sunday.
#### Stefon Diggs (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Diggs saved his best performance of the season to date for the bright lights of Sunday Night Football in a win over one of his former clubs. The 31-year-old star wideout cracked the century mark in receiving yards for the second consecutive week after totaling just 112 yards over his first three appearances with New England. A lack of touchdowns lingers as the only flaw in Diggs' 2025 fantasy resume, but his recent game log proves that he still can produce at an elite level. Diggs should be treated as a WR1 in fantasy when the Patriots visit the Saints next Sunday.
#### Cam Skattebo (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** The rookie RB topped 100 scrimmage yards for the second time in the last three games, but Skattebo's performance was marred by a lost fumble in the red zone that New Orleans safety Jordan Howden returned 86 yards for a TD -- the third of five straight Giant possessions that ended in a turnover. Skattebo is locking down the top job in the New York backfield while Tyrone Tracy (shoulder) is sidelined, and over those last three contests he's racked up 315 scrimmage yards and a rushing touchdown. Even if Tracy remains on the shelf in Week 6, Skattebo will face a tough test against the Eagles.
#### Tyrone Tracy Jr. (RB)
**Injury Status:** Out <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Tracy got back on the practice field Friday for the first time since dislocating his right shoulder Week 3 versus the Chiefs, but the limited session wasn't enough for the Giants to clear him for game action. While Tracy is missing a second consecutive contest, Cam Skattebo will continue to lead New York's backfield, and Devin Singletary will mix in behind him. Tracy's next chance to return to action is Thursday against the Eagles.
#### Bucky Irving (RB)
**Injury Status:** Out <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** out
#### Chris Godwin Jr. (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Godwin saw his efficiency improve from the 30 percent catch rate he posted in his return from injury last week. Unfortunately for fantasy managers, his target count dropped dramatically from the 10 he garnered against the Eagles in Week 4. Godwin's return from an ankle injury sustained in Week 7 of the 2024 season has come along slowly, dampening expectations for the veteran until we see a true return to form. The Buccaneers could still be without top wideout Mike Evans (hamstring) in Week 6, which would keep Godwin in the starting lineup against the 49ers next Sunday.
