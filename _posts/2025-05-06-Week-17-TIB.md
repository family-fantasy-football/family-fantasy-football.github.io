## Player Report

#### Cole Kmet (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** In 2024, Kmet recorded 47 receptions for 474 yards and four touchdowns on 55 targets, marking his least productive season since his rookie year in 2020. After playing 87 percent of the offensive snaps last season, Kmet now faces significant competition following the first-round selection of Loveland, whose arrival could sharply reduce his role. Although Loveland is expected to be an adequate blocker, the Bears likely drafted the former Michigan standout for his ability to create mismatches in the passing game. Unless the situation shifts during training camp, Kmet may go undrafted in the majority of fantasy leagues.
#### Tee Higgins (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Higgins and Cincinnati were able to come to an agreement on a long-term deal after the wide receiver had been franchise tagged for the second straight year. The 26-year-old caught 73 of 109 targets for 911 yards and 10 touchdowns over 12 regular-season games in 2024, and he'll now remain a Bengal for the foreseeable future. Teammate Ja'Marr Chase and the team also agreed on a four-year, $161 million contract extension Sunday, so the formidable wideout duo will continue to cause problems for defenses for years to come.
#### Mike Gesicki (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Gesicki joined the Bengals on a one-year, $2.5 million contract in March of 2024 after spending the 2023 season with the Patriots and the first five years of his NFL career with the Dolphins. After logging 61 catches in the two seasons prior to 2024, Gesicki had a nice bounce-back campaign in Cincinnati, where he registered 65 catches (on 83 targets) for 665 yards and two touchdowns across 17 regular-season games. Gesicki had six games in which he tallied at least 50 receiving yards, and the 2018 second-round pick out of Penn State will continue to serve as Joe Burrow's security blanket in the passing game.
#### Michael Pittman Jr. (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The wideout expressed confidence that his rehab work has been sufficient to get past his back injury, per James Boyd of The Athletic. Last year, Pittman reported pain in training camp but managed to suit up for 16 regular-season games. The 27-year-old said that he's already had the opportunity to work out with new quarterback Daniel Jones, though Pittman's schedule hasn't yet overlapped with that of Anthony Richardson (back), Boyd reports. Jones and Richardson will have an open competition for the starting role, but whoever wins the starting gig, Pittman, Alec Pierce and Josh Downs will be positioned to headline Indianapolis' wide receiver corps.
#### Trevor Lawrence (QB)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** IR <br>
**Details:** Lawrence underwent surgery on his left, non-throwing shoulder Dec. 17 and was in a sling until late January. While the Jaguars plan to bring him along slowly, he's expected to be fully cleared for the start of training camp later this summer. "We're optimistic that we'll get there in terms of where we need to go," coach Liam Coen said Wednesday. "He'll be on a pitch count for those things. In terms of the where he has to get to, because he has little touch points he needs to reach before he can obviously get out onto the grass and do it full speed, everything's moving forward. He feels really good right now, so excited about that." Lawrence relayed that he's "very optimistic" he'll be ready well ahead of Week 1.
#### Raheem Mostert (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The Raiders never figured to settle for the 33-year-old Mostert as their lead back, unchallenged, but there was at least some chance he'd compete to be 1A in a committee. He instead figures to be purely a backup, behind one of the best RB prospects in recent memory. The good news for Mostert is weak competition for backup roles, with the Raiders otherwise rostering Zamir White (quadriceps), Sincere McCormick (ankle), Dylan Laube and Chris Collier.
#### Quentin Johnston (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** The Chargers' top receiver, Ladd McConkey, is at his best working from the slot, yet also figures to get playing time in two-wide formations (as was the case for much of last season). Johnston thus finds himself in a tricky situation, despite being a recent first-round pick (22nd overall in 2023) who improved considerably between Years 1 and 2. The improved version was still wildly inconsistent, memorably putting up 186 yards in Week 18 before going catch-less (on five targets) in a wild-card round loss at Houston. Johnston is good with the ball in his hands, especially relative to other big WRs, but Harris may prove superior at getting open and catching the ball. There's also some chance, though perhaps a slim one, that Williams emerges as a real threat again, now two years removed from an ACL tear and returning to Los Angeles after a one-year sabbatical. The good news for those interested in Johnston is that his already-modest ADP figures to drop even further after the Harris pick.
#### Russell Wilson (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** The Giants have been in search of a new starting quarterback since moving on from Daniel Jones last season, and Wilson seemingly will be the choice for them to begin 2025, even with fellow offseason signing Jameis Winston on the roster and the draft still to come. Wilson will receive $10.5 million guaranteed upon signing, with the potential to make $21 million this season. In 11 regular-season appearances (all starts) in his only campaign with the Steelers in 2024, he completed 214 of 336 passes (63.7 percent) for 2,482 yards, 16 touchdowns and five interceptions, had 43 carries for 155 yards and two more TDs and fumbled five times (four lost).
#### Mike Evans (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Evans' restructured deal will allow Tampa Bay greater room to maneuver as the team continues to work through free agency and prepare for the 2025 NFL Draft. Coming off his 11th consecutive 1,000-yard season, and with teammate Chris Godwin (knee - ACL) having re-signed with the Buccaneers, Evans is primed to run things back with quarterback Baker Mayfield in a familiar -- and ideal -- situation. Evans will turn 32 less than a month before the 2025 regular season kicks off in what will be a contract year. He's yet to show any signs of slowing down and remains positioned as Mayfield's go-to receiving option, though former offensive coordinator Liam Cohen's departure to take on the Jaguars' head coaching position is notable. Replacing Cohen via the internal promotion of last year's pass-game coordinator, Josh Grizzard, still gives the Buccaneers' offense some amount of continuity at the coordinator spot.
#### Tyler Lockett (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Lockett spent the first 10 seasons of his career in Seattle but was cut ahead of the new league year in a salary cap move. The 32-year-old wideout is coming off of a down 2024 campaign that saw him post a 49-600-2 receiving line as the third option in the Seahawks' passing game. In Tennessee, Lockett figures to fill the old Tyler Boyd role from last season, sliding in as a veteran slot man on the tail end of his career. Look for the Titans to add more pass-catching help in this week's NFL Draft.
