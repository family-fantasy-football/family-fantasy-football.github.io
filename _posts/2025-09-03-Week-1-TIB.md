## Player Report

#### Kyler Murray (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Murray and the rest of the starters handled the first two possessions of the Cardinals' preseason opener against Kansas City on Aug. 9, but the first-team offense appears to have shown enough in practices since for Gannon to feel confident heading into Week 1. A consistent drumbeat throughout training camp has been the improved connection between Murray and second-year wideout Marvin Harrison, an encouraging development considering that Arizona made no notable changes to its skill-position personnel from last season. Murray and Harrison's next opportunity to demonstrate their purportedly improved rapport will arrive during the regular-season opener in New Orleans on Sunday, Sept. 7.
#### Darnell Mooney (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** It's the second promising sign this week, after Mooney avoided an injury list on cutdown day, which suggests the Falcons expect him to play at some point in September. The return to practice Thursday seemingly even gives Mooney a shot to play Week 1 against Tampa Bay, with 10 days to ramp up after missing practice for a little over a month. The Falcons haven't done anything to upgrade their WR room in the meantime -- perhaps another hint at confidence in Mooney's September availability
#### Mark Andrews (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Andrews didn't practice Monday, but if he was dealing with any sort of injury, it appears it was only minor. Ravens general manager Eric DeCosta said Wednesday that he expects Isaiah Likely (foot) to be "back in the early part of the season," per Jamison Hensley of ESPN.com, but it remains to be seen whether Likely will be a candidate to return in time to suit up Week 1 versus the Bills. If Likely misses any regular-season games, Andrews will figure to see an uptick in targets and snaps while Charlie Kolar steps into the No. 2 tight end role.
#### Keon Coleman (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Allen said Coleman is "still seeing a lot of growth in his game and just the nuance to playing the receiver position and doing the things that we're asking him to do," and that the second-year pro has "consistently" been "a guy that can go and win" in one-on-one situations. With top wideout Khalil Shakir expected back for Week 1, but considered week-to-week due to a high-ankle sprain and currently not practicing, Coleman appears to be making the most of his increased opportunities. The 2024 second-round pick was primarily deployed as a downfield target as a rookie, but Buffalo's addition of deep threat Joshua Palmer in free agency could open up a path for Coleman to see more flexible, fantasy-friendly utilization Year 2. Coleman's size, body control, and potential to dominate in one-on-one situations provide him the upside of developing into a go-to red zone target for Allen, something the Bills lacked last season.
#### Tetairoa McMillan (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** McMillan was sidelined a little more than a week due to a minor hamstring injury, but getting back on the field more than a week before Week 1 prep begins bodes well for the eighth overall pick in this year's draft. It remains to be seen if he'll avoid the injury report entirely once Carolina is required to post one ahead of their season opener against Jacksonville.
#### Javonte Williams (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Signed to a one-year, $3 million deal in free agency this spring, Williams faced little competition in training camp as both  Miles Sanders and rookie Jaydon Blue dealt with injuries. The Cowboys also treated Williams as the starter during the preseason, as he didn't play in any of those three exhibitions. Despite those encouraging signs, Williams could end up serving as the lead option in a committee rather than operating as a true bell cow. The uncertainty of Williams' workload, coupled with the lack of efficiency he showed during his final two seasons in Denver after suffering a severe knee injury in 2022, make it difficult to insert him in fantasy lineups with much confidence this week.
#### Isaac TeSlaa (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Lions coach Dan Campbell said after the Lions' preseason finale 26-7 loss to Houston, in which TeSlaa caught both his targets for 41 yards and a touchdown, that the 2025 third-round pick is "going to have some growing pains" but that "we're very pleased with where he's at after six weeks of camp" and "if you took most receivers, he'd be in the upper echelon of those, as far as development" at this stage of his rookie season. Patrick operated as the No. 3 receiver for Detroit much of last season, and his departure now leaves that role up immediately for grabs between TeSlaa and Kalif Raymond.
#### Josh Jacobs (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Jacobs suited up for the second time this preseason and once again made a very quick appearance. He took a carry on the first play of the game and then departed the contest to ensure he's ready for a Week 1 matchup against the Lions. Jacobs should be in line for a heavy workload once again as the Packers' clear workhorse back.
#### Nick Chubb (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The Texans will make Mixon's placement on reserve/NFI official Tuesday. Mixon hasn't practiced at all this summer and now will miss at least the first four games of the regular season, leaving the door open for Chubb, rookie Woody Marks and veterans Dameon Pierce and Dare Ogunbowale to jockey for backfield work. Chubb was rested for the preseason finale this past weekend, suggesting he's the leader for the early-down role over Pierce. Marks and Ogunbowale profile more as pass-catching backs, though Marks certainly could grow into a larger role. Chubb has played in just 10 regular-season games over the last two seasons due to yet another severe knee injury, and he looked sluggish on 102 carries in 2024, turning them into 332 yards (3.3 yards per carry) and three touchdowns with Cleveland. He also doesn't catch many passes, muting his fantasy appeal. Marks, a fourth-round rookie, comes at a cheaper cost in drafts and is five years younger with less wear and tear on his body.
#### Quentin Johnston (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Chargers head coach John Harbaugh had already confirmed Monday that Johnston cleared the NFL's five-step concussion protocol, and the third-year wideout's absence from the injury report suggests that he practiced fully Tuesday and will be available for Friday's season opener versus the Chiefs in Sao Paulo, Brazil. While Johnston projects to begin the 2025 campaign as a starter, the Chargers' offseason additions of veteran Keenan Allen and rookie second-round pick Tre Harris could cut into Johnston's target share and playing time.
#### Justin Jefferson (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Jefferson has been sidelined since late July by what has been described as a mild left hamstring strain, but the star wide receiver is ready to start ramping up his activity level. Per Kevin Seifert of ESPN.com, Jefferson will participate in part of Monday's practice. Though Jefferson hasn't yet been cleared to participate in team drills without limitations, this development nonetheless is a step in the right direction. Jefferson's goal is to be ready for Week 1 against the Bears on Monday, Sept. 8, but he's unlikely to suit up for Friday's preseason finale against the Titans.
#### TreVeyon Henderson (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** After an electric kickoff-return TD in the Patriots' exhibition opener last weekend, Henderson found paydirt again Saturday, this time on an eight-yard run on the team's second possession of the afternoon that saw the rookie running back demonstrate both patience and his ability to power though contact. Rhamondre Stevenson (undisclosed) remains atop the depth chart, but it may just be a show of deference to the veteran after Henderson was selected 38th overall in the 2025 Draft to be one of the centerpieces of the offense.
#### Malik Nabers (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Nabers dealt with numerous health concerns in recent months, sitting out the offseason program due to a toe injury that dates back to college and also bothered him during a standout rookie season, then suffering a shoulder injury early in training camp before tightness in his back popped up. He didn't play at all during the preseason, but he returned to practice last Monday and appeared to have no limitations while running at Wednesday's session. Afterward, he said, "Yeah, I feel like I'm always ready. When it's game time and those lights are on, I believe my body's going to turn it on." Next Wednesday's injury report will reveal whether or not Nabers has any limitations ahead of a Week 1 road matchup with the Commanders on Sunday, Sept. 7.
#### Justin Fields (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Fields started New York's first two preseason games but handled a total of just three offensive possessions. Per Zack Rosenblatt of The Athletic, Fields has rarely thrown the ball downfield throughout training camp, with New York's offense instead focusing on the run game and short-area passes. That observation is reinforced by the fact that he's averaging just 3.9 air yards per attempt across his limited exhibition action, and that all four of Fields' targets to No. 1 receiver Garrett Wilson this preseason have fallen incomplete. Glenn admitted after Saturday's preseason loss to the Giants that "our passing game has to be better," saying that "our guys know we're going to put our heads down and go back to work." Fields' rushing abilities have been sufficient to provide fantasy upside in the past, but for him to enter the mix as a consistent QB1 this season, the Jets' passing game will have to establish a better rhythm before a Week 1 contest against Pittsburgh.
