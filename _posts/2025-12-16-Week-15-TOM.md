## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟡 Marvin Harrison Jr. (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 Jacoby Brissett (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> For the second straight game, the Arizona defense coughed up at least 40 points, letting another strong performance from Brissett go to waste. The three TDs -- two to Trey McBride and one to Michael Wilson -- were a season high for the veteran QB, but Brissett has tossed multiple scores in eight of the last nine games, posting an impressive 18:6 TD:INT since taking over for Kyler Murray (foot) in Week 6. Brissett will look to establish a new career high in passing TDs on the season in Week 16 against the Falcons.
</div>

### 🟢 Dalton Kincaid (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Kincaid and fellow tight end Dawson Knox finished with the same number of catches, but the latter was on the receiving end of two Josh Allen touchdown passes. Kincaid has posted a 7-75-1 line on nine targets in two games since returning from a three-game absence due to a hamstring injury, affording him modest fantasy value heading into a Week 16 road matchup against the Browns next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 James Cook III (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Facing a notoriously stingy Patriots run defense, Cook carefully picked his spots throughout the afternoon and consistently churned out productive gains. He was a critical contributor to the Bills' second-half rally, recording three- and 11-yard touchdown runs. Those scoring scampers were preceded by a five-yard scoring grab with just under two minutes remaining in the first half, giving Cook his first three-TD tally of the season. The star running back figures to be heavily involved again in a Week 16 road matchup against the Browns next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Jared Goff (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Matthew Stafford bested Goff in a battle of quarterbacks who were traded for each other back in 2021. The latter actually finished with the superior fantasy score after Goff set a new season high in passing yards. It was the fourth time this season that the Cal product threw for three touchdowns with no interceptions, resulting in a sparkling 5.8 TD/INT through 14 starts. Goff will look to continue his strong fantasy campaign when the Lions host the Steelers next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Romeo Doubs (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Doubs remained in a muted role, and he's now been held to four or fewer targets in five of his last six games. He has also topped 50 yards only once in that span. The potential absence of Christian Watson (chest) could increase Doubs' opportunity in a Week 16 matchup against the Bears, though both Jayden Reed and Matthew Golden currently look to be a higher priority for targets in the Green Bay offense.
</div>

### 🟢 Jayden Higgins (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> It was a disappointing outing for Higgins, who was held to just one target for the first time since Week 9 and the fifth time on the season. It broke his five-game streak of at least five targets, as Dalton Schultz (8-76-1 on nine targets) and Nico Collins (3-85-2 on four targets) paced the Texans' pass catchers during Sunday's blowout win. Higgins will look to bounce back in Week 16 against the Raiders, whose defense yielded three touchdown passes to Jalen Hurts during their 31-0 loss to the Eagles on Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Tyler Warren (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Warren was limited to meager production on six targets in consecutive weeks, highlighting the effect the loss of QB Daniel Jones (Achilles) early in Week 14 has had on the Colts' position players. It was a tough ask for 44-year-old Philip Rivers to save the team's passing attack, so Warren's recent drop-off shouldn't come as a huge surprise to fantasy managers. The 23-year-old Warren may have to make his mark on short underneath routes against the 49ers on Monday Night Football in Week 16.
</div>

### 🟢 Ashton Jeanty (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jeanty saw his rushing opportunity curtailed by game script, as the Eagles already held a 17-0 lead by halftime. The rookie first-round pick finished with the second-most receptions on the Raiders, who were being quarterbacked by backup Kenny Pickett. Jeanty's fantasy outlook remains perpetually capped by the team's circumstances on his side of the ball, and the outlook only gets more worrisome in Week 16 when Las Vegas travels to face an elite Texans defense.
</div>

### 🔴 Omarion Hampton (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Hampton outpaced backfield mate Kimani Vidal by three carries and 28 rushing yards while also recording a game-long 26-yard run. The rookie upped his workload by one over that of his Week 14 return from an ankle injury, but the workload between both backs may vary week to week down the stretch as head coach Jim Harbaugh looks to keep both players fresh.
</div>

### 🟢 Blake Corum (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Corum kept up his recent string of hot play in fantasy by scoring his fifth touchdown of the season in the second half of Sunday's shootout win. Four of the five scores have come over the talented backup's last three appearances, a span in which he is also averaging 9.3 yards per carry. Kyren Williams (15-78-2) is still the lead back for the Rams, and Corum's value is being boosted by some favorable situations combined with unsustainable efficiency. Fantasy managers should continue to ride Corum's wave of production while also being aware that his touches are capped while sitting behind Williams on the depth chart.
</div>

### 🟢 Kayshon Boutte (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Boutte was limited to one or zero catches for the first time since Week 9, but he was still able to finish second on the team in receiving yards behind fellow wideout Mack Hollins (41). Boutte has been a real boom-or-bust option this season, finding the end zone in five different contests while also having five performances in which he was limited to 30 or fewer yards. The wide receiver will look to put together a more prolific stat line in Week 16 against the Ravens.
</div>

### 🟢 Jaxson Dart (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Once again, the rookie quarterback took a hit that forced him out of the game to get checked for a concussion, but he quickly returned to the game after being replaced by Jameis Winston for two plays in the fourth quarter. Per Pat Leonard of the New York Daily News, it's the fifth time this season Dart's been sent to the blue tent to be evaluated for a concussion, although he's only been diagnosed with one. In two games since his return from that two-week absence, Dart's completed 61.7 percent of his passes with a 3:1 TD:INT and 6.4 YPA. He'll try to make it through his first NFL season without further injury beginning in Week 16 against the Vikings.
</div>

### 🟢 AJ Barner (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Barner has been targeted 19 times over the last four weeks, turning in 12 receptions for 107 yards and no touchdowns. After starting the season with four touchdowns through the first five games, Barner has been kept out of the end zone for nine straight contests. The second-year tight end remains the Seahawks' clear No. 1 at the position however, especially with rookie Elijah Arroyo (knee) done for the rest of the regular season.
</div>

### 🟢 Tez Johnson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Johnson saw both Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan return to the field Thursday, making it wholly unsurprising the rookie was limited to just one target and logged his lowest snap count (15) since his Week 1 NFL debut. Johnson was unable to convert that single look into a catch, making it two straight games without a reception. Provided the Buccaneers' receiving corps remains at full strength for the team's remaining three regular-season games, Johnson figures to be a fantasy afterthought.
</div>

### 🟢 Chimere Dike (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Dike was limited primarily to work on special teams early in the game, with three of his five targets coming on Tennessee's final two possessions of the contest. He now has at least four targets in each of his last four games, but Dike has topped 25 yards only once in that span. He's likely to continue to get opportunities down the stretch as Tennessee builds for the future, but his production will be unreliable.
</div>

### 🟡 Chris Rodriguez Jr. (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>
