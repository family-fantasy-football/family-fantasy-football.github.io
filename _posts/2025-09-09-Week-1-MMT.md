## Player Report

#### Khalil Shakir (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Shakir showed no ill effects from the high-ankle sprain that sidelined him during training camp, as he finished second on the team in targets, catches and receiving yards behind Keon Coleman, who had 112 yards and a touchdown on 11 targets. Shakir led the Bills in all three categories last season, but the emergence of Coleman and addition of Joshua Palmer in the offseason gives Shakir more competition for attention from Josh Allen heading into a Week 2 road game against the Jets.
#### Jake Ferguson (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Ferguson finished second in receptions on the Cowboys to CeeDee Lamb and third in receiving yards, although the latter total was a reflection of a low-volume passing night for Dallas. Nevertheless, it was encouraging to see Ferguson as Dak Prescott's second-favorite target on the night, as it was a reminder of the chemistry between the two that was nullified by Prescott's season-ending hamstring avulsion in Week 9 of last season. Ferguson could remain similarly busy during the Cowboys' Week 2 home opener against the Giants on Sunday, Sept. 14.
#### George Pickens (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** The big-name offseason addition didn't see Dak Prescott look his way anywhere near as much as CeeDee Lamb, but Pickens made some solid contributions in the narrow loss. The talented receiver made his first regular-season catch as a Cowboy on a six-yard grab during Dallas' opening drive, and he'd go on to draw a 34-yard pass interference penalty on Quinyon Mitchell before the quarter was over. Pickens also had a key 15-yard grab  on third down with just under three minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, but he was guilty of an unnecessary roughness penalty deep in Eagles territory in the third quarter on a drive that culminated in a Miles Sanders fumble. Pickens is naturally expected to settle into the Cowboys' air attack the more he plays, and a Week 2 home matchup against the Giants on Sunday, Sept. 14 could represent an opportunity for his first breakout performance.
#### RJ Harvey (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Harvey alternated drives with J.K. Dobbins for most of the first half, though the Broncos relied heavily on Dobbins down the stretch to secure a victory in positive game script. The end result was that Harvey was out-touched 18-7 by Dobbins, but Harvey still managed to show off his explosiveness on a 50-yard run early in the fourth quarter, which ultimately set up a Dobbins score. While Harvey looks to be the second back in Denver for the time being, he still has a clear role in the offense and could see that expand if he continues to prove himself as a pro.
#### Jahmyr Gibbs (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** There was plenty of offseason speculation that Gibbs would take over the backfield from David Montgomery, though Montgomery had 11 carries to Gibbs' nine. Gibbs still managed to salvage his day with a team-leading 10 catches, but he also found running room hard to come by in that context. Week 1 was a disastrous game for the Detroit offense overall, so a Week 2 matchup with the Bears should allow Gibbs to bounce back while also potentially clarifying his role in a more typical game script.
#### Woody Marks (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Marks, a 2025 fourth-round draft pick, entered the regular season as the fourth back on the depth chart, and nothing about Sunday's usage changed that. He's solidly behind Nick Chubb, Dameon Pierce and Dare Ogunbowale and will have to be patient and wait for his opportunities.
#### Bhayshul Tuten (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The rookie fourth-round pick finished fourth among Jacksonville's tailbacks with just four offensive snaps, though he still garnered three carries in the blowout. Both Tuten and rookie seventh rounder LeQuint Allen had minimal roles in the season opener, but the No. 2 job is wide open after the Jaguars traded Tank Bigsby to the Eagles on Monday. Travis Etienne is locked in as the starter after posting 156 yards from scrimmage Week 1, but Tuten and Allen are now positioned to compete for the backup job.
#### Tre' Harris (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Harris, a 2025 second-round pick, played just five offensive snaps, while sixth-rounder KeAndre Lambert-Smith played 14. Quarterback Justin Herbert targeted each rookie just once, however, and Lambert-Smith finished Week 1 without a catch. Ladd McConkey, Keenan Allen and Quentin Johnston dominated opportunities in the passing game, combining for 26 targets, and the three appear solidified as a starting trio atop the Chargers' wide receiver depth chart. Harris thus looks destined to reprise a depth role in Week 2 against the Raiders on Monday night, and any path for him to see significantly increased opportunities in the near future could depend on one of McConkey, Allen or Johnston missing time.
#### Davante Adams (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Adams finished second in targets, receptions and receiving yards in a successful debut for the Rams after inking a two-year, $46 million deal this past offseason. The 32-year-old's poor catch rate (50 percent) could be attributed to lack of preseason reps with Matthew Stafford while the QB dealt with an ailing back. Adams' pursuit of a sixth straight 1,000-yard receiving season continues in a road tilt against the Titans next Sunday.
#### T.J. Hockenson (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** The Vikings' passing attack was mostly quiet the majority of the night as J.J. McCarthy made his NFL regular-season debut, helping lead to a modest showing for the veteran tight end. Hockenson entered the season with elevated expectations considering he's now nearly two years removed from suffering multiple knee ligament tears Week 16 of the 2023 season, but his production will naturally be largely dependent on how quickly McCarthy gets his feet under him. Hockenson will next take aim at the Falcons defense in a Week 2 home matchup on Sunday night.
#### Drake Maye (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Beginning what is to be his first full season as a starter, Maye fought an uphill battle for most of the afternoon in a game where the Patriots found themselves down 7-0 after the opening possession. He would ultimately help keep New England competitive with a two-yard touchdown toss to DeMario Douglas to knot the score at 7-7 later in the first quarter, and he would also lead a late 10-play drive that would culminate in a field goal and put New England within seven points. Maye did an excellent job spreading the ball around by recording completions to nine different pass catchers, and he'll head into a Week 2 divisional road battle against what was a generous Dolphins secondary in Week 1 with plenty of momentum.
#### Alvin Kamara (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** The veteran RB showed he had plenty of juice left in the tank on the Saints' only TD of the game, an 18-yard scamper early in the second quarter, but Kamara otherwise didn't find much running room. Kellen Moore's new offense leaned heavily on the passing game as Spencer Rattler attempted a career-high 46 passes, but that may not be a detriment to Kamara's production given his proven ability as a receiver. He'll look to make an impact again at home Week 2 against the 49ers.
#### Ricky Pearsall (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Pearsall took on an expanded role after George Kittle (hamstring) and Jauan Jennings (shoulder) did not return from their respective injuries suffered in Sunday's victory. The 24-year-old Pearsall was up to the task, ripping off multiple big-chunk plays en route to his first 100-yard game of 2025. The University of Florida product was already expected to have a breakout season entering his second year, but he could be asked to do even more if either Kittle or Jennings is forced to miss time. Pearsall will attempt to build off of this promising start when the 49ers take on the Saints next Sunday.
