## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Bijan Robinson (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The third-year RB reached 1,000 rushing yards for the season on his first carry, but that might have been the high point of the day for the Atlanta offense. Robinson saw his streak of games with at least 100 scrimmage yards end at three, and through 13 contests he's produced 1,081 rushing yards and five TDs along with a 56-604-2 line on 70 targets. He'll look to get back to triple digits in yardage in a Week 15 tilt against Tampa Bay.
</div>

### 🟢 Xavier Legette (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The second-year pro from South Carolina didn't benefit from the Panthers' run-heavy approach (40 rush attempts) during Sunday's win, failing to reach double-digit receiving yards for the third time this season. When Carolina did pass, Legette was outshined by Jalen Coker and Tetairoa McMillan, who combined to catch five of eight targets for 117 yards and two touchdowns. Legette now has 28 catches on 53 targets for 287 yards and three touchdowns through 11 games, and his week-to-week volatility makes him a risky fantasy option for the remainder of the year.
</div>

### 🟢 Colston Loveland (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Loveland didn't see his first target until the final minute of the second quarter, when he hauled in an 11-yard pass from Caleb Williams. Loveland was more active in the second half, and he helped tie things up at 21-21 with a one-yard touchdown pass from Williams. Loveland finished second on the Bears in targets behind Luther Burden (six), and the rookie tight end has recorded four catches or more in four of his last six games. The Michigan tight end has a 35-435-4 line on 49 targets through 12 regular-season games.
</div>

### 🟢 Dylan Sampson (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Sampson played through a hamstring concern and delivered a standout effort as a receiver, finishing as Shedeur Sanders' second-most-targeted pass catcher while posting the team's second-highest reception total. Sampson matched a career high in receiving yards in the process, and he's now contributed at least five receptions on three occasions during his rookie campaign. Sampson should continue in his change-of-pace role alongside Quinshon Judkins in a Week 15 road clash with the 49ers.
</div>

### 🟢 Bo Nix (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Nix was methodical against the Raiders' coverage Sunday, completing over 80 percent of his pass attempts en route to earning his team's 11th victory of the season. The Broncos played an excellent game of ball control, nearly doubling the opposition's 20:57 time of possession. This was exhibited best on Denver's opening drive that ate up just under nine minutes of game clock, which culminated in Nix's fourth rushing touchdown of the season, tying the mark he set last year as a rookie. The Broncos' special teams and running game finished off the Raiders, which helped contribute to the signal-caller's pedestrian individual contribution to fantasy managers' box scores in Week 14. Nix will face a stiffer test next time out when the Broncos host the Packers next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Emanuel Wilson (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> It was not long ago that Wilson racked up 12 touches against the Giants and a whopping 30 touches against the Vikings with starting running back Josh Jacobs exiting the first contest due to injury and sitting out the second one altogether, but Jacobs handled the bulk of the backfield work in his Week 13 return, and he did the same Sunday. With Jacobs healthy and the Packers potentially playing must-win games the rest of the way, it's looking like Jacobs will be the bell cow while Wilson spells the starter as needed.
</div>

### 🟡 Parker Washington (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 Brashard Smith (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Smith played just five snaps and didn't see a touch on offense following Isiah Pacheco's return from a three-game absence due to a knee injury. Smith figures to see seldom use on offense in games for which Pacheco and Kareem Hunt are both active, though Smith should continue to see work on kickoffs as a returner.
</div>

### 🟡 Geno Smith (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Following the game, coach Pete Carroll said that Smith's shoulder "locked up" after he completed a pass late in the third quarter, which paved the way for Kenny Pickett to play the remainder of the contest. In terms of Smith's Week 15 status, Carroll noted that an early test revealed that the QB (who also sustained a cut on his right hand versus Denver) had avoided serious damage to his shoulder, while adding that he'll lean toward starting the veteran signal-caller Nov.14 against the Eagles, health permitting.
</div>

### 🟢 Kyren Williams (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Williams entered Sunday's contest with no injury designation and was not limited by the minor ankle injury he picked up in last week's loss to Carolina. The 24-year-old starter cashed in his eighth rushing touchdown of the season and 11th overall through 13 contests. Blake Corum's 12-128-2 rushing line will stand out in the box score, but it is worth noting that a significant portion of the backup's production game in garbage time of the blowout victory. Williams remains the top option in Los Angeles' backfield as the team prepares to host the Lions in Week 15.
</div>

### 🟢 Puka Nacua (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Nacua absolutely went off against the Cardinals' secondary Sunday, averaging a whopping 23.9 yards per reception in the one-sided victory. The BYU product fell just short of the high-water mark of 170 yards he posted back in Week 4, but he still finished with his highest fantasy score to date in 2025 after producing his first multi-score game of the season. Nacua has taken a backseat to co-star WR Davante Adams (4-29-0) at times, but the inverse was true in Week 14. The 24-year-old Nacua just matched his previous career high of six touchdown receptions from his standout rookie campaign, and he currently sits seven catches shy of a second 100-reception season. Fantasy managers should continue to roll out Nacua with confidence for next Sunday's potential shootout against the Lions.
</div>

### 🟢 Tank Bigsby (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Bigsby had received at least one carry in each of the Eagles' last five games prior to Friday's loss. The negative game script likely factored into his lack of playing time, as Philadelphia turned to a pass-catching back in Will Shipley when spelling Saquon Barkley while trailing for nearly the entire game. Despite limited usage, Bisgby has been incredibly efficient in his 11 games with the Eagles, averaging 9.1 yards per carry on just 18 rush attempts. However, he'll likely remain a minimal portion of the team's offensive game plan in the Week 14 matchup against the Chargers.
</div>

### 🟡 Cade Otton (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Buccaneers held a walk-through practice Monday, so a more accurate read on Otton's chances of playing Thursday night against the Falcons should arrive via Tuesday's practice report. Over his last three games, the tight end -- who has yet to score a TD this season -- has averaged three catches, while compiling a total of 49 yards in that span.
</div>

### 🟢 Emeka Egbuka (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Egbuka had arguably the worst game of his nascent career, producing new career lows in receptions and receiving yards. The rookie also dropped a sure touchdown with just under six minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, capping off an outlier of an afternoon overall for the Ohio State product. Egbuka won't have to wait long to atone, as the Falcons come calling for a Week 15 Thursday night matchup later in the week.
</div>

### 🟢 Deebo Samuel (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The four receptions led the Commanders while the six targets tied Terry McLaurin for the team lead, but the volume didn't amount to much yardage. Washington's passing attack struggled even with Jayden Daniels returning to action, but the second-year QB left the game in the third quarter after appearing to aggravate his dislocated left elbow. Regardless of whether Daniels or Marcus Mariota is under center in Week 15 against the Giants, Samuel figures to be involved in the offense -- he's seen at least five targets and caught at least three passes in nine straight appearances, compiling a 46-429-4 line on 60 targets over that stretch.
