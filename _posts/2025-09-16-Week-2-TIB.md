## Player Report

#### Kyler Murray (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** It was a tale of two halves for Murray, who had his team up comfortably going into the break but was barely clinging onto victory when time expired. An untimely interception to end a 70-yard drive in the fourth quarter played a huge role in letting Carolina back into this contest. It was Murray's first interception of the season to go along with his three passing touchdowns and 70 rushing yards through two starts in 2025. The dual-threat QB is shaping up to be a high-floor, low-ceiling fantasy option in a road matchup against a tough 49ers defense next Sunday.
#### Darnell Mooney (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** After missing Week 1 due to a shoulder injury, Mooney didn't have an injury designation heading into Sunday Night Football. He played 57 of 66 offensive snaps during his season debut, which led Atlanta's WRs (Drake London finished with 56). Despite being on the field often, Mooney failed to haul in either of his targets in the first half, and both of his receptions came within three plays during the Falcons' first drive of the second half. The run game was the clear emphasis for Atlanta during Sunday's defensive-dominated game, as Falcons QB Michael Penix attempted only 21 passes after throwing 41 times Week 1. Mooney is the clear No. 2 wideout behind London and will look to get more involved against the Panthers in Week 3. However, it'll be difficult for any pass catchers to deliver consistent production if the Falcons are pushing 40 rushing attempts consistently.
#### Kyle Pitts Sr. (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Despite turning in a modest line, this was a relatively encouraging performance for Pitts. He tied for the team lead in targets and paced all pass catchers in receptions, with his lack of production explained primarily by the Falcons attempting only 21 passes. Pitts now has 11 catches for 96 yards across the first two games of the season and looks to be a favorite target of Michael Penix.
#### Mark Andrews (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Andrews was inexplicably absent from the scoring parade on a night where the Ravens dropped a 40-burger. Perhaps the veteran tight end was still dealing with the undisclosed injury that kept him out of preseason action. Whatever the case, Andrews missed a prime opportunity to operate as the top tight end with Isaiah Likely (foot) sitting this one out. The latter could return as soon as next Sunday's tilt against the Browns, but Andrews didn't inspire confidence in fantasy managers even if Likely misses a second consecutive game.
#### Keon Coleman (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Coleman came back down to earth after recording 112 receiving yards and a touchdown in the season opener, as all three of Buffalo's Week 2 touchdowns came on the ground. The Bills will likely continue to spread the ball around, but the 2024 second-round pick leads the team with 14 targets and 138 receiving yards heading into Thursday's home game against a Dolphins defense that has allowed 33 points to each of its first two opponents.
#### Tetairoa McMillan (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** The eighth-overall pick in this year's draft is living up to the hype, recording the first 100-yard receiving game of his career in just his second pro appearance. McMillan paced the Panthers in targets and yardage after accomplishing the same feat last week, as he's quickly become Bryce Young's most-trusted target out of the gates. The Arizona product is already making fantasy waves before scoring the first touchdown of his career, which is likely just around the corner given the wideout's 6-foot-5 frame and tremendous ball skills. McMillan belongs in starting fantasy lineups heading into a Week 3 matchup against the Falcons next Sunday.
#### Luther Burden III (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Burden has a total of three targets over the first two games, and the rookie is the clear No. 4 receiver in the offense. Burden's biggest contribution to the team has been as a kick returner. It's possible that Burden sees his role grow over the course of the season if he can impress the coaching staff.
#### Javonte Williams (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** After scoring two TDs in a Week 1 loss to the Eagles, Williams churned out another big performance in his second game as a Cowboy, highlighted by a 30-yard run in the third quarter for his third score of the season. The veteran back did benefit from some missed tackles by Giants defenders, but he also showed impressive power, and he continues to solidify his hold on the top job in the Dallas backfield. In Week 3, Williams will take aim at a Bears defense that just got gashed for a combined 151 rushing yards and two touchdowns by the Lions duo of Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery.
#### Isaac TeSlaa (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** TeSlaa was expected to see an increase in workload with the offense Week 2, and he saw his offensive snap count rise from three snaps in Week 1 to 17 against Chicago on Sunday. The wide receiver once again provided a highlight reel catch, securing a leaping one-handed snag up the sideline for 29 yards to get the Lions inside the five-yard line with less than 20 seconds left in the first half. Through two games in 2025, TeSlaa has made two acrobatic catches on the two targets he's garnered, and he'll keep earning more opportunities if he continues to deliver results for Detroit. Fellow wide receiver Kalif Raymond saw his offensive snaps drop from 42 in Week 1 to 32 versus the Bears, so TeSlaa may already be challenging for the No. 3 role behind Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jameson Williams.
#### Nick Chubb (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Chubb was having trouble finding running room for most of this contest before finally ripping off a 25-yard touchdown scamper late in the fourth quarter. The 29-year-old continued dominating Houston's backfield touches sans Joe Mixon (foot/ankle), with rookie Woody Marks' three carries checking in a distant second behind the veteran starter. Chubb is looking like a solid flex candidate Week 3 heading into a potential soft matchup against the Jaguars on Sunday.
#### Quentin Johnston (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Johnson had multiple critical drops in the first quarter, but for a second consecutive week the 24-year-old once again connected with Justin Herbert on a beautiful frozen rope this time for a 60-yard touchdown that proved to be all the scoring necessary to beat the Raiders. The 2023 first-round pick did tie for the team high with seven targets, but unlike Keenan Allen and Ladd McConkey, the majority of Johnston's targets appeared to be scripted and don't necessarily indicate a potential bump in volume on a week-to-week basis.
#### Justin Jefferson (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Jefferson was able to rip off a huge 50-yard gain on Atlanta's defense, but he was otherwise held in check Sunday. QB J.J. McCarthy completed just 11 passes for 158 yards in the ugly loss, with his top wideout accounting for nearly half of his total production. Jefferson has gotten off to a slower start in 2025 with McCarthy (7-125-1) under center compared to the two-week sample we saw with 2024 starter Sam Darnold (8-192-2). Even with the slight drop-off in production, Jefferson remains an unquestioned fantasy WR1 heading into a Week 3 matchup against Ja'Marr Chase and the Bengals next Sunday.
#### TreVeyon Henderson (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Henderson was out-touched by both Rhamondre Stevenson (16) and Antonio Gibson (six) on offense. Stevenson looks like the lead back in New England, at least for now, while Henderson is stuck splitting change-of-pace duties with Gibson. The speedy Henderson has the talent to take on a larger role as the season unfolds, but the rookie second-round pick could be held back by a lack of volume again when the Patriots host the Steelers in Week 3.
#### Malik Nabers (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Russell Wilson turned back the clock with a performance reminiscent of his best days in Seattle, and Nabers was his main target, catching a 29-yard TD in the second quarter and a 48-yard score with just 25 seconds left in the fourth that appeared to have won the game for the Giants before Brandon Aubrey booted a ridiculous 64-yard field goal as time expired to send it to OT. Nabers has seen 25 targets through two games from Wilson, turning that volume into a 14-238-2 line, but he may not face a secondary as weak as Dallas' current unit for the rest of the season. The sixth overall pick in the 2024 Draft will look to prove he's matchup-proof in Week 3 against Kansas City.
#### Justin Fields (QB)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Before his departure from the Jets' 30-10 loss, Fields completed three of 11 pass attempts for 27 yards and added five carries for 49 yards. With the QB's concussion confirmed by the Jets, per Cimini, Fields now will have to progress through the NFL's protocol for head injuries in order to play next weekend against the Buccaneers. If Fields isn't cleared for Week 3 action, Tyrod Taylor would be in line to start in his place.
