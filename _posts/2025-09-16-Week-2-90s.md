## Player Report

#### Lamar Jackson (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** A Browns defense that has traditionally given Jackson some trouble wasn't able to quite contain him as it had in the past, particularly during a second half in which Baltimore's offense compiled 24 points overall. Jackson contributed directly to 21 of those points with touchdown passes of two and 24 yards to Devontez Walker and a 23-yard scoring strike to DeAndre Hopkins. That trio of TD tosses was preceded by a 15-yard connection with Tylan Wallace in the second quarter, giving Jackson his first tally of at least three scoring passes since Week 15 of last season. Jackson has opened 2025 with a 6:0 TD:INT and next faces a Lions team coming off a rout of the Bears in a Week 3 interconference home showdown on Monday night, Sept. 22.
#### Joe Flacco (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Flacco's underwhelming line tells the tale of a sluggish afternoon for the Browns' offense, one during which he took two sacks in addition to his two turnovers. Flacco spread the ball around well but was outmanned by an aggressive Ravens defense and an efficient, mistake-free performance by Lamar Jackson. Flacco was replaced by rookie Dillon Gabriel for the final drive -- which did result in a touchdown -- but Matt Schneidman of The Athletic reports head coach Kevin Stefanski confirmed Flacco would remain the starter for a Week 3 home matchup against the Packers.
#### Quinshon Judkins (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Although Judkins was reportedly ticketed for a modest role in his delayed NFL debut, the rookie ended up leading the Browns in rush attempts and rushing yards on the afternoon. Just over half of Judkins' rushing production came on a 31-yard run, but considering the quality of the defense he was facing and the fact he missed all of training camp and preseason, his performance can't be labeled as anything but encouraging. With Judkins displaying the conditioning to handle double-digit touches right out of the gate, it's possible he paces the ground attack again in a Week 3 home matchup against the Packers next Sunday.
#### Jameson Williams (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Williams was on his way to a second consecutive lackluster game to open the season before he turned on the jets for a 44-yard touchdown reception just past the halfway point of the third quarter. Williams saw his Week 1 catch total cut in half, but his yardage got an 85-yard boost and vaulted him to his first 100-yard effort since Week 16 of last season. Williams will try to break through against the Ravens' secondary in a Week 3 road matchup in Baltimore on Monday night, Sept. 22.
#### Nico Collins (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Quarterback C.J. Stroud wasted no time finding his favorite target in the end zone Monday when he floated a rainbow in to Collins on the Texans' first possession of the game. The athletic receiver made a near-impossible grab where he managed to keep both of his feet in bounds for a millisecond before the momentum of the pass carried him out of the end zone. It wasn't all roses for Collins, as he finished the contest with an abysmal 33 percent catch rate on a team-high nine targets. The end result was still a significant improvement over the star wideout's Week 1 stinker. Collins' next opportunity to put up the consistent WR1 numbers managers have become accustomed to from him will be in a road matchup against the Jaguars on Sunday.
#### Jonathan Taylor (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Taylor delivered a key run of 68 yards early in the fourth quarter to set up a field goal for the Colts while also accounting for the team's longest play from scrimmage. He was efficient on the ground beyond that single carry, logging a pair of both 10 and nine-yard gains. Taylor also got involved as a pass catcher, taking a swing pass for 43 yards late in the first quarter before catching a touchdown on a similar play from seven yards away one quarter later. It was an excellent performance all around and marked the sixth time in Taylor's career that he's topped 200 yards from scrimmage.
#### Brock Bowers (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Bowers was able to suit up after injuring his knee Week 1 and being limited to just one practice Saturday. The budding superstar wore a bulky brace on his left knee but otherwise was unaffected by the injury that threatened his status for Monday's primetime matchup. Bowers' pedestrian stat line was the result of a horrid passing night from QB Geno Smith, who completed just 55 percent of his pass attempts while throwing three interceptions. With the injury scare behind him, Bowers and the entire Las Vegas offense will look to right the ship in a road tilt against the Commanders on Sunday.
#### Jaylen Waddle (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Waddle navigated a shoulder issue throughout the practice week but entered Sunday without an injury designation, and he put up a solid performance overall that saw him finish third in receptions, receiving yards and targets for the Dolphins on the afternoon. The 2021 first-round pick also recorded his first touchdown of the campaign on an 18-yard grab early in the second quarter, and he enjoyed an appreciable boost over his 30-yard effort in Week 1 against the Colts. Waddle and the increasingly desperate Dolphins will have to face the Bills on a short week when the two division rivals clash on Thursday night to kick off Week 3.
#### Tua Tagovailoa (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Tagovailoa and the Dolphins' offense as a whole were in dire straits over the first quarter-plus as the Patriots raced out to a 12-0 lead. Matters took a turn for the better in the second quarter when Tagovailoa hit Jaylen Waddle and De'Von Achane for touchdown passes of 18 and 29 yards, respectively. However, although Tagovailoa was able to compile some yardage in the second half, he wasn't able to lead Miami to anything other than a pair of field goals, as the Dolphins' other second-half points came from a Malik Washington 74-yard punt return touchdown. The Dolphins already have their backs against the wall at 0-2, making Thursday night's Week 3 road matchup against the Bills a critical early-season game for Tagovailoa and his teammates.
#### Jordan Mason (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Coach Kevin O'Connell relayed the news regarding Jones on Monday, and the situation should gain clarity once the Vikings are required to post Week 3 injury reports, starting Wednesday. In any case, Mason already had a leg up on Jones through two games this season, handling 24 carries for 98 yards and gathering in three of four targets for 15 yards, while Jones notched 13 carries for 46 yards and three catches (on four targets) for 44 yards and one touchdown. Assuming Jones is out this weekend, most of his touches will be gobbled up by Mason.
#### Garrett Wilson (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Wilson was the only player to exceed nine receiving yards for the Jets in the ugly Week 2 loss. He's the clear top target in a Jets passing attack that could be orchestrated by Tyrod Taylor in Week 3 against the Buccaneers after Justin Fields sustained a concussion in the fourth quarter of Sunday's defeat. Wilson had three catches for 33 yards in Taylor's two drives following Fields' injury.
#### Calvin Austin III (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Austin looked like he was starting a breakout season after a strong Week 1 showing, but his performance took a significant dip in Week 2. Beyond the lackluster stat line, he ran the wrong route in the end zone late in the third quarter, with the ball ultimately being picked by Seattle. Austin is likely to continue to earn snaps, but his production will also remain inconsistent.
#### Jaylen Warren (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Warren more explicitly accounted for the majority of touches out of Pittsburgh's backfield relative to Week 1, out-touching Kenneth Gainwell 18-8. Warren found very little running room, but he made an impact as a receiver for the second consecutive week. Warren recorded a 65-yard gain, most of which came after the catch, in the middle of the third quarter, during which he bounced off several would-be tacklers before being taken down at the five-yard line. While Warren hasn't had a strong start to the season on the ground, he has six receptions for 108 yards and a touchdown combined across the two contests.
#### Jauan Jennings (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Per Nick Wagoner of ESPN.com, Jennings is viewed as day-to-day as this weekend's game against the Cardinals approaches. In Sunday's 26-21 win over the Saints, Jennings parlayed his 87 percent snap share into 5-89-1 line on a team-high 10 targets.
