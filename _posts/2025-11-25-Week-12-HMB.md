## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Zay Flowers (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Flowers accounted for 58 of Lamar Jackson's 153 passing yards while no teammate exceeded 30 receiving yards. The shifty wide receiver is the top option in Baltimore's passing game, but the Ravens haven't gotten much going through the air in recent weeks, as Jackson has just one passing touchdown over the past three games while throwing for fewer than 200 yards in each of those outings. Flowers has caught 58 of 77 targets for 761 yards but has only one touchdown heading into Thursday's home game against the Bengals on Thanksgiving night.
</div>

### 🟢 Derrick Henry (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Henry averaged a modest 3.0 yards per carry but powered in his eighth and ninth rushing touchdowns of the season on a pair of two-yard runs in the third quarter. He has recorded at least 20 touches in six consecutive games heading into Thursday night's home game against the league-worst Bengals run defense.
</div>

### 🟢 Josh Allen (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Allen, who was also seen shaking out his right hand after one of the eight sacks he took in Thursday's loss, should be fine moving forward. He'll have a few extra days to recover before what could be another physically grueling game against the Steelers on Sunday, Nov. 30. If Allen is dealing with any physical limitations coming out of Thursday's loss, those would be revealed when the Bills resume practicing Wednesday.
</div>

### 🟢 Noah Fant (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Fant saw his offensive snap share drop to just 27 percent versus New England, a decline in usage that coincides with the return of Mike Gesicki (four catches for 35 yards on six targets) from IR. Now back in a familiar role as the No. 2 tight end in Cincinnati, Fant can safely be dropped in the majority of fantasy formats, even if quarterback Joe Burrow (toe) manages to retake the starting lineup Thursday night versus the Ravens.
</div>

### 🟢 Amon-Ra St. Brown (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The 149 receiving yards were a season high for St. Brown, while the nine grabs tied his best effort of 2025. The fifth-year wideout capped his big afternoon with an 11-yard TD from Jared Goff in the second quarter. St. Brown is one score shy of his third straight season with double-digit touchdowns, and he'll take a 75-884-9 line on 107 targets into a Thanksgiving clash with the Packers in Week 13.
</div>

### 🟢 Jordan Love (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Love's final line underscores how little the Packers were threatened by the Vikings' J.J. McCarthy-led offense in the divisional clash. Love, who Ryan Wood of USA Today reports conceded to having taken "a couple hits" to his shoulder without serious impact, attempted well under 25 passes for the third straight game and eighth time this season overall. The veteran signal-caller also failed to throw a touchdown pass for the third time in four contests, but he figures to have to be much more aggressive in a Thanksgiving road showdown against the Lions.
</div>

### 🟢 Alec Pierce (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The 26 yards marked a new single-game low for Pierce this season after he'd posted at least 67 receiving yards in six of his last seven contests. His two targets tied TE3 Drew Ogletree for fifth on the Colts against Kansas City. Pierce will look for a rebound game in another tough draw next Sunday against a stingy Texans defense.
</div>

### 🟢 Kareem Hunt (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The 30 totes were a career high for the veteran RB, as Kansas City committed to attacking Indianapolis' run defense with DeForest Buckner (neck) on IR. The strategy worked, as Hunt became the first KC player to reach 100 rushing yards this season, and he punctuated his big performance with a two-yard TD plunge in the fourth quarter that kicked off a comeback from a 20-9 deficit -- a score that extended his TD streak to four games. Isiah Pacheco (knee) could be ready to return in Week 13, but even if he does, Hunt figures to still have a significant role in the backfield in a Thanksgiving tilt against the Cowboys.
</div>

### 🟢 Tre Tucker (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Tucker led the Raiders with 10 targets Sunday, but he failed to convert the increased opportunities into production in the box score. The blame can be primarily placed on QB Geno Smith, who airmailed an open Tucker down the field on several occasions in the disappointing loss. The 10 targets represented a new high-water mark for the speedy receiver, as his role has expanded in the three games following the departure of Jakobi Meyers at the trade deadline. There is still enough upside for Tucker in his current role to warrant flex consideration against the Chargers next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Keenan Allen (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Allen paced Los Angeles in targets, catches and receiving yards on a day when Justin Herbert was under constant duress, completing just 10 of 18 passes for 81 scoreless yards and one interception prior to being removed from the game in the fourth quarter of the blowout defeat in favor of Trey Lance. Prior to Sunday, Allen hadn't topped 50 yards receiving in a game since Week 7, and he's gone without a touchdown in four consecutive contests. With the emergence of Oronde Gadsden and Quentin Johnston's return to health, Allen has taken more of a back seat in the passing game of late. The Chargers will now head into their Week 12 bye.
</div>

### 🟢 Jordan Mason (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The majority of Mason's production came on one carry, a game-long 22-yard scamper. That also helped him to the team lead in rushing yards, and he finished the afternoon with just one fewer carry than backfield mate Aaron Jones. Mason should continue operating in a relatively robust role on the ground in a Week 13 road matchup against the Seahawks, although his minuscule participation in the passing game does cap his overall upside.
</div>

### 🟢 Jonnu Smith (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Smith had totaled just four receiving yards over his last two appearances, but he bounced back slightly in Week 12. He matched his season-high mark in yards from scrimmage but continues to split work with fellow tight ends Darnell Washington and Pat Freiermuth, which limits all of their fantasy upside.
</div>

### 🟢 Darnell Washington (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Washington had just two catches in Sunday's defeat while fellow tight ends Jonnu Smith and Pat Freiermuth each had three receptions. However, Washington led the group in receiving yards and played the most snaps of the trio, as he was on the field for 68 percent of the team's offensive snaps compared to Smith's 49 percent and Freiermuth's 47 percent. Although Washington had some factors that slightly mitigated his disappointing performance, his fantasy upside is limited since he's split work with Smith and Freiermuth for most of the season.
</div>

### 🟢 Kenneth Gainwell (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jaylen Warren was able to play despite nursing an ankle issue during the week, though he out-touched Gainwell only 18-16. Gainwell's big gain as a runner came on a fake tush push, with Connor Heyward instead spinning and handing the ball to Gainwell for a 55-yard gain -- ending just short of the goal line. As has been the case often this season, Gainwell also excelled as a receiver, pacing the team in receptions and finishing second in yards. Warren is likely to continue to serve as Pittsburgh's traditional lead back moving forward, though Gainwell has a clear role in the offense that is particularly useful in PPR formats.
</div>

### 🟢 Cam Ward (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Ward turned in one of his more complete performances as a rookie, showcasing some playmaking ability while also limiting mistakes. He completed three passes of at least 20 yards -- all to different receivers -- and also threw a one-yard touchdown pass to Chimere Dike on Tennessee's final possession. Ward supplemented that with the first rushing score of his career, and he's now topped 30 rushing yards in consecutive games after failing to do so in his first nine contests. Finally, he avoided negative plays, as this marked his first game without a fumble or interception.
</div>

### 🟢 Jacory Croskey-Merritt (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Chris Rodriguez got the start for the Commanders and wound up seeing 16 touches to Croskey-Merritt's 10 while significantly out-gaining the rookie as well. The coaching staff will get a Week 12 bye to re-evaluate the offense, but Croskey-Merritt's role seems more likely to shrink than grow, as he's gone five straight games without reaching 40 rushing yards. On the season, he's produced 498 rushing yards on 114 totes for 4.4 yards per carry, but that number has plummeted to 2.9 YPC during that five-game swoon.
