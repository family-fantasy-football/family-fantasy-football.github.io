## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Tyler Allgeier (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Allgeier logged 11 carries during the Falcons' Week 10 OT loss to the Cardinals, but he was far less involved in the running game during Sunday's loss. Bijan Robinson led the way for the Falcons with 143 yards and two rushing touchdowns on 27 touches, but Allgeier punched in a one-yard touchdown run of his own late in the second quarter to salvage his fantasy production. Allgeier is now up to seven rushing touchdowns through 10 regular-season games, which is as many as he accumulated across the 2023 and 2024 regular seasons combined. Next up for the Falcons is a Week 12 road clash against the Saints on Sunday, Nov. 23.
</div>

### 🟢 David Njoku (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Njoku took a back seat to rookie tight end Harold Fannin -- as has been the case on numerous occasions this season -- resulting in the veteran's lowest reception total this season while tying his previous low in targets. The 31-year-old Njoku failed to extend his scoring streak to three games, highlighting how touchdown-dependent of an asset he has become following Fannin's emergence. Managers relying on Njoku will hope he gets back to his scoring ways against the Raiders next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Troy Franklin (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The second-year wideout tied Courtland Sutton in receptions and targets, but it was Franklin who led the Broncos in receiving yards, including a 32-yard gain in the final minute of the fourth quarter that set up Wil Lutz for the game-winning field goal. Franklin's chemistry with Bo Nix continues to shine, and over the last five games he's delivered a 22-259-4 line on 45 targets, compared to Sutton's 18-267-1 line on 34 targets during the same period.
</div>

### 🟢 Evan Engram (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Engram has yet to hit 50 yards receiving in a game this season and is playing less than 50 percent of the offensive snaps, as Adam Trautman is coach Sean Payton's preferred blocking tight end on early downs. Through 10 games, Engram has just 32 catches for 260 yards and one touchdown on 50 targets. He's not a recommended fantasy starter at tight end down the stretch as the Broncos head into their Week 12 bye.
</div>

### 🟡 Brian Thomas Jr. (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟡 Isiah Pacheco (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 Rashee Rice (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Travis Kelce turned back the clock and was Patrick Mahomes' top option on the day, but Rice finished second on Kansas City in targets and catches, although he didn't do much with the volume. It was Rice's worst performance this season in four games since making a belated 2025 debut due to a suspension, and he'll take a 26-253-3 line on 35 targets into a Week 12 tilt against the Colts.
</div>

### 🟢 Tyler Lockett (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Lockett picked up a minor knee injury in last week's loss to the Broncos, but he was able to practice in a limited fashion and suit up for Monday Night Football. The veteran wideout finished third on the team in receiving yardage and fourth in targets while starting alongside Tre Tucker. In the two games since Jakobi Meyers was traded to the Jaguars, Lockett is averaging 4.0 receptions and 38.5 yards, numbers that could draw interest from those in deeper PPR formats. Managers operating in standard leagues can probably do better than Lockett in a brutal matchup against the Browns on Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Ladd McConkey (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> McConkey had a forgettable afternoon in a shockingly lopsided loss for the Chargers that saw Justin Herbert pulled early after throwing for only 81 yards and an interception. McConkey's yardage total was his second lowest of the season, and it snapped a five-game streak of 55-plus receiving-yard efforts. The ugly afternoon for the air attack was a clear outlier, so McConkey is a good bounce-back candidate in a Week 13 home matchup against the Raiders on Sunday, Nov. 30 following a Week 12 bye.
</div>

### 🟢 De'Von Achane (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Achane put together a signature two-way performance, repeatedly picking up meaningful yardage on the ground while recording a game-long run of a relatively modest 23 yards. The speedy third-year pro did get evaluated for a possible back injury in the fourth quarter, but he was able to return to the game and handled all three carries on the Dolphins' game-winning drive to set up Riley Patterson's 29-yard field goal. Achane now has back-to-back 100-yard efforts on the ground for the first time this season, and he's recorded at least five catches in four consecutive contests heading into a Week 13 home matchup against the Saints on Sunday, Nov. 30.
</div>

### 🟡 Darius Slayton (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 Wan'Dale Robinson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Robinson garnered more of Jameis Winston's attention in the latter's 2025 debut than any other pass catcher, but that amounted to a modest yardage total. Robinson did tie for the second-most receptions on the afternoon for New York, but he continues to be utilized in a shorter-area role more often than not, limiting his overall upside. Nevertheless, Robinson is not without downfield chops, so he's a threat to break out in any given week, especially with both Jaxson Dart (concussion) and Winston willing to be aggressive.
</div>

### 🟡 Aaron Rodgers (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Though the fracture is to Rodgers' non-throwing wrist, the injury could still present complications with ball security. For his part, Rodgers is pushing to play Week 12, but he'll likely need to wear a protective brace on the wrist and prove that he's not compromised by the injury in order to get the green light to suit up Sunday. After Rodgers was forced out of this past Sunday's win over the Bengals late in the second quarter, Mason Rudolph stepped in under center and completed 12 of 16 pass attempts for 127 yards and a touchdown. According to Missi Matthews of the Steelers' official site, head coach Mike Tomlin confirmed that Rodgers won't practice Wednesday, and the veteran quarterback is expected to remain sidelined for Thursday's session as well while Rudolph receives the first-team reps to keep himself prepared to start in Chicago in the event Rodgers isn't available. Tomlin noted that Rodgers will attempt to practice Friday before the Steelers decide on his status for Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Baker Mayfield (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Mayfield fought hard in trademark fashion all afternoon, often taking matters into his own hands when an aggressive Bills defense applied pressure. Buffalo's talented secondary did limit Mayfield to his third lowest passing yardage tally of the campaign. Mayfield connected with Sean Tucker for his one touchdown pass from 28 yards out, a play he preceded with a four-yard scoring run early in the second quarter. Mayfield and the Bucs next set their sights on a Week 12 road showdown against the Rams next Sunday night.
</div>

### 🟢 Jayden Daniels (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Out<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
