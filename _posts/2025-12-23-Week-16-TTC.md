## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Rico Dowdle (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Dowdle outpaced Chuba Hubbard by just three carries and two rushing yards, as both backs had a predictably difficult time versus the Buccaneers' typically stingy run defense. With Sunday's production, Dowdle did exceed 1,000 rushing yards for the second consecutive campaign, but he's been at 58 rushing yards or fewer in six consecutive games heading into a Week 17 home matchup against a tough Seahawks defense.
</div>

### 🟢 Bryce Young (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Young turned in a relatively efficient effort in the grindy division win, and most important, he avoided any turnovers for the third straight game. The 2023 first overall pick connected with Tetairoa McMillan (22 yards) and Ja'Tavion Sanders (six yards) for his pair of scoring passes late in the second and third quarters, respectively, and he led a late seven-play, 43-yard drive that culminated in what would turn out to be the game-winning field goal. Young and the Panthers draw a tough Week 17 assignment, however, as the Seahawks drop in for a visit next Sunday afternoon.
</div>

### 🟢 Chase Brown (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> All three of Brown's trips to the end zone came in the third quarter, making him the first player in the NFL this season with three TDs in the same period. It was the third time in 2025 that the third-year back has scored multiple touchdowns, but he's got only eight TDs in total (four rushing, four receiving) through 15 contests. Brown lines up for another juicy matchup in Week 17 against the Cardinals.
</div>

### 🟢 CeeDee Lamb (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> After three straight 100-yard performances, Lamb took a back seat to George Pickens (7-130-1 on nine targets) as the talented receiving duo continue to alternate the role of Dak Prescott's favorite target. Lamb did reach 1,000 yards on the season Sunday, the fifth straight campaign he's hit that milestone, and he'll take a 69-1,027-3 line on 106 targets through 12 games into a Week 17 tilt against the Commanders.
</div>

### 🟢 Dak Prescott (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The veteran quarterback led the Cowboys to points on their first three drives, hitting Ryan Flournoy (knee) for a TD in the first quarter and finding George Pickens for a 38-yard score in the second, but the Chargers defense shut him down the rest of the way. With Dallas already eliminated from the playoffs, Joe Milton took over at QB for the team's final two possessions, and he could sub in for Prescott more frequently over the final two weeks. Prescott will still take a strong 28:10 TD:INT on the season into a Week 17 clash with the Commanders.
</div>

### 🟢 Troy Franklin (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Franklin retained a solid role in the Denver offense despite the return of Pat Bryant from a hamstring injury, with the former tying for third on the team in targets. He produced little for much of the game, though he ended with a solid yardage total thanks to a long 48-yard grab early in the fourth quarter. Franklin has re-emerged in the Broncos' offense, recording 10 catches for 151 yards combined across the last two games. He should continue to see added opportunity if Bryant, who suffered a head injury in the game, is forced to miss Denver's Week 17 matchup Thursday.
</div>

### 🟢 RJ Harvey (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Head coach Sean Payton promised to get Jaleel McLaughlin more involved in this game, and that split came to fruition. Harvey saw only seven carries as opposed to five for McLaughlin, though Harvey still got the job done as a rusher thanks to a tough 38-yard touchdown run, during which he bounced off several defenders and then out-raced a few more to reach the end zone. The Broncos were forced into a pass-heavy offense while chasing the score, which also helped Harvey rack up a season-best 71 yards through the air. While his workload will be worth monitoring as he continues to work through a rib injury, Harvey showed explosiveness on limited touches that was previously missing from his game.
</div>

### 🟢 Brenton Strange (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Strange matched his season high with seven targets, good for third on the team. Though he was limited to a modest yardage total, Strange found the end zone from three yards away late in the second quarter to reach the end zone for the second time in five games since returning from a hip injury. Strange has been limited to work primarily in the short areas of the field, but he has a consistent role in the Jaguars' passing offense, which has excelled of late.
</div>

### 🟢 Xavier Worthy (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Even with Rashee Rice (concussion) unavailable, Worthy didn't see an increase in his target volume, although it's easy to see why -- third-string QB Chris Oladokun wound up under center for most of the game after Gardner Minshew (knee) joined Patrick Mahomes (knee) on the sidelines. Worthy has gone seven straight games without catching more than four passes and nine straight without getting into the end zone, managing just a 29-387-0 line on 48 targets over that latter stretch. With Minshew also feared to have suffered a season-ending ACL tear, the entire Kansas City passing attack will have a significantly lowered floor and ceiling heading into a Week 17 meeting with the Broncos.
</div>

### 🟡 TreVeyon Henderson (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Henderson missed the entire second half of Sunday's 28-24 win over the Ravens due to what the Patriots had been classifying as a head injury, which stemmed from a hard fall to the turf. With Vrabel now confirming that Henderson has sustained a concussion, the rookie running back will have limited time to clear the five-step protocol in advance of this Sunday's game at the Jets. If Henderson can't play in Week 17, Rhamondre Stevenson would likely move back into a lead role out of the New England backfield.
</div>

### 🟢 Stefon Diggs (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Diggs ended his recent dry spell with his fourth 100-plus yard game of the season. The veteran receiver nearly doubled his entire production (72 yards, zero TDs) from his last three contests combined with Sunday's monster output. Diggs upped his season receiving line to 76-869-3, putting him in a realistic position to record his first 1,000-yard season since he was a member of the Bills in 2023. The wideout's next opportunity to work on that achievement will come in a road tilt against the Jets next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Tyrone Tracy Jr. (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Tracy reached the 70-yard threshold on the ground for the fourth time in six games. He had 16 carries to Devin Singletary's 11 while Jaxson Dart completed only seven passes and had just two carries in a quiet game for the rookie quarterback. Tracy's poised to maintain the lead-back role in the Giants' run-heavy offense in a Week 17 road game against the Raiders.
</div>

### 🟡 Mason Taylor (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 Sean Tucker (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Tucker logged four carries and netted single-digit rushing yardage for the second straight game, but he got into the end zone for a third consecutive contest via a one-yard run with under seven minutes remaining in the third quarter. Tucker's compact 5-foot-10, 210-pound frame appears to have carved him out his current red-zone role, but he'll likely remain a TD-dependent fantasy option in a Week 17 road matchup against the Dolphins.
</div>

### 🟢 Bucky Irving (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Irving easily led the Buccaneers' ground attack in rush attempts and rushing yardage, but he had a long run of just 12 yards and didn't draw a single target for the first time all season. While Irving's rushing yardage tally did match his season high, he also saw Sean Tucker vulture another goal-line opportunity that the latter successfully converted into a touchdown. Irving will aim to exploit a vulnerable Dolphins run defense in a Week 17 road matchup next Sunday.
