## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Michael Wilson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> WR Marvin Harrison (heel) returned to the starting lineup in Week 16 and pushed Wilson back into his usual No. 2 role on offense. The former saw only three targets in his return to the field while backup TE Elijah Higgins (7-91-0) surprisingly finished as Arizona's leading receiver Sunday. Wilson -- who was averaging 15.0 targets in games Harrison has missed this year -- made the most of his reduced opportunities by scoring a touchdown in the first quarter with the assistance of replay review. The 25-year-old Wilson's three targets are a concerning sign looking forward because the wideout has struggled to find the end zone with just two TDs (including Sunday's) in games Harrison has been active for. Wilson's upside takes a huge hit for Week 17, but he is still producing enough alongside Harrison to warrant starting consideration against the Bengals next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Kirk Cousins (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Cousins was unable to replicate last week's vintage 373-yard performance, but he was able to reproduce the trio of touchdowns in another winning effort. The 36-year-old's third trip to the end zone came via a rare QB sneak in the fourth quarter that would end up serving as the game-deciding score Sunday. Cousins is beginning to show flashes of his former glory after looking rusty in his first few starts taking over for the injured Michael Penix (knee). While he is far from a sure thing, Cousins has at least put himself back in the conversation for potential starting options for fantasy managers in desperate QB situations. A Week 17 matchup against a tough Rams defensive unit dampens the excitement around the veteran starter for those in standard fantasy leagues.
</div>

### 🟡 Lamar Jackson (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jackson said "the goal" is to play Week 17 after having been forced out of Sunday night's 28-24 loss to the Patriots late in the second quarter, but his status for Saturday remains uncertain, per Jamison Hensley of ESPN.com. The franchise quarterback is slated for an MRI on Monday, though head coach John Harbaugh has provided an initial diagnosis of Jackson's back injury as "a bruise of some kind." Tyler Huntley will start versus the Packers in the event that Jackson is unable to play. The Ravens will close out the regular season on the road against the Steelers in Week 18 in what could be a must-win game for their playoff chances.
</div>

### 🟢 Quinshon Judkins (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Injured Reserve<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The team added that Judkins is expected to make a full recovery ahead of the 2026 season and will return to football activity in four-to-six months. Judkins suffered the gruesome injury in Sunday's loss to the Bills. With the rookie running back out for the final two games of the season, Cleveland is expected to roll with some combination of Dylan Sampson (hand/calf), Raheim Sanders and Trayveon Williams against the Steelers and Bengals.
</div>

### 🟢 Jameson Williams (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Williams tied for second on the team with nine targets, as there was plenty of opportunity for all of Detroit's pass catchers due to Jared Goff taking to the air 54 times. Williams was quiet for much of the game, though he logged a pair of 21-yard receptions and served as the Lions' primary deep threat as they attempted a dramatic comeback late in the fourth quarter. Williams took a slight step back relative to his recent performances, but he has at least 70 receiving yards in six of eight games while also recording five touchdowns since the team's bye in Week 8.
</div>

### 🟢 Nico Collins (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Collins finished as Houston's leading receiver on a team-high nine targets, but his production was muted by his worst catch rate (44 percent) since Week 10. The star wideout failed to take advantage of a soft matchup against the Raiders in a contest that wound up being much closer than many had anticipated. Collins had been on a three-game heater (12-304-2) prior to Sunday's pedestrian results, so fantasy managers in the thick of the playoff schedule are hoping for a bounce-back effort against the Chargers on Saturday.
</div>

### 🟢 Jonathan Taylor (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Taylor salvaged his fantasy night with a one-yard touchdown run early in the fourth quarter, which narrowed a 34-20 deficit. The star back otherwise was stonewalled on the ground for the majority of the night, although he made some solid contributions as a receiver. Taylor's rushing yardage total was his second lowest of the season, while his average of 2.9 yards per carry was a new low-water mark. He hasn't eclipsed the 100-yard mark on the ground since his memorable 244-yard performance against the Falcons in Berlin in Week 10, and he'll draw another tough matchup at home against the Jaguars in a Week 17 divisional clash Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Brock Bowers (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Geno Smith (shoulder/back) returned from a one-game absence and reignited his tight end's hot streak dating back to Week 13. The veteran signal-caller found Bowers in the end zone in the second quarter for the fourth touchdown in the duo's last three active games. The 22-year-old Bowers is well off the pace from the 1,194 receiving yards he racked up in 2024 as a rookie, but his improved nose for the end zone (seven trips) as a sophomore has helped offset the dip in volume. Bowers can be viewed as a premier tight end in fantasy for next Sunday's tilt against the Giants.
</div>

### 🟡 Kimani Vidal (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Vidal was forced from Sunday's 34-17 win over the Cowboys in the fourth quarter after he rushed five times for 11 yards on 21 offensive snaps. If Vidal is unable to play next Saturday against the Texans, Omarion Hampton would likely see a larger share of the backfield work, with Hassan Haskins spelling Hampton as the Chargers' RB2.
</div>

### 🟢 Oronde Gadsden (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> After a big four-game stretch from Weeks 6 to 9, Gadsden has crashed back to Earth in recent weeks. Over his last six games, Gadsden has compiled just 12 catches for 166 scoreless yards on 23 targets. He's devolved into an untrustworthy option at fantasy's weakest position ahead of next Saturday's date with a stingy Houston defense.
</div>

### 🟢 Jaylen Waddle (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Waddle flashed good chemistry with rookie first-time starter Quinn Ewers, leading the Dolphins in receptions, receiving yards and targets. The swapping out of Tua Tagovailoa for Ewers thus seemed to give Waddle's outlook a boost, as the talented wideout posted his best receiving yardage total in the last five contests. Waddle should have the opportunity to continue working with Ewers in a Week 17 home matchup against the Buccaneers next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Jordan Addison (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Addison couldn't hold onto what would have been a 25-yard touchdown catch in the first quarter. He finished a distant second on the team in receiving yards behind Justin Jefferson (85). Minnesota's passing game will be tough to trust Thursday against the Lions, especially if rookie Max Brosmer is thrust into his second NFL start. Brosmer entered after J.J. McCarthy (hand) left Sunday's win in the second quarter.
</div>

### 🟢 Devin Neal (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Injured Reserve<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Neal's rookie season thus is over with the Saints not eligible for a postseason berth after he sustained a hamstring injury this past Sunday against the Panthers. In 10 appearances (three starts) on the campaign, he totaled 57 carries for 206 yards and two touchdowns, hauled in 17 of 19 passes for 104 yards and didn't fumble. With Alvin Kamara (knee/ankle) currently unable to practice and in danger of missing more time, New Orleans appears poised to roll with Audric Estime and Evan Hull at running back for the time being.
</div>

### 🔴 Garrett Wilson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Injured Reserve<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> With the Jets 3-11 and out of playoff contention, there was no need to rush Wilson -- who last played in Week 10 -- back into action. The team's star wideout thus finishes his 2025 campaign with 36 catches (on 59 targets) for 395 yards and four TDs in seven games. Per Glenn, the Jets "just wanted to be smart with (Wilson) because he's a key cog of what we're doing here." The 2022 first-rounder remains under contract with New York through the 2030 campaign, and looking ahead he'll have plenty of time to recover from his knee issue ahead of next season, and when he next takes the field his supporting cast will no doubt be different, with upgrades at QB and WR presumably offseason priorities for the Jets.
</div>

### 🟢 Jaylen Warren (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The backfield split in Pittsburgh remained consistent, with Warren taking the lead on the ground and Kenneth Gainwell working as the preferred pass catcher. Warren came alive in the second half, ripping off nearly identical 45-yard touchdown runs on back-to-back possessions in the fourth quarter while also chipping in an additional 21-yard gain. The end result was a career-high 143 yards on the ground and Warren's first time cracking the century mark since Week 7. It was a needed showing, as he had also been held below 40 rushing yards in three straight games entering Sunday's matchup.
</div>

### 🟢 Tyjae Spears (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Tony Pollard led the way in the Titans backfield with 21 carries and a third straight 100-yard game, but Spears made an impact as well as as he handled a season high in carries and touches while reaching 100 scrimmage yards for the first time in 2025 and scoring his first TD since Week 8. With the Titans' offense finally looking at least competent, Spears and Pollard could remain in something close to a timeshare over the final two weeks of the season, including for a Week 17 tilt against the Saints.
