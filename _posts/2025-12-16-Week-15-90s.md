## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Michael Wilson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Once again, Wilson was one of Jacoby Brissett's favorite downfield options in a blowout loss. Marvin Harrison has missed four of the last five games due to appendicitis and a heel injury, and in all four of those contests Wilson has seen double-digit targets, posting a massive 41-499-3 line on 60 targets during Harrison's absences. Harrison is expected to return before the end of the year, but if he's out again in Week 16 versus the Falcons, Wilson will be a must-start fantasy asset.
</div>

### 🟢 Kirk Cousins (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Cousins' what-year-is-this performance was worthy of a double take, considering the veteran signal-caller had looked like he'd regressed considerably in his previous four starts and two in-game cameos prior to Thursday night. He had embarrassed the Buccaneers secondary last season in an unforgettable 509-yard, four-touchdown TNF performance as well, and this latest prolific effort went largely through tight end Kyle Pitts, who was on the receiving end of 11 of Cousins' completions totaling 166 yards and also recorded all three receiving touchdowns on the night. Cousins' performance was all the more noteworthy considering the absence of Drake London (knee), and it certainly brightens the outlook for the Falcons' air attack heading into a Week 16 road matchup against the Cardinals on Sunday, Dec. 21 that the talented wideout should have a good chance of being ready for.
</div>

### 🟢 Lamar Jackson (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> With the Ravens' defense putting together a dominant effort, Jackson didn't need to do too much more after finding Rasheen Ali and Zay Flowers for TDs in the second quarter. It's the first time Jackson has tossed multiple touchdowns since Week 9, as he'd stumbled to a 2:4 TD:INT over his prior five games, but a matchup against Cincinnati's woeful defense wasn't exactly a tough test. The two-time MVP will need to stay sharp in Week 16 against the Patriots if the Ravens are going to stay in the AFC playoff picture.
</div>

### 🟢 Quinshon Judkins (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Despite the muted number of rushing attempts, Judkins continued to lead the Browns' backfield. However, he found running room scarce, with his longest gain of the day going for only four yards. Judkins has now been held below 50 rushing yards in three of his last four games, all of which have been with Shedeur Sanders under center.
</div>

### 🟢 Jameson Williams (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Williams continued his recent string of WR1 performances by nearly matching the season-best line of 7-144-1 he produced against the Packers in Week 13. The Alabama product is averaging 95.3 yards per game since Detroit's Week 8 bye, and that includes a zero-catch dud against the Giants. Amon-Ra St. Brown (13-164-2) also feasted against the Rams' secondary, proving that this passing attack can generate two fantasy stars simultaneously. Williams needs just 64 receiving yards against the Steelers next Sunday in order to reach the 1,000-yard plateau in consecutive seasons.
</div>

### 🟢 Nico Collins (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Texans' top wideout turned C.J. Stroud's first pass of the day into a 57-yard touchdown, setting the tone for the rout, and Collins then scored Houston's last TD with a four-yard grab in the fourth quarter. It was his first multi-score performance of the season, but he's been locked in since missing a Week 8 clash with the Niners due to a concussion. Over the last seven games, Collins has racked up a 38-662-3 line on 61 targets while also adding a score on the ground. Collins will look to keep rolling in Week 16 against the Raiders.
</div>

### 🟢 Jonathan Taylor (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Since 44-year-old Philip Rivers wasn't able to be a downfield threat in his first start since 2021, he wasn't able to take the pressure off Taylor and Indianapolis' ground game Sunday. Once the Seahawks realized this, the defense was consistently stacking the box against the Colts' top weapon on offense, resulting in a pedestrian mark of 3.5 yards per carry. Taylor suffered a similar fate against Jacksonville in Week 14 after Daniel Jones (Achilles) left the contest, so it may be tough sledding for the superstar running back going forward without the threat of a deep passing attack. The 26-year-old Taylor will receive a heavy workload to help offset the recent drop in efficiency, and a soft matchup against the 49ers' defense next Monday boosts his prospects for Week 16.
</div>

### 🟢 Brock Bowers (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Bowers led the Raiders in receptions, targets and even receiving yards on an afternoon during which Kenny Pickett netted just 64 yards on his 15 completions. The talented tight end's production has been capped to an extent this season due to Las Vegas' suboptimal quarterback situation, but Bowers will still head into a tough Week 16 road matchup against the Texans next Sunday afternoon with at least four receptions in five consecutive games.
</div>

### 🟢 Oronde Gadsden II (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Gadsden led the Chargers in receiving yards and tied for second in targets, also providing the team's second-longest catch of the afternoon (27 yards). Quentin Johnston's absence due to a groin injury may have benefitted the rookie tight end, who finished with his highest reception and receiving yardage totals since Week 9. Gadsden will take a 43-602-2 line on 60 targets into a Week 16 road matchup against the Cowboys.
</div>

### 🟢 Kimani Vidal (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Vidal logged three fewer rush attempts than backfield mate Omarion Hampton and was a lot less efficient, averaging 2.8 yards per carry to his teammate's 4.1. Vidal did at least extend his streak of consecutive games with double-digit carries to three contests, and he figures to continue enjoying a relatively robust complementary role in a Week 16 road matchup against the Cowboys next Sunday afternoon.
</div>

### 🟢 Jaylen Waddle (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Although Tua Tagovailoa had his most productive passing effort since Week 9, Waddle was only a bit player in his quarterback's production. The talented wideout finished with his lowest reception, receiving yardage and target totals since Week 7, a particularly untimely downturn for fantasy managers rolling with him in their playoff games. Waddle should have a good opportunity to bounce back Week 16, as the Bengals pay a visit to South Florida on Sunday afternoon.
</div>

### 🟢 Tua Tagovailoa (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Tagovailoa's final line was certainly useful from a fantasy perspective, considering his passing yardage total was his fourth highest of the season and his multi-touchdown tally was his first in the last four games. He connected with Darren Waller for both of his scoring tosses (six and 13 yards), although both came in the fourth quarter with the game essentially out of reach. Tagovailoa had failed to reach the 200-yard mark through the air in four straight games before Monday, but he could once again compile some fantasy-friendly numbers in a Week 16 home matchup against the Bengals on Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Jordan Addison (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Addison made his mark on Sunday Night Football when he took a deep pass from QB J.J. McCarthy 58 yards down the field in the second quarter of the win over Dallas. This was a great sign for fantasy managers after the wideout was dealing with a minor Achilles injury during the practice week. The 66 yards marked Addison's highest receiving total since Week 7, highlighting a potential return to form as McCarthy's play improves down the stretch. A soft matchup against the Giants' secondary next Sunday should help Addison generate value as a flex option in Week 16.
</div>

### 🟡 Devin Neal (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Saints already have been without top RB Alvin Kamara (knee/ankle) for what is now three straight contests, and Neal, his fill-in during that span, has been ruled out for the rest of Week 15. Neal thus will finish Sunday with seven carries for 28 yards and one touchdown and one catch (on one target) for four yards. Evan Hull and Audric Estime will be New Orleans' backfield options in the absences of Kamara and Neal.
</div>

### 🔴 Garrett Wilson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Injured Reserve<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Wilson has been on injured reserve since aggravating a knee injury in Week 10 against the Browns. He is eligible to have his practice window opened at any point moving forward, but it's unclear when or if that will occur. Glenn's answer to the media Wednesday regarding Wilson's status didn't differ from the information Glenn offered Monday. At this point, the Jets are preparing to move forward with John Metchie and Adonai Mitchell as their top two wide receivers for Sunday's game against the Jaguars.
</div>

### 🟢 Jaylen Warren (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Warren was a late addition to Monday's injury report with an illness, which may help explain his poor individual performance in his team's victory. Backup Kenneth Gainwell took advantage of the starter's limitations and finished as Pittsburgh's leading rusher on a team-high 20 touches. It was only the third time this season that Warren's backup reached double-digit carries, so fantasy managers shouldn't hit the panic button following Monday's backfield shift. A healthier Warren will have an opportunity to reestablish himself as the Steelers' primary back in a road matchup against the Lions on Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Tyjae Spears (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Spears was on the field for only 20 offensive snaps, his lowest mark since Week 5 -- his season debut. His longest gain went for 20 yards and came during garbage time in the blowout loss. Spears has been a peripheral option in the Tennessee backfield, and the Titans have shown no signs of shifting work away from Tony Pollard.
