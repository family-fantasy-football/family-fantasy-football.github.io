## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Marvin Harrison Jr. (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Harrison matched his previous career mark of 12 targets set in Week 13 last season (5-60-1), but he was less efficient this time around with just three receptions to show. The Ohio State product still cashed in his fourth touchdown reception on the year, bumping his season receiving line up to 34-525-4 through nine starts. Look for QB Jacoby Brissett to continue feeding the rock to Harrison in a favorable matchup against the 49ers next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Jacoby Brissett (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Brissett's improbable victory over the Cowboys last week was put out of mind after Arizona was greeted by the Seahawks with a 35-0 deficit in the first half. The veteran signal-caller salvaged his day by compiling stats in garbage time, producing his fourth straight start of 250 or more passing yards and two touchdowns thrown. Brissett has great shot at extending his streak of fantasy production against an injury-riddled 49ers defense next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟡 Dalton Kincaid (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Kincaid secured two of three targets for 37 yards before being forced out of Sunday's divisional loss in the third quarter. He appears to be dealing with an injury severe enough to keep him sidelined Week 11 versus the Buccaneers and potentially longer, though the Bills haven't yet provided an estimated timetable for third-year pro's recovery. Kincaid has emerged as one of Josh Allen's clear top targets in the passing game alongside wide receiver Khalil Shakir, and any missed games on his part will thrust Dawson Knox and Jackson Hawes into expanded roles at tight end.
</div>

### 🟢 James Cook III (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Cook was involved as a receiver at his highest clip since Week 1, as the Bills were already down 16-0 at halftime and therefore were in catch-up mode throughout the second half. The talented back did run hard with his limited opportunities on the ground, but he finished tied for a season low in carries and also lost a fumble in Dolphins territory early in the second quarter that helped lead to a Miami field goal. The downturn was drastic after Cook had rushed for 330 yards and two touchdowns over the previous two games, but he'll look to bounce back in Week 11 at home against a typically stingy Buccaneers run defense that showed some cracks against the Patriots' TreVeyon Henderson on Sunday.
</div>

### 🟡 J.K. Dobbins (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Dobbins left the field after an apparent hip-drop tackle at the end of a two-yard run in the middle of the third quarter and missed the next three drives before returning late in the fourth quarter to help seal the victory with six more carries to run out the clock. Overall, he had 18 rushes for 77 yards and caught his only target for seven yards, while No. 2 RB RJ Harvey combined for six touches for 18 total yards. The Broncos don't play again until Sunday, Nov. 16 versus the Chiefs, so a diagnosis and potential prognosis should be known well before that point.
</div>

### 🟢 Jared Goff (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Goff topped 300 yards for the second time this season thanks to a particularly efficient performance. In addition to completing more than 75 percent of his passes, Goff tallied three gains of more than 20 yards while throwing for a pair of 14-yard touchdowns and one of nine. Goff now has multiple passing scores in six of his nine games on the campaign, and he's averaged more than 7.5 yards per attempt in three straight matchups.
</div>

### 🟡 Romeo Doubs (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Doubs was holding his chest following a Packers possession in the fourth quarter and was later spotted walking into the locker room. The severity of the injury is unclear, but Green Bay continues to lose pass-catching options. Christian Watson and Dontayvion Wicks will operate as the team's top receivers so long as Doubs is held out.
</div>

### 🟢 Tyler Warren (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The rookie tight end finished as the Colts' leader in receptions, receiving yards and targets in the overseas clash, and all three totals also served as new career highs for Warren. The Penn State product has been as good as expected over his first nine games, and he'll head into the Week 11 bye with a robust 50-617-3 receiving line on 67 targets after serving as one of Daniel Jones' primary security blankets during the latter's resurgent first half of the season.
</div>

### 🟢 Ashton Jeanty (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jeanty was essentially the lone bright spot for the Raiders' offense, and he put the team's only touchdown of the night on the board with a four-yard run late in the first quarter. Jeanty generally found tough sledding on the ground against a talented Broncos defense, and in Las Vegas' first game without the traded Jakobi Meyers, the rookie first-round pick logged his second straight five-target tally. Jeanty draws a much more palatable matchup next time out, as the Raiders welcome in a beatable Cowboys defense on Monday night, Nov. 17.
</div>

### 🟢 Omarion Hampton (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Injured Reserve<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Hampton won't be listed as a participant in practice, but his ability to work in any capacity is an encouraging step in the right direction as the rookie running back recovers from an ankle injury that landed him on injured reserve. Hampton has already spent the requisite four weeks on IR, but coach Jim Harbaugh said earlier in the week that Hampton isn't expected to return until after the Chargers' Week 12 bye.
</div>

### 🟡 Kayshon Boutte (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Boutte didn't practice during Week 10 prep due to a hamstring injury and then was inactive this past Sunday at Tampa Bay. His listed activity level Monday thus is a positive sign ahead of Thursday's game against the Jets, but he'll have two more chances to prove the health of his hamstring before then.
</div>

### 🟡 Jaxson Dart (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Dart took a big hit at the end of a seven-yard quarterback keeper and was wobbly as he went to the sideline and eventually the locker room. With a concussion confirmed, he'll be subject to the protocol for head injuries to be able to suit up again. He'll finish Week 10 action with 241 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions on 19-of-29 passing, six carries for 66 yards and two TDs and a lost fumble. Russell Wilson will direct the Giants offense for as long as Dart is sidelined.
</div>

### 🟢 AJ Barner (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Seahawks threw the ball just 12 times, as they scored 38 points in the first half and benefited from two defensive touchdowns. Thus, Barner failed to secure a target for the first time this season while handling just 23 offensive snaps. He should return to his typical pass-catching role in Week 11 versus the Rams.
</div>

### 🟢 Chimere Dike (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Dike had been breaking out as a receiver in recent weeks, but he showcased his overall playmaking ability in Sunday's loss. He returned a punt 67 yards for a touchdown late in the first quarter, bouncing off a few tacklers before streaking down the right sideline into the end zone. Dike otherwise took a disappointing step back as a pass catcher, as this marked his first game without multiple catches since Week 4.
</div>

### 🟡 Chris Rodriguez Jr. (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Rodriguez jogged to the locker room in the second half and eventually was termed questionable to return. If he stays off the field, he'll end Week 10 action with six carries for 16 yards and one touchdown while getting no targets in the passing game. Jacory Croskey-Merritt and Jeremy McNichols are the healthy and available running backs on the Commanders' active roster.
