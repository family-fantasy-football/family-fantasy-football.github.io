## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Khalil Shakir (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Shakir helped break the game open with a nifty 54-yard catch-and-run touchdown to cap off the opening drive of the second half, extending a 19-3 halftime lead. Shakir's catch total tied a season-best figure, while his yardage tally served as a new high-water mark for him on the campaign. Shakir has at least five receptions in three of his past four games heading into a Week 9 home showdown against the Chiefs.
</div>

### 🟢 Harold Fannin Jr. (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The rookie led the Browns in receptions, targets and yards while hauling in a 18-yard TD from Dillon Gabriel in the first quarter. Fannin and fellow tight end David Njoku have emerged as the most reliable downfield options for Gabriel, as wide receivers accounted for just three of his 21 completions on the afternoon. Fannin will take a 38-352-2 line on 51 targets through eight games into a Week 9 bye before facing the Jets in Week 10.
</div>

### 🟢 Jake Ferguson (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Ferguson has been one of the league's most productive tight ends in 2025, but he laid an egg against a tough Denver defense. He came into Sunday's loss riding a four-game, six-touchdown streak, and Ferguson had previously fallen short of five catches only once all season. Dallas' entire passing offense struggled, as Dak Prescott failed to throw a touchdown pass. Ferguson and his teammates will likely put forth a better performance at home against the Cardinals in Week 9.
</div>

### 🟢 George Pickens (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Pickens delivered a nearly identical stat line to CeeDee Lamb, as the former had one fewer target but four more yards. After a five-game, six-touchdown streak, Pickens has now gone consecutive games without scoring. He'll try to end that drought in a Week 9 home game against the Cardinals while continuing to work as a key cog in a high-powered Dallas offense.
</div>

### 🟢 Woody Marks (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Marks led the Texans in rushing yards despite logging six fewer carries than backfield mate Nick Chubb, and he also made his mark as a pass catcher with a game-long 50-yard reception. Marks' 5.6 yards per carry served as a new career high, and he's now been afforded double-digit carries in three of the last four games while generating an 11-119-1 receiving line in the same span. The ascending rookie next sets his sights on a Week 9 home matchup against a tough Broncos defense.
</div>

### 🟢 Michael Pittman Jr. (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Pittman finished Sunday's decisive victory leading his club across the board in targets, receptions and receiving yards. The Colts' top wideout also cashed in his sixth touchdown of the season, matching his previous career high from 2021 in nine fewer games. Pittman will carry a healthy 43-446-6 receiving line into next Sunday's road tilt against the Steelers.
</div>

### 🟢 Daniel Jones (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> It still feels surreal to say in 2025 that Jones entered a matchup that he should dominate easily, but that's exactly what he did in another impressive showing for the 7-1 Colts. It was the 28-year-old's first game tossing three touchdown passes with his new club. Part of Jones' breakout with Indianapolis has been his ability to correct the turnover woes we saw earlier in his career, resulting in a career-best 4.3 TD/INT rate. Jones should continue being a match made in heaven for both the Colts and fantasy managers in a road tilt against the Steelers next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Bhayshul Tuten (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The five carries are pretty standard for Tuten, though it's more notable in this contest given that starter Travis Etienne carried just eight times. That likely had more to do with a lopsided game script than anything else, but it's still worth noting with Tuten positioned as Jacksonville's No. 2 tailback. The rookie fourth-round pick enters the bye week with 27 carries for 108 yards, six receptions for 59 yards and two total touchdowns in seven games.
</div>

### 🟢 Tre' Harris (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Harris actually led all Chargers wide receivers with a 59 percent snap share, as the rookie second-round pick's role in the offense is slowly expanding. His first NFL touchdown came on a six-yard reception in the fourth quarter. Harris will look to build on this performance Week 9 against the Titans.
</div>

### 🟢 Davante Adams (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Adams had an efficient day at the office Sunday, converting over half of his receptions into touchdowns for the fans in London. The veteran superstar took full advantage of Puka Nacua's (ankle) absence, matching the three touchdowns Adams posted over his first six starts with Los Angeles in one fell swoop. The 32-year-old Adams has provided fantasy managers with a 31-431-6 receiving line in what is shaping up to be a renaissance season in 2025. With the Rams entering a bye in Week 8, there is a realistic possibility that Nacua returns from a low-ankle sprain against the Saints in Week 9. If that's the case, Adams' run as the Rams' WR1 will have lasted just one week, but he is still a must-start asset in fantasy even as the team's No. 2 option.
</div>

### 🟢 T.J. Hockenson (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Minnesota's offense struggled against the Chargers as Carson Wentz was sacked five times amid an injury-depleted offensive line. There were few opportunities for Hockenson as a result. He did go out on a route on 30 of his 40 snaps on offense, so he was involved in the passing game when the team fell far behind.
</div>

### 🟢 Drake Maye (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The pick was his first turnover since Week 3, but otherwise it was another impressive performance from the second-year QB. Maye's 282 passing yards were his highest total since the Patriots' season opener, and he's fired multiple TD passes in six of eight games this season, leaving him with a 15:3 TD:INT. Maye will face a potentially tough test in Week 9 against a Falcons defense that had been stingy to begin the year, but that just gave up four passing TDs to Tua Tagovailoa.
</div>

### 🟢 Alvin Kamara (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> With Kendre Miller (knee) being placed on injured reserve this week, Kamara finished Sunday's contest as the only Saints RB to record a carry. However, that did not lead to a fruitful fantasy day after New Orleans abandoned the run early, passing 51 times compared to 15 rush attempts in the one-sided loss. Kamara's lack of involvement in the passing game has been concerning through eight weeks, as he is currently on pace to finish with a career-worst 306 receiving yards. Starting QB Spencer Rattler was benched in the second half of Sunday's loss, so a potential change under center could help unlock Kamara as a receiver against the Rams in Week 9.
</div>

### 🟡 Ricky Pearsall (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
