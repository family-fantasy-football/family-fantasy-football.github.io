## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Trey McBride (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> McBride was held in check -- by his own lofty standards -- in a matchup against a tough defense Sunday. The 25-year-old still finished with decent receiving numbers and extended his streak of catching at least five passes in every game this season. McBride continues to operate as one of the top fantasy tight ends in football, producing a 93-937-8 receiving line through 13 starts. The Texans present another tough matchup on paper next Sunday, but McBride's talent overrides any potential downgrade for Week 15.
</div>

### 🟢 Chuba Hubbard (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The fifth-year running back topped 100 scrimmage yards for the first time all season and got into the end zone for the first time since Week 8. He turned a screen pass into a 35-yard TD in the first quarter for Carolina's first points of the afternoon. Hubbard's touch volume also tied his season high, and with Rico Dowdle (58 rushing yards on 18 carries) struggling to make an impact in recent weeks, the workload split in the Panthers backfield may be tipping back in Hubbard's favor. The team will be on bye next week, so clarity in the pecking order likely won't come until a Week 15 clash with the Saints.
</div>

### 🟢 Kyle Monangai (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Monangai worked as the traditional lead back for Chicago during the first half, though his touches ultimately evened out with D'Andre Swift throughout the final two quarters. Monangai couldn't find much running room in the tough matchup, logging a long gain of only nine yards while averaging 4.1 yards per carry. While it wasn't his best showing, Monangai has clearly established a major role in the Chicago offense, having logged at least 12 carries in four consecutive contests.
</div>

### 🟢 Ja'Marr Chase (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Chase took a back seat to the returning Tee Higgins on the afternoon, with the Bills' attention on the former paying off nicely for the latter. Chase's receiving yardage total was his second sub-50-yard tally in the last three games, but the elite wideout hasn't seen fewer than eight targets since Week 3. Chase will aim to bounce back in a Week 15 home rematch with a Ravens team he posted a 7-110-0 line against in a Thanksgiving Night win.
</div>

### 🟢 Joe Burrow (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Burrow was victimized by a pair of line-of-scrimmage interceptions on back-to-back plays in the fourth quarter, which ultimately turned the tide of the game. The Bills' Christian Benford made a stellar leaping grab of an attempted screen pass on the first pick, while A.J. Epenesa got ahold of a deflected throw in the second instance. Otherwise, Burrow's second game back after a long layoff saw the 2020 first-round pick thrive despite snowy conditions, connecting on a season-high four touchdown passes to Tee Higgins (21, 25 yards), Chase Brown (10 yards ) and Mike Gesicki (12 yards). Burrow will next face off with the same Ravens squad he upended in his Thanksgiving Night return when Baltimore pays a visit for a Week 15 matchup next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 David Montgomery (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Montgomery logged his fourth consecutive single-digit carry tally, but he produced his best yardage total over that span by far with a big hand from his impressive 35-yard touchdown run up the middle in the latter portion of the second quarter. The veteran back crossed the 600-yard mark on the ground for the season as well with Thursday's production, and he's recorded a rushing score in consecutive games heading into a Week 15 road matchup against the Rams on Sunday, Dec. 14.
</div>

### 🟢 Christian Watson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Watson made the most of his limited opportunities after cashing in a pair of 20-plus yard touchdown receptions against the Bears. The 26-year-old finished as the game's leading receiver despite tying two teammates for the team lead in targets (four). Watson has hit the ground running since being activated off injured reserve back in Week 8. The 2022 second-round pick has provided fantasy managers with a 25-452-5 receiving line over that seven-game span. Watson is thriving as Green Bay's deep threat, almost forcing fantasy managers to start him in a tough matchup on the road against the Broncos next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Dalton Schultz (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Schultz maintained a significant role in the Houston offense, finishing third on the team in targets behind Nico Collins and Jayden Higgins. Collins was the only Texans pass catcher to reach at least 35 receiving yards, and Schultz was among those to post a muted stat line. He entered the game having topped 50 receiving yards in six of his last eight games, so he should return to better production in Week 15 against Arizona.
</div>

### 🟢 Josh Downs (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Downs' four catches were his most since Week 9 against the Steelers, and he finished third in both catches and receiving yards behind Alec Pierce (five catches for 80 yards) and Michael Pittman (nine catches for 79 yards). Downs has just eight receptions (on 17 targets) over his last three games, and his fantasy floor figures to be lower for the rest of the season after Daniel Jones tore his right Achilles during the first quarter of Sunday's loss. With Anthony Richardson (eye) on injured reserve and no timeline for a return, the Colts will turn to rookie sixth-rounder Riley Leonard for the home stretch of the 2025 regular season, starting with a Week 15 road clash against the Seahawks on Sunday, Dec. 14.
</div>

### 🟢 Travis Etienne Jr. (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> While he was helped by a brief Bhayshul Tuten absence, Etienne dominated the work out of Jacksonville's backfield and topped 20 carries for only the second time this season. He was very efficient with his work in the first half, scoring twice from three and 28 yards away while also turning in an additional long run of 11 yards. Etienne lost much of that efficiency in the second half as Jacksonville was running out the clock, but he still managed to top 70 rushing yards for the fourth time in his last six games.
</div>

### 🟢 Matthew Stafford (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Stafford wasted no time getting back to his MVP-bid form after uncharacteristically committing three turnovers in last week's surprising loss to Carolina. The 37-year-old extended his streak of throwing multiple touchdown passes to seven games while making an example of Arizona's secondary. With 35 touchdowns thrown through 13 weeks, Stafford has nearly built a double-digit margin between himself and Dak Prescott/Jared Goff (26) for the league lead in the category. The fantasy star is already producing at a high level as the playoff schedule approaches, but Stafford may find added motivation playing against the club that drafted him in 2009 when the Rams host the Lions next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Rhamondre Stevenson (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Stevenson saw one more carry than TreVeyon Henderson in the run-heavy game plan, but he finished with 27 fewer yards. However, Stevenson was the more effective receiver of the two thanks to his co-game-high 36-yard reception, which helped the veteran to his second-highest receiving yardage total of the campaign. Stevenson doubled his Week 12 workload on the ground, but Henderson likely remains the No. 1 option heading into a Week 15 home clash on Sunday, Dec. 14 against the Bills following a Week 14 bye.
</div>

### 🟢 A.J. Brown (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Brown paced the Eagles in targets and receiving production on Monday Night Football while posting his third 100-yard game in a row. The normally sure-handed receiver did leave some fantasy points on the table after committing drops on passes that hit him in the hands. One occurred on a beautifully-placed ball in the end zone, while a later drop directly resulted in one of QB Jalen Hurts' four interceptions in the overtime loss. After falling out of favor at times earlier in the schedule, Brown has garnered double-digit targets in four consecutive contests. The once disgruntled superstar is rounding into form just in time for the fantasy playoffs with a soft matchup against the Raiders on tap for Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Cooper Kupp (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> For the first time since Rashid Shaheed joined Seattle, the former Saint had a big role on offense, posting a 4-67-0 line on five targets. With Jaxon Smith-Njigba (7-92-2 on 10 targets) also putting up his usual substantial production, that left just three targets for Kupp. The good news for the veteran wideout's fantasy managers is that one of his two catches went for an 11-yard TD early in the fourth quarter. With that being said, Kupp has now caught three or fewer passes in seven straight games, and with Shaheed potentially trending up in terms of his involvement as a target for Sam Darnold, Kupp figures to remain a risky fantasy play.
</div>

### 🟢 Jaxon Smith-Njigba (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> After not being needed in last week's rout of the Vikings, Smith-Njigba was a bigger part of the game plan this time around, hauling in a 28-yard TD from Sam Darnold in the third quarter and a four-yard score in the fourth as the Seahawks pulled away in the second half. JSN has fallen off his 2,000-yard pace over the last couple weeks, but he still leads the NFL by a wide margin with 1,428 yards through 13 games, to go along with 89 catches and nine touchdowns. The third-year wideout will look for another big performance in Week 15 against the Colts.
</div>

### 🟢 Sam Darnold (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The two teams traded field goals in the first half before Darnold got going after halftime, as he tossed a 28-yard TD to Jaxon Smith-Njigba in the third quarter before connecting with Cooper Kupp and JSN on red-zone scores in the fourth. Darnold now has a 22:11 TD:INT through 13 games this season, including three games with three-plus touchdowns, and he'll look to keep the Seahawks on track for the playoffs in a Week 15 home clash against the Colts.
