## Player Report

#### Bryce Young (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Young and his first-unit teammates played only two series, and as his final line indicates, the 2023 first overall pick couldn't get on the board as a passer. He targeted Ja'Tavion Sanders and rookie sensation Tetairoa McMillan with his two throws, with the former unable to find the handle on his opportunity despite the ball hitting his hands. He also saw his first pass intercepted by Derek Stingley and returned 31 yards into Panthers territory, but the play was nullified by a defensive holding penalty. While it was an underwhelming cameo for Young to say the least, expectations remain high for him in Year 2 in Dave Canales' offense, and he also was sharp during joint practices against Houston earlier in the week. Young's preseason now is complete, as David Newton of ESPN.com reports Canales already has ruled out playing starters in Thursday night's home preseason finale against the Steelers.
#### Chase Brown (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Brown played the opening drive and accounted for all five of Cincinnati's RB touches on the series, after getting all eight touches across two drives in the previous preseason game. His final carry was a one-yard TD plunge on fourth down, with Samaje Perine then taking over on the next drive. Perine may have a role on clear passing situations, but it looks like Brown will open the regular season handling most of Cincinnati's backfield snaps and a huge share of the carries. If it doesn't work out, the Bengals have Perine and rookie sixth-round pick Tahj Brooks as favorites for the second and third spots on the depth chart. They'll open the regular season with a road game against the Browns at 1:00 p.m. ET on Sunday, Sept. 7.
#### Jerry Jeudy (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Jeudy also sat out the team's preseason opener, so his last chance to log exhibition snaps will occur Aug. 23 against the Rams. As the coming season approaches, Jeudy remains entrenched as the No. 1 option in a Cleveland wideout corps that also includes Cedric Tillman, Jamari Thrash and Diontae Johnson.
#### Trevor Lawrence (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** As the team's regular-season opener approaches, the Jaguars will focus on keeping Lawrence -- who was limited to 10 games last season -- healthy and ready to face Carolina. As long as he can avoid injuries, Lawrence is bounce-back candidate this year while working with Coen, who's coming off a successful season as Tampa's Bay's offensive coordinator. In addition to ascending second-year wideout Brian Thomas, Travis Hunter, the No. 2 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, provides Lawrence with another intriguing playmaker in a pass-catching corps that also includes WRs Dyami Brown and Parker Washington and TE Brenton Strange.
#### Brenton Strange (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Strange played one offensive possession with the Jaguars' starting skill-position unit and hauled in his only target over the middle of the field. The offseason departure of Evan Engram leaves Strange as the clear top tight end on the depth chart, though it may be hard for him to be a consistent fantasy contributor due to target competition from the likes of Brian Thomas and Travis Hunter.
#### Xavier Worthy (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Worthy logged his first reception of the preseason after seeing the field briefly with the rest of the starters last week against the Seahawks. The gadget receiver avoided the league's concussion protocol after going down hard in practice earlier in camp. Worthy could see an expanded role on offense this season with fellow wideout Rashee Rice expected to miss a significant chunk of the season due to an impending league suspension, Tom Pelissero of the NFL Network reports. The latter may be active for the first four games of the season until a ruling is made, but expect Worthy to operate as the team's top receiver for a good portion of the fantasy campaign.
#### Patrick Mahomes (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Mahomes ramped up his preseason workload after logging just three snaps on offense over the Chiefs' previous two exhibition games. The superstar QB looked to be in mid-season form while orchestrating two lengthy scoring drives (15 total plays) in one quarter of action. Mahomes threw for a career-low 3,928 yards while tying his previous worst of 26 touchdowns across 16 contests in 2024. The 29-year-old will be poised to improve on those totals this upcoming year with fellow All-Pro Travis Kelce and an improving group of young talent around him.
#### Stefon Diggs (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Though Diggs didn't suit up for any preseason games, he doesn't appear to have hit any snags in his recovery from the torn ACL he sustained Oct. 27, 2024 while playing with the Texans. After signing with New England in March, the veteran wideout avoided placement on the PUP list ahead of training camp and didn't experience any apparent restrictions in practices. The Patriots' first injury report Wednesday will clarify whether Diggs was a full participant in practice. If he opens the week without limitations, he should be ready to serve as New England's No. 1 receiver Sunday.
#### Cam Skattebo (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Making his preseason debut after a hamstring injury cost him a few weeks, Skattebo got the start on a night when Tyrone Tracy and Devin Singletary were among the many players rested. Skattebo played the first two drives and gained four yards on each of his three carries before calling it a night. Tracy appears to be the starter for Week 1 against Washington, with both Skattebo and Singletary candidates for roles off the bench. All the missed time during training camp and the preseason killed any chance Skattebo might've had to push Tracy for the lead role Week 1.
#### Braelon Allen (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Allen split the backfield work with No. 1 RB Breece Hall during the Jets' first two drives, and the former ended up outgaining his position mate by eight yards on the same number of rushes. Through two exhibitions, Allen has 15 carries for 67 yards, which amounts to 4.5 YPC (or nearly 1.0 yard more than the 3.6 he averaged as a rookie last season). The sample size is small, but it appears as if Allen will be in the mix for touches early and often alongside Hall in 2025.
#### Brandon Aiyuk (WR)
**Injury Status:** Out <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** This is merely a procedural move, as coach Kyle Shanahan has circled (in his mind) a Week 6 road matchup with the Buccaneers as a possible date for Aiyuk to make his 2025 debut, per Vic Tafur of The Athletic. With this move from active/PUP to reserve/PUP, though, Aiyuk technically can return to action as early as Thursday, Oct. 2 at the Rams. He remains in recovery mode from the ACL and MCL tears that he sustained in his right knee Week 7 of last season. With Demarcus Robinson suspended for the first three games of the season, Jauan Jennings (calf) and Ricky Pearsall are the top wide receivers on San Francisco's active roster.
#### Chris Godwin Jr. (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Godwin suffered a season-ending dislocated left ankle in Week 7 of last season that required surgery. In early March, he inked a three-year, $66 million contract to remain with the Buccaneers, and while there was optimism from coach Todd Bowles during the offseason program that Godwin may be available for the beginning of the 2025 campaign, he opened training camp on active/PUP. Now that he's been cleared to practice, the veteran wideout can return to action as soon as Week 1, although an October return still appears likely, per Adam Schefter of ESPN. By keeping him off the PUP list, which would require a minimum four-game absence, the Bucs are at least keeping open the possibility of a late September return. As long as Godwin remains sidelined, Mike Evans and rookie first-round pick Emeka Egbuka will serve as the team's top two wide receivers with Jalen McMillan out due to a sprained neck.
#### Zach Ertz (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Ertz and John Bates are both being rested -- in Ertz's case for a third straight week -- while 2024 second-round pick Ben Sinnott isn't among the 33 names being held out. It's the latest sign that Sinnott has made no real progress toward usurping Ertz, although there's perhaps still some risk it eventually happens. In any case, Ertz gets a solid target projection for Week 1 against the Giants, putting him in play as a lineup option even though he was drafted as a backup (or not at all) in most fantasy leagues. The uncertainty surrounding Terry McLaurin (contract) and Noah Brown (undisclosed injury) could further boost Ertz's volume outlook as the opener draws near, with the wideouts potentially having workload limitations even if they both end up playing (following prolonged absences this summer).
