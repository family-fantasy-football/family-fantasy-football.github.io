## Player Report

#### Khalil Shakir (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Shakir had an acrobatic catch overturned by replay in the first quarter, and he otherwise had a quiet night despite tying for the team lead in receptions and targets. The fourth-year wideout had come into Monday on a reasonably productive run in which he produced a 11-124-1 receiving line on 14 targets over the prior pair of contests. He'll face a tough challenge against the talented Panthers secondary when the Bills take on Carolina on the road following their Week 7 bye.
#### Harold Fannin Jr. (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Fannin continued to showcase rapport with Dillon Gabriel, as he led the Browns in receptions and yards. He did do the majority of his damage with the Steelers playing conservative defense in the fourth quarter, with 56 of Fannin's yards coming with the Browns down multiple scores. Even with that context, the rapport between Fannin and Gabriel is clear, as Fannin has 11 catches for 94 yards and a touchdown combined between the last two games.
#### Jake Ferguson (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Ferguson saw a season-low three targets, with Ryan Flournoy joining George Pickens and Javonte Williams as Dak Prescott's favorite targets. Ferguson was productive with the opportunity he saw, hauling in a 19-yard touchdown just before halftime. He has a touchdown in three straight games, though he could become more reliant upon efficiency with CeeDee Lamb (ankle) potentially in line for a Week 7 return.
#### George Pickens (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Pickens accounted for all three of Dallas' longest plays from scrimmage, recording catches of 45, 34 and 31 yards. That production came in a variety of ways, as he served in his more traditional deep-threat role but also showcased his athleticism with hurdles and jukes to elude defenders. Pickens' touchdown came on a slant route over the middle of the field, and he out-raced defenders for a 34-yard score. He has at least one touchdown in five straight games and now has over 100 receiving yards in consecutive games, stepping up very well in the absence of CeeDee Lamb (ankle).
#### Jahmyr Gibbs (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Gibbs regained control of the Detroit backfield by a comfortable margin, out-touching David Montgomery 18-6. However, he had only five touches in the second half as the Lions were forced into a pass-heavy offense. Gibbs was inefficient with his opportunity on the ground, but the bigger concern is his lack of involvement as a pass catcher. He now has two or fewer catches in three consecutive games while recording a total of 39 receiving yards in that span. Despite some shortcomings in his profile, Gibbs' role in a strong offense will keep him as a must-start option, with Sunday's loss marking only the second time in six contests that he's failed to find the end zone.
#### Woody Marks (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Marks rotated within drives with Nick Chubb for most of the game, but he still ended up with four fewer carries. Neither back was able to get much going, and three of Marks' seven carries went for one yard or less. While it was a disappointing follow-up to what appeared to be a breakout performance in Week 5, game script didn't help as Houston pulled most of its offensive starters early in the fourth quarter.
#### Michael Pittman Jr. (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Pittman's output was below his usual standards, as all three components of his receiving line were season-low figures. The veteran wideout's lackluster afternoon coincided with the return of Alec Pierce from a two-game absence due to a concussion, although the two receivers have very different skill sets and roles within the offense. Given his numbers were essentially outliers, Pittman should have a good chance to bounce back to some degree during a Week 7 road showdown against the Chargers next Sunday.
#### Daniel Jones (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Jones put together another efficient performance that's become par for the course for him in the Colts' scheme. Jones eclipsed the 70.0 percent completion threshold for the fourth time overall in the first six games, and the veteran signal-caller also tossed a pair of touchdown for the second consecutive contest by connecting with Tyler Warren and Josh Downs from eight and five yards out, respectively. Jones added a three-yard scoring rush just before the halfway point of the second quarter, his fourth touchdown on the ground already. Jones will remain a highly coveted option in all formats for a Week 7 road showdown against the Chargers that could develop into a high-scoring affair.
#### Bhayshul Tuten (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The rookie fourth-round pick continues to operate as Jacksonville's No. 2 tailback but saw his smallest workload since the season opener Sunday. Tuten showcased his potential upside in Week 2 with 10 touches for 74 yards, but in the ensuing four contests he's totaled just 16 carries for 55 yards and four receptions for 27 yards. He's likely to remain in a limited role as long as Travis Etienne remains healthy.
#### Tre' Harris (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Harris was thrust into a larger offensive role Sunday due to Quentin Johnston being ruled out with a hamstring injury. Harris proceeded to play a season-high 53 snaps on offense  and finished tied with Keenan Allen for third on the Chargers in both catches and receiving yards. Harris' would revert to a rotational role for Week 7 against the Colts if Johnston were cleared to return.
#### Justin Herbert (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Despite being under duress for most of the game, Herbert was excellent moving around the pocket and extending time to create enough room to hit Ladd McConkey (7-100-1) on a number of crossing routes, while Oronde Gadsden had his biggest game of his young career as an underneath safety net. The emergence of Kimani Vidal as a legitimate piece of the rushing attack, albeit against a porous run defense, could do wonders to help Herbert steady the ship with multiple offensive lineman banged up with varying injuries.
#### Davante Adams (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Adams served as the Rams' top pass-catcher for most of the game with Puka Nacua (ankle) briefly sidelined and then playing at less than full strength for most of the game. Adams led the team with nine targets, but he converted that into his lowest yardage total of the season. Touchdowns have masked his underwhelming stat lines through the first seven games of the season, as Adams has now been held under 60 receiving yards in four of six contests.
#### T.J. Hockenson (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The veteran tight end continued to play a short-area role and finished as the runner-up in receptions for the Vikings while also tying for second in targets. Hockenson provided some key contributions on the Vikings' game-winning drive late in the fourth quarter, making two catches for 20 yards during the possession. He has between four and six receptions in his last three games, but he's yet to top 49 receiving yards in any contest this season heading into the Week 6 bye.
#### Drake Maye (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** The second-year QB was sharp right from the coin toss, hitting DeMario Douglas and Kayshon Boutte for long TDs in the first quarter before adding another 29-yard score to Boutte just before halftime right after New Orleans had taken a 16-14 lead. Maye has tossed multiple touchdowns in four of the last five games, posting an impressive 9:1 TD:INT over that stretch and leading New England to three straight wins. He'll look to keep rolling in Week 7 against the Titans.
#### Alvin Kamara (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** After dealing with an ankle injury during the week in practice, Kamara didn't seem particularly bothered by the issue as he saw at least 15 touches for the fourth time in the last five games and  produced 70-plus scrimmage yards for the third time in that span. Kamara has 314 rushing yards and a 22-122-0 receiving line on 26 targets through six contests, but a Week 1 rushing TD has been his only trip to the end zone so far. He'll look to end his scoring drought in Week 7 against the Bears.
#### Ricky Pearsall (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** questionable
