## Player Report

#### Bryce Young (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The third-year QB had another rough start to an NFL campaign, and Young's only TD pass came late in the fourth quarter when the game already was out of hand. He did show flashes of chemistry with new top wideout Tetairoa McMillan (5-68-0 on nine targets), the eighth overall pick in the 2025 Draft, but otherwise there weren't many positives to take away from this performance. Young will try to clean things up on the road Week 2 against the Cardinals.
#### Chase Brown (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** The Bengals' offense was sluggish in their Week 1 win, and Brown's performance was a mix of positive and negative. He was very inefficient, averaging only 2.0 yards per carry with a long gain of eight yards. On the other hand, Brown was the only Bengals running back to get a carry, and he also converted a one-yard touchdown at the goal line. While the stat line wasn't particularly strong, Brown's usage will keep him locked in as one of the best fantasy options at the position.
#### Jerry Jeudy (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Jeudy saw decent target volume overall, though Joe Flacco distributed the ball evenly to Harold Fannin, Cedric Tillman and Dylan Sampson. Jeudy narrowly led the team in receiving yards thanks to a meaningless catch in the final seconds of the game to turn in a passable fantasy line. However, he also dropped a target on fourth down early in the fourth quarter and had a pass deflect off his hands to turn the ball over earlier in the contest. Jeudy should have the chance to put together decent fantasy performances so long as Joe Flacco is under center, but it would be reassuring to see him command a higher rate of targets in Week 2 against the Ravens.
#### Brenton Strange (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** The third-year tight end finished second on the Jaguars in receptions to rookie WR/CB Travis Hunter, but Strange not only led the team in receiving yardage, he was on the other end of Trevor Lawrence's longest completion of the day, a 24-yard toss on the opening drive to help set up a Cam Little field goal. Strange set career-best numbers in 2024 while working behind Evan Engram, but with Engram now in Denver, Strange could be poised for a true breakout in 2025. He'll look to build on Sunday's performance on the road in Week 2 against the Bengals.
#### Trevor Lawrence (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** It was an odd game that saw the Jaguars take a 20-3 lead into halftime, but only after a lengthy weather delay in the middle of the second quarter due to lightning. Whether that delay impacted Lawrence's performance is tough to say, but he didn't need to do much in the second half. New coach Liam Coen led Baker Mayfield to a career-best season with the Buccaneers in 2024, and while he could eventually do the same for Lawrence, the jury is very much still out. Lawrence will look to deliver better numbers on the road Week 2 in what could be a barn burner against Joe Burrow and the Bengals.
#### Xavier Worthy (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** "I know Xavier's the big question, and he's rehabbing and working his shoulder," Reid said. "We'll just see where it goes day by day here - see where we end up." Reid was careful with his words, refusing to commit to a firm timetable for the second-year receiver. For what it's worth, Adam Schefter of ESPN said Monday that Worthy is likely to miss some time. Fantasy players will need to closely monitor Worthy's practice habits in the coming days and weeks. If Worthy is unable to play Week 2, Kansas City likely will roll with Hollywood Brown, JuJu Smith-Schuster and Tyquan Thornton as its top three receivers versus Philadelphia.
#### Patrick Mahomes (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Mahomes quickly lost his most explosive playmaker when Xavier Worthy went down with a shoulder injury just four plays into the game. The two-time MVP battled throughout the rest of the contest while repeatedly leading the Chiefs from behind, and he offered some hope with an 11-yard touchdown run and 37-yard scoring strike to Travis Kelce in the third and fourth quarter, respectively. In the absence of Worthy, Mahomes recorded completions to seven different targets, focusing the bulk of his attention on Hollywood Brown (10-99-0) and JuJu Smith-Schuster (5-55-0), who were the targets on 21 of his pass attempts. Following this season-opening stumble, Mahomes and the Chiefs will have to quickly turn their focus to a Super Bowl LIX rematch with the Eagles at Arrowhead Stadium in a Week 2 matchup on Sunday, Sept. 14.
#### Aaron Jones Sr. (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Jones saw new backfield mate Jordan Mason outpace him by seven carries and 45 rushing yards, but the former made a significant impact as a receiver. Jones shared the team lead in receiving yards with Justin Jefferson, and he also recorded a nifty 27-yard touchdown grab down the right side of the field with just under 10 minutes remaining in the fourth quarter. It remains to be seen if Monday night's ground-attack pecking order will have staying power, but it's conceivable the 30-year-old Jones, who logged a career-high 255 carries over 17 regular-season games in 2024 and came into the season with 1,432 career rush attempts, is slotted into more of a complementary role on the ground behind the younger Mason on the majority of weeks while still retaining a solid pass-catching role.
#### Stefon Diggs (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Making his team debut and suiting up for his first taste of game action since Week 8 of last season with the Texans, Diggs finished tied for the team lead in receptions while checking in second in targets. While nothing spectacular from a fantasy perspective, Diggs' numbers were encouraging considering it was his first experience working with quarterback Drake Maye in a game setting, and it appears evident he'll be a key target for the second-year signal-caller moving forward. Diggs next takes aim at a defense he's highly familiar with from his days with the Bills, that of the Dolphins, in a Week 2 road matchup next Sunday.
#### Cam Skattebo (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The rookie fourth-round pick struggled in his NFL debut, but there are a couple silver linings to be found in this forgettable performance. Skattebo got a chance by the goal line with a carry from the 1-yard line in the second quarter, though he lost a yard on the play, and lead back Tyrone Tracy didn't exactly separate from the pack with just 24 yards on 10 carries. The 219-pound Skattebo could eventually emerge as the short-yardage back over the 210-pound Tracy, and Skattebo showed promise as a pass catcher in training camp, but his short-term role could be limited in a Giants backfield that also includes Tracy and Devin Singletary. Up next for Big Blue is a Week 2 road game in Dallas.
#### Braelon Allen (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Allen was stopped short on a two-point conversion attempt in the first quarter but bounced back with an eight-yard touchdown run in the second quarter. His five other carries produced just one yard, while Breece Hall turned 21 touches into 145 yards. The 6-foot-1, 235-pound Allen could work as the more powerful complement to the shifty Hall in a run-heavy Jets offense, but Allen won't get many opportunities if he continues to get stuffed on the majority of his carries. Allen will look to improve his efficiency in Week 2 against the Bills.
#### Bucky Irving (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Both Irving and Falcons counterpart Bijan Robinson were stymied by the opposing front seven, but each also found a way to get into the end zone as a receiver. Irving's nine-yard touchdown grab in the third quarter was particularly critical for his fantasy day, as it prevented what would have otherwise been a total washout in that regard. Irving also saw a bit of a lesser rushing workload than might have been expected in the back-and-forth affair, and he could have an uphill climb to an efficient performance again in a Week 2 Monday night road matchup against the Texans on Sept. 15.
#### Chris Godwin Jr. (WR)
**Injury Status:** Out <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** After requiring an initial surgery in October 2024 to repair a dislocated left ankle, Godwin underwent a follow-up procedure in the spring to tighten up the hardware inserted during the prior surgery. Though Godwin hasn't hit any unexpected snags in the recovery process, he has yet to resume practicing and is on track to miss at least a few more games before taking the field for the Buccaneers. Though Tampa Bay could have placed Godwin on a reserve list to open up a spot on the 53-man roster, the team avoided doing so with the hope that the veteran wideout will be able to resume practicing within the next few weeks. He'll likely need to turn in a full practice at some point during Week 5 to have a realistic shot at playing against the Seahawks, though the Buccaneers believe that a Week 6 or 7 return could be in the forecast for Godwin if he needs a little extra time to fully ramp up.
#### Zach Ertz (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** After scoring six touchdowns in the last seven games of the 2024 regular season, Ertz picked up where he left off with a seven-yard touchdown catch in the first quarter. The 34-year-old tight end remains a reliable red-zone target for Jayden Daniels in an explosive Commanders offense. Ertz will try to continue his scoring binge Thursday in Green Bay.
