## üè• Player Report

### üî¥ Lamar Jackson (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### üü¢ Dillon Gabriel (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The rookie wasn't asked to do much, and the fact the Browns were able to jump out to a 17-6 halftime lead gave head coach Kevin Stefanski flexibility in how he deployed his young signal-caller. Quinshon Judkins, who scored three rushing touchdowns, and the Browns defense, which picked off Tua Tagovailoa three times and also recorded a pair of sacks, did most of the heavy lifting, leading to Gabriel's lowest passing yardage total yet in three games as a starter. The 2025 third-round pick will face off with Drake Maye and the Patriots on the road in Week 8 next Sunday afternoon.
</div>

### üü¢ Quinshon Judkins (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> As expected, Judkins handled significant volume on the ground against what had been a vulnerable Dolphins run defense, but he was just one run away from actually disappointing profoundly from an efficiency basis. The rookie back's season-long 46-yard run, which went for a touchdown early in the second quarter, was the first of a career-high three scores for Judkins and helped obscure the fact he netted a scant 38 yards on his other 24 carries. Nevertheless, the three trips to the end zone pushed Judkins' TD total to five in just six games, and he'll look for per-carry success in a Week 8 road matchup against the Patriots.
</div>

### üü¢ Jameson Williams (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The usually sure-handed Williams failed to haul in either of his targets on a low-volume passing night dominated by Detroit's run game. The 24-year-old has been a hit-or-miss fantasy asset through seven weeks, doing most of his damage in two big-scoring games. Williams couldn't improve on his 17-289-2 receiving line Monday as the Lions prepare to enter a bye week. The Alabama product should continue to be treated as a risky high-upside play against the Vikings in Week 9.
</div>

### üü° Nico Collins (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Collins hit his head hard on the turf on a contested catch attempt early in the fourth quarter. He was evaluated in the medical tent before walking to the locker room for further evaluation. Collins now will face a short week to pass the league's protocols ahead of a Week 8 matchup against San Francisco.
</div>

### üü¢ Jonathan Taylor (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Colts offense just keeps on rolling, and Taylor has been its engine, scoring from 23 yards out in the first quarter Sunday before dashing for eight and 19-yard scores in the third. It's the third time in seven games this season that Taylor has gotten into the end zone three times, en route to an NFL-best 11 TDs in total (10 rushing, one receiving) and 882 yards from scrimmage. He seems unlikely to be slowed down in Week 8 by the Titans.
</div>

### üü¢ Brock Bowers (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Out<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Bowers hasn't played since Week 4 due to a lingering PCL injury and bone bruise, but the star tight end is expected to be back in the lineup Week 9 versus the Jaguars on Sunday, Nov. 2. Carroll said the same of wide receiver Jakobi Meyers (knee/toe), who joined Bowers on the sideline during the team's blowout 31-0 loss to Kansas City in Week 7. Bowers surpassed 100 receiving yards Week 1 but then logged three consecutive games below the 50-yard mark and without a touchdown while playing through his knee injury, so fantasy managers will hope he's able to return to both full health and his usual productivity levels when back in the lineup.
</div>

### üü¢ Kimani Vidal (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> After a huge Week 6 performance against the Dolphins as the Chargers' lead back, Vidal had much less success in Week 7. While he still led Los Angeles in carries, Justin Herbert actually led the team in rushing yards with a meager 31. With Omarion Hampton (IR, ankle) likely still more than a month away from his return, Vidal will maintain his spot at the top of the depth chart heading into a Week 8 clash with a Vikings defense that just held Saquon Barkley to 44 rushing yards and 2.4 yards per carry.
</div>

### üü¢ Tua Tagovailoa (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Tagovailoa was benched late in the fourth quarter of Miami's 31-6 loss to the Browns in Week 7, a matchup that saw the fifth-year pro succumb to adverse weather conditions and throw three interceptions with zero touchdowns and only 130 passing yards. He had previously also thrown three interceptions in the Dolphins' loss to the Chargers in Week 6. Rookie seventh-round pick Quinn Ewers didn't fare much better than Tagovailoa, as he nearly threw an INT on his first snap, fumbled two plays later and ended the game with five completions for 53 yards on eight pass attempts. Now sitting at a 1-6 record, McDaniel and Tagovialoa may both be at risk of losing their positions if the team can't right the ship against the Falcons, a task that will be all the more difficult with tight end Darren Waller (pectoral) looking unlikely to be available.
</div>

### üü¢ Jaylen Waddle (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Tua Tagovailoa threw for just 100 yards while barely completing more than 50.0 percent of his passes before giving way to Quinn Ewers in garbage time, so Waddle's line is slightly less alarming within that context. Nevertheless, the veteran receiver's numbers were season lows across the board, and his catch total was also a new career-worst mark. The Dolphins offense had its worst day of the season overall Sunday, and even though Waddle could bounce back to an extent in a Week 8 road matchup against the Falcons, meaningful production will remain hard to come by if Tagovailoa continues to struggle with ball security and efficiency.
</div>

### üü¢ Jordan Mason (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Mason saw opportunities limited somewhat by game script at certain points, but the offseason addition put together a serviceable performance that he rounded out with his fourth rushing touchdown of the season via a one-yard run late in the third quarter. He has topped out at Sunday's rushing yardage total in the last three games following a 116-yard, two-touchdown tally versus the Bengals in Week 3, but he should remain the lead back in a Week 8 road matchup against the Chargers on Thursday night as long as Aaron Jones (hamstring) remains on injured reserve.
</div>

### üü¢ Jordan Addison (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Addison led the Vikings across the board in receptions, receiving yards and targets with figures that also all qualified as season highs. The third-year pro's longest catch went for 34 yards, so he consistently was able to record significant gains during the high-scoring, back-and-forth affair. Addison has displayed excellent chemistry with fill-in quarterback Carson Wentz after the wide receiver's suspension-delayed start to the season, and he's likely to continue working with him in a Thursday night Week 8 road matchup against the Chargers since J.J. McCarthy (ankle) is unlikely to be ready to return with the short turnaround.
</div>

### üü° Garrett Wilson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### üü¢ Jaylen Warren (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Warren came just two yards short of his single-game career high in rushing yards, which he set against the Browns back on Nov. 19, 2023. The versatile back was in outstanding form against a Bengals defense that had been particularly prone to allowing chunk plays on the ground, compiling a season-high yardage total with the help of four runs of 10+ yards and a co-game-long 37-yard scamper. Warren also has at least four catches in three of the last four contests, and Thursday's performance affords him plenty of momentum heading into a Week 8 home showdown against the Packers on Sunday night, Oct. 26.
</div>

### üü¢ Jauan Jennings (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jennings was dealing with a myriad of minor injuries before being cleared of all designations leading up to Sunday's kick off. The 27-year-old operated as the 49ers' top wideout with Ricky Pearsall (knee) and Brandon Aiyuk (knee) still unavailable for Week 7. Jennings' 31 receiving yards and seven targets led all San Francisco receivers not named Christian McCaffrey, who carried the offense with 201 yards from scrimmage and two touchdowns. Look for Jennings' production to improve alongside his health as the season progresses. Up next is a road tilt against the Texans next Sunday.
</div>

### üü¢ AJ Barner (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Barner finished in the relatively unfamiliar position of second in receiving yardage and tied with Jaxon Smith-Njigba for the longest reception of the game. That catch covered a distance of 61 yards on the first play of Seattle's game-clinching drive, with Barner getting loose down the middle of the field after making the reception and taking the ball down to the Jaguars' 12-yard line. Barner has now set new single-game season highs in receiving yards in three consecutive contests, but he's typically much more of a shorter-area target for Sam Darnold and will remain a complementary pass-catching option in a tough Week 7 home matchup against the Texans on Monday night, Oct. 20.
</div>

### üü¢ Tyjae Spears (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Titans attempted only 12 rushes in the game, with Spears splitting the workload almost exactly evenly with Tony Pollard. More surprising was that Pollard out-produced him as a pass catcher, a role that Spears had seemingly taken over since his return to the field. While he's added an element to the Tennessee offense, the unit is poor enough that Spears won't be able to sustain fantasy vlaue so long as he's in a split with Pollard.
