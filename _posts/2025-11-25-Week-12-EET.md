## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟡 Drake London (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 Justice Hill (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Hill was back in action after missing Week 11 with a toe injury. However, he was not involved in the game plan, as he played 25 percent of the snaps and did not record a touch. Hill has not played more than 19 snaps in any of his four games since the bye, nor has he gotten more than one carry in any of those outings. Fellow running back Keaton Mitchell is still not out-snapping Hill, but he tends to get the ball when he's on the field. Hill and the Ravens return to action Thanksgiving night against the Bengals.
</div>

### 🟢 Joshua Palmer (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Palmer played exactly half of Buffalo's 66 snaps on offense, behind Khalil Shakir (67 percent) and Gabe Davis (55 percent) but ahead of Elijah Moore (41 percent) and Tyrell Shavers (39 percent) while Keon Coleman (coach's decision) was inactive for a second consecutive game. Palmer and Shakir linked up for a drive-extending lateral to convert fourth-and-27 on Buffalo's final possession, as Palmer caught an 11-yard pass and found Shakir in-stride behind him for an additional 33-yard gain. Josh Allen was picked off four plays later as the Bills dropped to 7-4 ahead of a Week 13 trip to Pittsburgh.
</div>

### 🟢 Courtland Sutton (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The veteran matched Troy Franklin in receptions and targets, but it was the second-year wideout who paced Denver with 84 receiving yards. Sutton has become the 1B to Franklin's 1A in the Broncos' passing game, and over the last six games he's posted a 19-284-1 line on 37 targets compared to Franklin's 25-278-4 line on 49 targets.
</div>

### 🟢 Jakobi Meyers (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Meyers finally hit pay dirt with his first touchdown as a member of the Jaguars since being traded from the Raiders on Nov. 4. It was also the veteran wideout's first touchdown of the season after being held scoreless over his previous nine appearances overall. Meyers has become more comfortable in Jacksonville's offense with each passing week, which should excite fantasy managers with thoughts of a strong run to close out the regular season. The 28-year-old will attempt to build off of this strong performance in a road tilt against Tennessee next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Trevor Lawrence (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Lawrence managed to overcome a season-high four turnovers in order to secure victory for his club Sunday. The 25-year-old matched his previous high of three touchdown passes set back in Week 2 against the Bengals, which was also the only other game this season during which he has thrown multiple interceptions. The first-overall selection in the 2021 NFL Draft continues to produce inconsistent fantasy results in his fifth season as a pro. Lawrence has thrown 14 touchdowns to 11 interceptions while failing to eclipse 300 passing yards in any of his 11 starts this season, numbers that keep him in the middle tier of starting QB options against Tennessee next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Hollywood Brown (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The veteran finished second among Kansas City wideouts in receptions, behind Rashee Rice's six but ahead of Xavier Worthy's three. Brown hasn't seen more than four targets in any of the last five games, posting a 12-172-3 line on 17 targets during that stretch, but he's remained involved in the passing attack since Rice made his season debut. Brown will look to get back into the end zone for the first time since Week 7 in a Week 12 clash with the Colts.
</div>

### 🟢 Aaron Jones Sr. (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jones actually saw a pretty typical workload despite the negative game script, getting to the nine-carry mark for the fourth straight contest. The veteran back had one more rush attempt than backfield mate Jordan Mason, and he recorded multiple receptions for the fifth straight contest. Jones and Mason should continue in their near-even timeshare during a Week 13 road battle against the Seahawks next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Saquon Barkley (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Eagles' offense was very efficient to begin the game, but Barkley was never able to get on track. He averaged 3.2 yards per carry or less for the third straight game, with his longest gain on the ground going for only seven yards. Positively, Barkley topped four receptions for the first time since joining the Eagles, though even that was tarnished by a fumble midway through the fourth quarter in Dallas territory. Barkley should have a chance to bounce back in a Week 13 matchup against the Bears, but he's struggled to get on track for most of the season.
</div>

### 🟢 George Kittle (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Kittle finished Monday's primetime tilt as the game's leading receiver off a season-high 10 targets. The 31-year-old has really found his groove since going catchless in his return from a hamstring injury Week 7, providing fantasy managers with a 29-304-4 receiving line over his last five starts. Kittle may be asked to utilize his elite blocking skills more than usual Week 13 in order to help the offensive line deal with the unstoppable force that is DE Myles Garrett when the 49ers visit the Browns on Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Brock Purdy (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Purdy had a first half he would like to forget after getting picked off by Carolina's secondary on three consecutive possessions. The trio of turnovers followed an impressive 15-play, 72-yard opening drive that culminated in a touchdown strike to WR Jauan Jennings. Head coach Kyle Shanahan gave his signal-caller a vote of confidence heading into halftime, telling ESPN's Lisa Salters that he felt Purdy played well outside of missing his mark on two of the three interceptions. The Iowa State product took better care of the ball in the second half, leading a couple of scoring drives to finish off the Panthers in the primetime victory. Monday's shoddy results coupled with a brutal upcoming matchup against Cleveland's defense Sunday should suppress Purdy's fantasy value Week 13.
</div>

### 🟢 Rashid Shaheed (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Shaheed played 55 percent of the offensive snaps during his third game with the Seahawks, but he has yet to do much offensively, registering three catches on eight targets for 30 yards and four carries for 27 yards in the span. It will be difficult for fantasy managers to pinpoint when he might finally break a big play, making him a risky option with his new club. His next chance to make an impact will come in Week 13 versus the Vikings.
</div>

### 🟢 Tony Pollard (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Pollard continued to work as Tennessee's lead back, totaling 15 touches compared to seven for Tyjae Spears. He wasn't particularly effective as either a pass catcher or rusher, and he's now been held below 50 yards from scrimmage in consecutive games. The lone positive for Pollard has been his increased involvement as a pass catcher, as he's combined to record seven catches in his last two matchups.
</div>

### 🟢 Zach Ertz (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The veteran tight end tied Deebo Samuel for the team lead in targets, but the wideout did a lot more (7-74-1) with his volume. Ertz was also the intended target on Marcus Mariota's only interception of the afternoon on the first play of OT, setting up Miami's winning field goal. Ertz will head into a Week 12 bye with a 39-387-4 line on 57 targets, and his role in the offense seems secure regardless of whether Mariota or Jayden Daniels (elbow) is under center in Week 13 against the Broncos.
