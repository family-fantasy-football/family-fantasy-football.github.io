## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Bijan Robinson (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Fresh off of recording a new career high in total yardage (181) in the Falcons' last win, Robinson wasted no time setting a new high-water mark with 238 yards from scrimmage against the Bills. The majority of the fantasy star's production came on the ground this time around, with Monday's 170 rushing yards representing another career best. Robinson is providing a whopping 164.4 combined yards per game for his managers this season. To put that into perspective, the Texas product averaged 111.0 total yards per game over the course of his breakout fantasy campaign in 2024. Robinson's domination of opposing defenses should continue Week 7 against a 49ers defense that will be without star players Fred Warner (ankle) and Nick Bosa (knee).
</div>

### 🟢 Xavier Legette (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Since returning from injury in Carolina's Week 5 win over the Dolphins, Legette has been targeted just five times, catching four passes for 42 yards and a touchdown over the team's last two games. He was outpaced by rookie wideouts Tetairoa McMillan (3-39-2) and Jimmy Horn (2-36-0), finishing sixth on the team in receiving yards during Sunday's victory. Although the second-year pro continues to operate as the Panthers' No. 2 wide receiver, his involvement has been limited, with most of the team's offensive production coming from McMillan and Rico Dowdle. Legette draws another great matchup in Week 7 against a struggling Jets defense, but he's still unlikely to make a meaningful fantasy impact.
</div>

### 🟢 Colston Loveland (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Loveland has five receptions this season, and limited usage keeps him a watch-list tight end until his usage increases.
</div>

### 🟢 Dylan Sampson (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Sampson had his highest usage since Week 1, including a turn as the primary kickoff returner. Once Quinshon Judkins was established as the lead back, Sampson's role evaporated. He had just four touches over the last three weeks, while getting single-digit snaps in all three contests.
</div>

### 🟢 Jaydon Blue (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The rookie running back saw only five snaps (nine percent) on offense as Javonte Williams continues to dominate the workload in the Dallas backfield. Blue did gain 40 yards on two kickoff returns, but even that role will disappear once KaVontae Turpin (foot) gets healthy. Blue's only fantasy value right is as insurance against a Williams injury.
</div>

### 🟢 Bo Nix (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Nix played the role of game manager for Denver in a gritty defensive victory overseas in London. The 25-year-old did not complete a pass for the entirety of the third quarter, which helped contribute to his second-lowest yardage output as a passer this season. On the bright side, Nix was involved in the only touchdown scored for either side Sunday, delivering a 16-yard strike to TE Nate Adkins in the first quarter. With nine touchdowns thrown to four interceptions through six starts, Nix checks in as a middling fantasy option in Week 7 when the Broncos host the Giants next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Kalif Raymond (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Raymond was cleared to play after suffering a neck injury in Week 5, but he only logged two snaps on offense and one snap with the special-teams unit. The wide receiver will look to be more involved Week 7 versus the Buccaneers after having an additional week to return to form following his injury.
</div>

### 🟢 Geno Smith (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Smith got the Raiders back in the win column after a recent poor string of play had critics calling for a quarterback change in Las Vegas. The veteran signal-caller appears to have staved off a potential QB controversy with improved play against a struggling Titans squad Sunday. The 34-year-old still couldn't pitch a clean outing, throwing his 10th interception of campaign early in the fourth quarter. The late turnover didn't cost his team a chance at victory, meaning Smith should remain under center for a tough road matchup against the Chiefs next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟡 Puka Nacua (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> McVay previously labeled Nacua "day-to-day" due to the left low-ankle sprain the star wideout suffered during the Rams' win over the Ravens this past Sunday, but his status remains uncertain for a Week 7 matchup against the Jaguars. In order to have any chance of suiting up this Sunday, Nacua will likely need to log at least limited practice activity Thursday and/or Friday. The Rams have an upcoming Week 8 bye, however, so it's possible that the team could simply allow Nacua to rest and target a tentative return in Week 9 against the Saints on Nov. 2.
</div>

### 🟢 Kyren Williams (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Rams possessed the ball for only 22:05 of game time while averaging only 4.7 yards per play. That led to modest stat lines for the entire skills corps, though Williams was on the better end of things thanks to a three-yard touchdown run early in the third quarter. One play earlier, he made a falling 30-yard reception on fourth down that kept the drive alive. Overall, Williams delivered a well-rounded stat line and also kept the ball secure after losing a fumble in each of his last two games.
</div>

### 🟢 Kendre Miller (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> After back-to-back games with double-digit carries, Miller was stonewalled for his second-least efficient rushing performance of the season. The third-year running back has now averaged 7.6 carries per game this season. Over the last three games, he's averaging 9.6 rushing attempts for 42.3 yards per contest while operating as the No. 2 running back behind Alvin Kamara. Miller will look to remain involved in his backup role during the Week 7 matchup versus the Bears on Sunday, Sept. 19.
</div>

### 🟢 Tank Bigsby (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Bigsby hasn't played a single offensive snap since being acquired by the Eagles after Week 1. He's the fourth running back on the Eagles' depth chart, so even an injury to Saquon Barkley likely wouldn't be enough for him to move into a meaningful role.
</div>

### 🟡 Emeka Egbuka (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Though the Buccaneers will get receiver Mike Evans back on the practice field Thursday for the first time since he suffered a hamstring injury in a Week 3 win over the Jets, Egbuka is one of three key skill-position players who will sit out the team's first Week 7 session. Along with Egbuka, wideout Chris Godwin (fibula) and running back Bucky Irving (shoulder/foot) will be sidelined Thursday, and the statuses of all three players appear to be in doubt for Monday's contest in Detroit. Before having his day cut short by a hamstring injury in this past Sunday's 30-19 win over the 49ers, Egbuka had taken full advantage of Evans and Godwin missing time over the first five contests, compiling a 25-445-5 receiving line on 38 targets while adding nine rushing yards during that stretch.
</div>

### 🟢 Cade Otton (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Otton paced the Buccaneers in targets and receptions while finishing with his second-highest yardage total of the season. Part of the reason the tight end was featured so prominently Sunday was the early departure of star rookie Emeka Egbuka. Otton remained scoreless through six starts, but he is getting involved downfield more often as Tampa Bay deals with injuries at the wideout position. Otton will look to build a hot streak with another strong showing against the Lions next Monday.
</div>

### 🟡 Calvin Ridley (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> That was also the case a day before, and with Ridley poised to record another 'DNP' on Thursday, what the wideout is able to at practice Friday, if anything, will be pivotal with regard to his chances of suiting up Sunday against the Patriots. If he's sidelined this weekend, Van Jefferson would likely see an expanded role in Week 7, provided he's available after being limited by an ankle issue Wednesday.
</div>

### 🟡 Deebo Samuel (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> He played through the same injury the past two games, putting up an 8-96-1 receiving line in Week 5 before slumping to 4-15-0 in Week 6. Samuel topped a 70 percent snap share in both games, but the Commanders might ease up on his workload some if the heel continues to give him trouble and WR Terry McLaurin (quad) is available to pick up slack. McLaurin is returning to practice this week, but it isn't yet clear if he'll be ready for Sunday's game at Dallas. Samuel also needs to be monitored, and there will be serious concern if he doesn't return to practice by Friday.
