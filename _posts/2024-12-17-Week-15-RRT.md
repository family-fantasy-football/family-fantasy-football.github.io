## Player Report

#### Marvin Harrison Jr. (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** It was an inefficient day at the office for Harrison, who recorded just 32 receiving yards on a 33 percent catch rate. A one-sided game script in favor of Arizona also hurt the wideout's fantasy potential Sunday, as this contest was never close despite the 13-point difference once the game clock hit zero. Harrison owns a 47-687-7 receiving line through 14 starts as a rookie, with his next chance to play coming in a road tilt against Carolina next Sunday.
#### Trey McBride (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** McBride continued his dominance in between the 20s with another big PPR effort that resulted in no touchdowns. The 24-year-old has shockingly recorded 89 receptions for 938 yards with zero trips to the end zone in 13 starts this season. It will be curious to see if the budding tight end will reach the 1,000-yard receiving mark or score his first touchdown of 2024 first. We could find out the answer when McBride and the Cardinals face the Panthers next Sunday.
#### Diontae Johnson (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Johnson was suspended by Baltimore for Week 15 due to conduct detrimental to the team, but even after his suspension is officially lifted, the veteran wideout won't be back in the building to prepare for Saturday's divisional matchup against the Steelers. Since joining the Ravens in a trade with the Panthers back in October, Johnson has failed to solidify his standing in Baltimore's wide receiver corps. At this point, it remains to be seen whether the veteran wideout will return to team activities Week 17.
#### Rome Odunze (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Odunze was unable to replicate his two-score game from a week prior, instead providing fantasy managers with just two receptions in Monday's lopsided loss. The Bears' first-round rookies struggled to get on the same page after Caleb Williams connected with Odunze on just 29 percent of his throws against Minnesota. Odunze has potential to go off on a given week, but his floor is too low to rely on against the Lions on Sunday for managers making critical lineup decisions in the fantasy playoffs.
#### Chase Brown (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Brown scored his fourth receiving touchdown of the season on a six-yard catch in the first quarter and added his seventh rushing touchdown on a five-yard run with 1:09 remaining in the fourth quarter. The 2023 third-round pick also came just three yards shy of his second career 100-yard rushing performance. Brown has excelled in the lead role with seven total touchdowns in his last seven games, and he'll look to keep rolling in Week 16 against the Browns.
#### Jared Goff (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** The Lions went down 14-0 in the first quarter and played from behind the entire contest, which led to a season-high 59 pass attempts for Goff. He converted that into an excellent stat line, including his second-most yards in any game of his career while matching a career-high with five touchdowns. He also completed five passes of at least 20 yards, highlighted by a 66-yard touchdown connection with Amon-Ra St. Brown late in the third quarter. While this was an outlier performance, Goff has at least three passing scores in half of Detroit's 10 games since their Week 5 bye and should remain an excellent starting option heading into a Week 16 matchup against the Bears.
#### Cooper Kupp (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** The wet conditions certainly played a role, but seeing Kupp finish without a catch for the first time since Week 10 of the 2019 season and second time in his career still was shocking, not to mention especially ill-timed from a fantasy perspective. Kupp had entered Thursday with at least 60 receiving yards in five of the previous six games, and he'll naturally have nowhere to go but up in a Week 16 road matchup against the Jets on Sunday, Dec. 22.
#### Jaylen Waddle (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Waddle's status appears murky for Miami's upcoming matchup against the 49ers on Sunday, but it at least appears he's avoided a more severe outcome. Tyreek Hill remains available for the Dolphins, and if Waddle can't go Week 16, rookie sixth-round pick Malik Washington would be in a solid position to build upon the career-best 5-52-0 receiving line that he logged versus Houston. Further clarity on Waddle's status could arrive with Wednesday's first official injury report of Week 16.
#### De'Von Achane (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Achane doubled up Raheem Mostert in carries and finished with his highest rushing yardage total since Week 11. While Achane failed to average even 4.0 yards per carry for the fourth straight contest, he was once again heavily involved as a receiver. He's recorded at least six catches in three straight games, but he'll aim to get back on track on the ground in a Week 16 home matchup against a 49ers defense that's had trouble against the run on occasion.
#### Justin Jefferson (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Jefferson brought in Sam Darnold's only touchdown pass of the night on a seven-yard catch with just over five minutes remaining in the first quarter. Jefferson tied Jordan Addison for the team lead in receptions and set the pace in both receiving yards and targets, a familiar position for the star wideout. Jefferson has eclipsed 70 receiving yards in four of the last five games and also has three total scores in the last pair of contests heading into a Week 16 road battle against the Seahawks.
#### Sam Darnold (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The Vikings had the luxury of running a balanced attack against the hapless Bears, so Darnold didn't have to do anywhere near as much as he had against the Falcons in Week 14. However, the veteran quarterback still put together a solid effort that saw him connect with seven different targets overall, including starting wideouts Justin Jefferson and Jordan Addison seven times apiece. Darnold's one scoring toss went to Jefferson as well from seven yards out with just over five minutes remaining in the first quarter, extending his streak with at least one touchdown pass to five games. Darnold now will turn his sights to what could be a tough Week 16 road date with the Seahawks on a short week.
#### Antonio Gibson (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Gibson followed up his first touchdown of the season with a well-rounded effort behind starter Rhamondre Stevenson (13-69-0). The 26-year-old Gibson is averaging 4.7 yards with the Patriots this season, a mark he hadn't sniffed since his impressive rookie campaign with Washington in 2020. Gibson can provide niche value for those in deep PPR formats for Week 16 against Buffalo.
#### Wan'Dale Robinson (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Robinson finished a distant runner-up across the board in all three receiving categories to Malik Nabers. The reliable third-year pro eclipsed the 70-catch mark on the season (71) with Sunday's production, and he heads into a favorable Week 16 road matchup against the Falcons with at least four receptions in four of the last five contests.
#### Allen Lazard (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** IR <br>
**Details:** Lazard has displayed butter fingers throughout his tenure with the Jets, and he had an especially costly drop Sunday on a dime from Aaron Rodgers that should have been a 30-yard touchdown. Anders Carlson missed a field-goal attempt on the very next play, though Lazard's struggles ultimately didn't prevent the Jets from notching their fourth win of the season. For the second consecutive game since Lazard returned from IR, Davante Adams and Garrett Wilson combined for double-digit catches and well over 200 yards, leaving limited opportunities for the team's No. 3 wideout.
#### Breece Hall (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Hall wasn't efficient in his return after a one-game absence due to a knee injury, and he ceded a combined seven carries to Isaiah Davis and Braelon Allen, the latter of whom exited due to a back injury. The lead back salvaged his fantasy stat line with a one-yard rushing touchdown, which broke a 25-25 tie with 1:05 left in the fourth quarter. If Hall avoids any setbacks in practice, he'll likely get a larger workload in Week 16 against the Rams.
#### Braelon Allen (RB)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Before his departure, Allen carried twice for five yards. While he is sidelined, Breece Hall and Isaiah Davis are available to handle the Jets' backfield duties versus Jacksonville.
#### Dallas Goedert (TE)
**Injury Status:** Injured Reserve <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** This was reported earlier by various sources, but it was officially confirmed by the team later in the day. Grant Calcaterra and C.J. Uzomah will be tasked with taking on the work vacated by Goedert, who will be eligible to return during the team's final week of the regular season.
#### Geno Smith (QB)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Smith took a low hit from a Packers defender in the middle of the third quarter of Sunday's loss and limped to the sideline and eventually the locker room. He returned to the bench not long after, but he didn't retake the field, yielding QB duties to Sam Howell for the remainder of the contest. It seems that Smith has dodged a bullet, but it remains to be seen if he'll be able to do enough to gain clearance for this coming Sunday's game against the Vikings.
