## üè• Player Report

### üü° Bryce Young (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Canales also confirmed that Young remains day-to-day. If the third-year quarterback is able to get back on the field as at least a limited participant Wednesday, it will lend credence to the notion that he could retake the field Week 9 on the road against Green Bay. Andy Dalton drew the start during Carolina's blowout 40-9 loss to the Bills in Week 8, with Young having suffered a high-ankle sprain Week 7, but the veteran signal-caller was unable to get anything going under center. High-ankle sprains typically require multi-week absences to heal, but the Panthers have yet to rule Young out versus the Packers.
</div>

### üü¢ Rico Dowdle (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Dowdle logged four fewer carries than backfield mate Chuba Hubbard, but he outgained the latter by 20 rushing yards. In the two games since Hubbard's return from a calf injury, Dowdle has 123 rushing yards on 25 carries to his teammate's 26-65-1 line on the ground in the same span, but the two are likely to continue working in a close workload split during a Week 9 road tilt against the Packers next Sunday afternoon.
</div>

### üü¢ Noah Fant (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Fant tied for second on the team in targets, but 19 of Joe Flacco's 34 passes were directed toward Ja'Marr Chase. Fant has found success since Mike Gesicki (pectoral) went on injured reserve prior to Week 7 against the Steelers, catching all seven of his targets for 85 yards and a touchdown across two subsequent games. Fant will try to surpass 40 receiving yards for a third consecutive game in Week 9 against the Bears.
</div>

### üü¢ Chase Brown (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Brown's 19-yard touchdown catch in the second quarter marked his first trip to the end zone since he scored on the ground back in Week 1, and he tacked on a one-yard rushing touchdown in the fourth quarter. He also set a new season high with 105 scrimmage yards, topping his 100 against Pittsburgh in Week 7. Fellow Bengals running back Samaje Perine also had his best game of the season with 100 scrimmage yards and a touchdown, so Brown could face more competition for touches in a Bengals backfield that's trending up ahead of a Week 9 home game against the Bears.
</div>

### üü¢ Jerry Jeudy (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The veteran wideout continues to be an afterthought in the Browns' passing game, as tight ends David Njoku and Harold Fannin dominated the attention of rookie quarterback Dillon Gabriel. Jeudy has managed just a 9-75-0 line on 24 targets in Gabriel's four starts, and while the coaching staff might use a Week 9 bye to recalibrate the offense, Jeudy's fantasy appeal is at an all-time low.
</div>

### üü¢ Dak Prescott (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Prescott came in having thrown at least three touchdown passes in each of his previous four starts, but his momentum grounded to a halt against Denver's stout defense. He eventually came out of the game in the fourth quarter with the game out of reach, and backup Joe Milton promptly threw a touchdown pass, but it would take much more than that to create a quarterback controversy in Dallas. Prescott and the passing game will need to continue delivering big numbers to give the Cowboys a chance given Dallas' deficiencies on defense. Up next is a primetime home game against the Cardinals on Monday Night Football.
</div>

### üü¢ CeeDee Lamb (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Lamb led the Cowboys in targets and came up just four receiving yards short of George Pickens' team lead, but this was a quiet game by Lamb's lofty standards, as he had at least 110 receiving yards in each of the three previous games he finished this season. Denver's robust pass defense did well to slow down Dallas' aerial attack; Lamb drew a couple of pass interference penalties in the end zone, but the Cowboys didn't produce a passing touchdown until backup quarterback Joe Milton came in with the game already decided in the fourth quarter. Lamb's likely to face less sticky coverage in Week 9, when the Cowboys return home to host the Cardinals on Monday Night Football.
</div>

### üü¢ RJ Harvey (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Harvey scored on the ground via 40- and 1-yard carries, the first two rushing touchdowns of his NFL career, while adding a third receiving score to his season totals. Meanwhile, top running back J.K. Dobbins rushed for 111 yards on 15 carries and caught both of his targets for 10 yards. While Dobbins remains the lead backfield option for Denver, continued impressive performances on Harvey's part could allow his usage to steadily grow as the 2025 campaign continues. The rookie second-round pick will work to keep up his momentum Week 9 on the road versus Houston.
</div>

### üü¢ Patrick Mahomes (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Mahomes got off to a rocky start when he was picked off on Kansas City's first two offensive drives in Monday's primetime matchup. The resilient superstar settled in after halftime, rattling off three touchdown passes on consecutive drives out of the break. It was Mahomes' first start committing multiple turnovers this season, but it also was his third-straight appearance recording three scores for fantasy managers. The 29-year-old is putting up elite numbers again in 2025 after taking a step back over the previous two years. Mahomes checks in with 2,099 passing yards and 21 total touchdowns through eight starts as the Chiefs prepare to face Josh Allen and the Bills on Sunday in a Week 9 showdown of elite quarterbacks.
</div>

### üü¢ Xavier Worthy (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Worthy saw only four targets for the second consecutive game, a concerning trend given the return of Rashee Rice in Sunday's shutout win. Rice immediately came back to lead the team in every receiving stat and will likely remain Patrick Mahomes' favorite target moving forward. That will leave Worthy reliant on big plays to produce strong fantasy performances and make him more of a boom-or-bust option in future weeks.
</div>

### üü¢ Stefon Diggs (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Drake Maye didn't need to air it out too much, but the second-year quarterback still tossed three TDs in the third quarter to ice the game, with Diggs catching a one-yard score as part of the barrage. It was the veteran wideout's first touchdown of the season, a welcome sight for fantasy investors even if it came along with a season-low yardage total. Diggs will take a 42-470-1 line on 49 targets through eight games into a Week 9 clash with the Falcons.
</div>

### üü¢ TreVeyon Henderson (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> It was a career-best performance for the rookie running back, although Henderson's day was marred somewhat by a lost fumble, his first of the season. Rhamondre Stevenson led the Patriots with 14 carries, but he managed just 34 rushing yards on that volume, and the workload could begin to tip toward the freshman given his superior explosiveness. Henderson will look to build on this performance in Week 9 against the Falcons.
</div>

### üü¢ Cam Skattebo (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Out<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Daboll declined to go into any further detail about Skattebo's procedure or disclose an expected timetable for his recovery, per Stephen Whyno of the Associated Press. The rookie fourth-round pick suffered a dislocated right ankle during New York's loss to the Eagles in Week 8, for which he had to be carted off the field and transported to a local hospital. While it's encouraging that the procedure to repair Skattebo's injured ankle was successful, it remains to be seen whether he could have a chance to retake the field at some point this season. As long as Skattebo is unavailable, Tyrone Tracy will lead the Giants backfield, while Devin Singletary bumps into the No. 2 role. Tracy rushed 10 times for 39 yards and caught two of three targets for 14 yards (on 33 offensive snaps) versus Philadelphia, while Singletary had two carries for zero yards and secured his only target for a 28-yard gain (on eight offensive snaps).
</div>

### üü¢ Mason Taylor (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Taylor played through a quadriceps injury and led the Jets in targets. The first touchdown catch of his NFL career was a dramatic one, as running back Breece Hall found Taylor in the back of the end zone on a trick play for the game-winning score from four yards out just after the two-minute warning in the fourth quarter. The Jets could get some reinforcements at wide receiver if Garrett Wilson (knee) or Josh Reynolds (hip) can return after the team's Week 9 bye, but Taylor should remain involved as a pass catcher in the second half of his rookie campaign.
</div>

### üî¥ Brandon Aiyuk (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Out<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> On Friday, Shanahan told David Lombardi of SFStandard.com that Aiyuk's 21-day practice window may open this week, but even if it doesn't, the 49ers currently are in "week-to-week mode" with the wide receiver. Aiyuk is little more than one year removed from suffering ACL and MCL tears in his right knee Week 7 of the 2024 campaign, so he still may endure a significant ramp-up process even when he's cleared to practice.
</div>

### üü¢ Bucky Irving (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Out<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> out
</div>

### üü¢ Tez Johnson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Johnson's catch and yardage totals were both team highs on an afternoon when Baker Mayfield threw for just 152 yards. The rookie's reception tally also qualified as a new career high, as Johnson benefited considerably from the absences of Mike Evans (IR, collarbone/concussion) and Chris Godwin (fibula). While Godwin is likely to get healthy over Tampa Bay's Week 9 bye, Evans will be out until late in the season in a best-case scenario, ensuring Johnson should continue enjoying an elevated role for the foreseeable future.
