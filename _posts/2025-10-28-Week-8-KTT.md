## üè• Player Report

### üü¢ Tyler Allgeier (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> After a week in which he was limited in all three practices due to hip and knee injuries and listed as questionable, Allgeier will be available to a Falcons offense Week 8 that will be led by QB Kirk Cousins, who is getting a spot start for the injured Michael Penix (knee). Allgeier has averaged just 3.6 YPC on his 57 rushes in six contests this season, but he could take advantage of the touches that don't go to top RB Bijan Robinson against a Miami defense that has allowed the fourth-most YPC (5.2) to opposing running backs in 2025.
</div>

### üü¢ David Njoku (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> After missing last week's game with a knee issue, Njoku returned to action and made a splash with an 11-yard TD catch from Dillon Gabriel in the fourth quarter. The veteran also saw rookie Harold Fannin hit paydirt as well, and the duo have emerged as Gabriel's most reliable options, at the expense of the team's wideouts. Njoku will rest up on the Browns' Week 9 bye before facing the Jets in Week 10.
</div>

### üü¢ Troy Franklin (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Franklin matched his previous season highs in receptions (eight) and yards (89) set back in Week 2, but he usurped that fantasy score by hitting pay dirt twice in Week 8. The second-year wideout finished below 20 receiving yards in three out of the five contests in between his standout performances, highlighting his volatility as a fantasy asset on a week-to-week basis. Managers should be wary of Franklin's downside before starting him ahead of more-proven options in a tough matchup against the Texans next Sunday.
</div>

### üü° Brian Thomas Jr. (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Despite the fact that the Jaguars were playing from behind pretty much the entire game, Thomas finished third on the team in targets behind Travis Hunter (8-101-1 on 14 targets) and Parker Washington (4-52-0 on 10 targets). Thomas checked in and out of the lineup in the second half due to what seemed to be multiple nagging injuries, and he was eventually removed completely due to an apparent right shoulder issue late in the fourth quarter. The second-year wideout will have the Jaguars' Week 8 bye to get healthy, but through seven games he sports a disappointing 27-365-1 line on 55 targets.
</div>

### üü¢ Isiah Pacheco (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Pacheco finished as the Chiefs' leading rusher a week after scoring his first touchdown of the season. His 58 rushing yards also represented a new high-water mark through eight appearances, which also highlights his capped production as part of a backfield committee. Teammate Kareem Hunt still finished with the superior fantasy score after cashing in a pair of touchdowns in the lopsided win.  Pacheco did absorb a hard shot to his knee late in the contest, but he was seen moving freely on the sidelines after being checked out by the medical staff. Fantasy managers will want to monitor the rotation piece's status during the practice week ahead of a potential shootout against the Bills in Week 9.
</div>

### üü¢ Rashee Rice (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Rice stayed red-hot following his two-score debut in Week 7 with another trip to the end zone against the Commanders on Monday Night Football. In addition to his stellar receiving totals, the 25-year-old chipped in a pair of rare rushing attempts, matching the combined number of attempts from his first two seasons as a pro. Rice has accumulated 147 yards from scrimmage and three touchdowns on 21 touches while reclaiming the No. 1 receiver role for Kansas City in two starts since returning from a six-game suspension. Fantasy managers have to feel great about Rice's role and production heading into a potential shootout against Buffalo on Sunday.
</div>

### üü¢ Tyler Lockett (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Raiders waived wide receiver Justin Shorter to make room for Lockett on the 53-man roster. Lockett wasn't exactly productive across seven regular-season appearances with the Titans in 2025, recording just 10 catches for 70 yards on 20 targets, but he provides Las Vegas with veteran assistance behind top wideout Jakobi Meyers. Lockett will compete with third-year pro Tre Tucker and rookies Jack Bech and Dont'e Thornton for routes and targets with his new team, beginning Sunday at home against the Jaguars.
</div>

### üü¢ De'Von Achane (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Achane crossed the goal with a three-yard touchdown reception late in the first quarter to cap off a marathon 13-play drive that absorbed over eight minutes of clock. The speedy running back was generally contained on the ground while recording a long run of just 12 yards, and he also saw rookie backfield mate Ollie Gordon log a career-high 10 carries. Nevertheless, Achane's workload on the ground qualified as his second highest of the season, and he now has at least Sunday's yardage tally in three straight games, his best stretch of the season. Achane and the Dolphins will aim to carry over the momentum from their unexpectedly successful performance into a Week 9 home matchup against the Ravens on Thursday night.
</div>

### üü¢ Darius Slayton (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Slayton's stat line would have looked much better if his 68-yard fourth-quarter touchdown catch hadn't been called back due to a ticky-tack offensive pass interference call. Even so, Slayton still led the Giants in targets in his return from a two-game absence. With Malik Nabers (knee) done for the year and Wan'Dale Robinson rarely capable of contributing more than a few yards beyond the line of scrimmage, Slayton should continue to work as Jaxson Dart's top downfield target in Week 9 against the 49ers.
</div>

### üü¢ Wan'Dale Robinson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Robinson led the Giants in receiving yards on a quiet day for Jaxson Dart and the passing game. Darius Slayton (hamstring) returned from a two-game absence and led the team with five targets. Robinson should continue to operate underneath, while Slayton works as the team's top downfield wide receiver in Week 9 against the 49ers.
</div>

### üü¢ Aaron Rodgers (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Rodgers failed to lift Pittsburgh to its fifth win after coming up short against his former club on the national stage. The 41-year-old still produced a solid fantasy score after throwing multiple touchdowns for the fifth time in seven starts with the Steelers. With 16 touchdown passes on the year, Rodgers is on pace to finish with 30-plus touchdowns for the first time since 2022, his final season as a member of the Packers. The future Hall of Famer will have to overcome a tough matchup against the Colts next Sunday in order to get Pittsburgh back in the win column following consecutive losses.
</div>

### üü¢ Baker Mayfield (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Tampa Bay's defense (one touchdown), running game (one touchdown) and special teams (11 points) generated all of Tampa Bay's scoring in Sunday's one-sided victory. The unfavorable game script and Mayfield's first lost fumble of the season resulted in his worst fantasy score this campaign. The early MVP candidate's 152 passing yards also checked in as his lowest total through eight starts. Mayfield is still providing fantasy managers with 1,919 passing yards and 13 touchdowns (three turnovers) following the low-use outing, putting him on pace for a third consecutive 4,000-yard season. The 6-2 Buccaneers will enter a much-needed bye in Week 9, potentially giving Mayfield more of his weapons back when play resumes against the Patriots on Nov. 9.
</div>

### üü° Jayden Daniels (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
