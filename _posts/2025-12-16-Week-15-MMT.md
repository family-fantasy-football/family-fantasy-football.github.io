## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Khalil Shakir (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Shakir led the Bills in receptions, receiving yards and targets on an afternoon when Josh Allen threw for just 193 yards. The fourth-year pro eclipsed 50 receiving yards for only the second time in the last five games, as Buffalo's air attack continues to spread the ball around heavily to multiple pass catchers each week. Shakir will next set his sights on the Browns' injury-hampered secondary in a Week 16 road matchup next Sunday afternoon.
</div>

### 🟢 Harold Fannin Jr. (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Fannin accounted for nearly half of Cleveland's total targets, though his inefficient day reflected that of Shedeur Sanders. He was targeted in all depths of the field, but his deep opportunities were either intercepted or fell incomplete. While his results will likely remain inconsistent, it's clear that Fannin is Sanders' preferred target and that he will remain heavily involved in the offense.
</div>

### 🟢 Jake Ferguson (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Ferguson was surprisingly uninvolved in the Dallas offense for most of the game, with both of his catches going for short gains in the second quarter. His four targets were his fewest since Week 8, though this was the third time in his last seven games that Ferguson had 16 receiving yards or fewer. Ferguson will draw another tough matchup in Week 16 against the Chargers.
</div>

### 🟢 George Pickens (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Pickens was scrutinized throughout the week after a poor Week 14 performance, and he didn't fare any better in Sunday night's loss to the Vikings. His six targets were his fewest since Week 7, and his yardage was his lowest since Week 1. A Week 16 matchup against the Chargers isn't the ideal matchup for him to get back on track, though Pickens has managed to excel in tough matchups throughout the season.
</div>

### 🟢 Jahmyr Gibbs (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Gibbs was shut down by the Rams' ninth-ranked rush defense Sunday, resulting in a rare dud from the fantasy stud. Backfield mate David Montgomery (7-32-1) cashed in Detroit's lone rushing score in the loss, adding salt to the wounds of Gibbs' fantasy managers in Week 15. It was the third time this season that Gibbs was held to under 60 yards from scrimmage with no trips to the end zone. That said, he has still generated over 1,500 combined yards and 16 total touchdowns across 14 appearances in 2025. Look for Gibbs to get back on track in a home matchup against the Steelers next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟡 Woody Marks (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Ryans said Marks "got his ankle tweaked a little bit there early in the game," but the Texans opted to keep the rookie running back on the sideline to "make sure [he] is good as we continue to go into the week." Those comments seemingly bode well for Marks' chances of gaining clearance for Week 16, when Houston will face a plus matchup at home against the Raiders. That said, the next tangible update on Marks' health may not arrive until the team resumes practicing Wednesday. Nick Chubb (ribs) was inactive versus Arizona, so if Marks isn't able to return versus Las Vegas, Jawhar Jordan could get a chance to follow up on his 101-yard performance against Arizona.
</div>

### 🟢 Michael Pittman Jr. (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Philip Rivers' first start with the Colts in 2025 did not generate any fantasy stars from the receiving corps. Pittman did lead all Indianapolis wide receivers in targets and yardage, but that is not saying much in a game during which the offense was held to 120 passing yards. Pittman's value understandably dropped off following the news of QB Daniel Jones (Achilles) missing the rest of the season, and Rivers coming out of retirement may not be able to salvage it. The 27-year-old Pittman carries more value in deep and PPR formats for next Monday's tilt against the 49ers.
</div>

### 🔴 Bhayshul Tuten (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Doubtful<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> doubtful
</div>

### 🟢 Justin Herbert (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Herbert persevered through a pressure-filled afternoon that saw him sacked four times, navigating an aggressive Chiefs defense to help lead a comeback from a 13-3 deficit. The 2020 first-round pick put a dent in that margin just before the end of the first half, hitting rookie KeAndre Lambert-Smith from 16 yards out with five seconds remaining in the second quarter. Herbert was relatively quiet the rest of the way, but he helped lead Los Angeles to the final six points of the game for either side on a pair of third-quarter drives. Herbert will continue spearheading the Chargers' playoff quest in a marquee road showdown against the Cowboys next Sunday afternoon.
</div>

### 🟡 Davante Adams (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Adams dealt with a hamstring issue in advance of each of the Rams' past two games, but he left Sunday's win against the Lions early after aggravating the issue. Coach Sean McVay told Stu Jackson of the team's official site afterward that Adams' status was uncertain for Week 16 but that he "certainly wouldn't rule him out quite yet." Rapoport's report adds a new layer to Adams' status, but the veteran wide receiver may need to practice in some capacity this week in order to suit up Thursday.
</div>

### 🟢 T.J. Hockenson (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Hockenson surpassed 50 receiving yards for just the second time this season, finishing tied with Jordan Addison as the team's leading receiver. Justin Jefferson, meanwhile, finished with just two catches for 22 yards despite a team-high eight targets. Hockenson has drawn at least four targets in all but one of his last five appearances and continues to build chemistry with quarterback J.J. McCarthy, so he's trending up heading into a plus matchup against the Giants in Week 16.
</div>

### 🟢 J.J. McCarthy (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> McCarthy has been playing inspired ball since returning from his second layoff due to injury this season. The 22-year-old has generated six touchdowns (five passing) in the two games since returning from a concussion in Week 14, earning his club wins in both starts. His struggles getting top WR Justin Jefferson (2-22-0) involved on offense continued, but at least the young signal-caller has corrected his own inconsistent play from earlier in the schedule. Fantasy managers still struggling to find options at the quarterback position this late in the season should take a look at McCarthy in a soft matchup against the Giants next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Drake Maye (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Maye capped the opening drive with an eight-yard touchdown run, four plays after a drive-extending 30-yard pass to Kayshon Boutte, which hit the ground but wasn't challenged in time by Buffalo. The second-year quarterback added a seven-yard touchdown run late in the first quarter, but New England's offense didn't muster much after that outside of two long TreVeyon Henderson touchdown runs. Reigning MVP Josh Allen showed that a substantial gap remains between Maye and the NFL's top tier under center, as Allen threw three touchdown passes to lead the Bills' comeback from a 21-0 deficit and cut New England's lead atop the AFC East to one game. After feasting on an easy schedule for most of the campaign, Maye and the Patriots have a comparatively tougher stretch run, which will continue in Week 16 at Baltimore.
</div>

### 🟡 Alvin Kamara (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 Darius Slayton (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The 10 targets were a season high for Slayton, but the volume didn't lead to much production. The veteran wideout has a mediocre 30-460-1 line on 50 targets through 11 games on the season, giving him little fantasy appeal heading into a Week 16 meeting with the Vikings.
</div>

### 🟡 Ricky Pearsall (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Pearsall led San Francisco in receiving yards for the first time since returning from a knee injury he suffered back in Week 4. The 2024 first-round pick had amassed just five receptions for 20 yards over his last three appearances combined, so Sunday's strong showing may be a sign that the receiver is finally back to full strength. Pearsall will attempt to build off this performance when the 49ers visit the Colts for Monday Night Football in Week 16.
