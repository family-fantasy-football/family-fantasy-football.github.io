## üè• Player Report

### üü¢ Bam Knight (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The former Jet and Lion led the Cardinals in rushing yards as he got 17 touches to Michael Carter's nine, although neither back got into the end zone. The Cardinals get a Week 8 bye, but Knight will have at least one more game in a prominent backfield role in Week 9 against the Cowboys, with Trey Benson (knee) required to miss one more game before being eligible to come off IR. Over the three games Benson has missed so far, Knight has collected 142 scrimmage yards and two rushing TDs.
</div>

### üü¢ Marvin Harrison Jr. (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Harrison came out of a Week 6 loss in Indianapolis with a concussion that limited him at Wednesday's walkthrough and Thursday's practice, but his ability to handle every practice rep Friday followed by avoiding a Week 7 designation indicates he's been cleared by an independent neurologist. QB Kyler Murray (foot) is listed as questionable for Sunday's contest after being listed as limited all week, but Jacoby Brissett took all the visible reps with the first-team offense, suggesting the latter is more likely than the former to be tossing passes Harrison's way this weekend.
</div>

### üü¢ Dalton Kincaid (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Making his return from a one-game absence that predated the Week 7 bye, Kincaid made a splash on his one catch but otherwise was quiet. The third-year tight end had posted a 108-yard performance against the Patriots in Week 5 before sitting out Week 6, but he's now recorded 48 receiving yards or less in four of his other five games heading into a Week 9 clash with the Chiefs at home next Sunday afternoon.
</div>

### üü¢ James Cook III (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Cook's yardage total was unsurprisingly a career-best figure, one the fourth-year back accomplished with seven runs of 10-plus yards, including a 64-yard touchdown scamper just past the midway point of the second quarter. The talented back added a 21-yard scoring run with just under five minutes remaining in the third quarter, and he was able to take an early seat thanks to Buffalo's expansive lead. Cook has now eclipsed the 100-yard mark in four of the last six games following a 44-yard season opener against the Ravens, and he'll remain an elite option in all formats for a Week 9 home showdown against the Chiefs next Sunday afternoon.
</div>

### üü¢ J.K. Dobbins (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Dobbins took full advantage of Dallas' porous rush defense Sunday, rumbling for his second 100-plus yard rushing game this season. Fantasy managers will be annoyed to see rookie backup RJ Harvey gobble up three touchdowns on just eight total touches, as even just one of those scores going to the starter would have elevated his fantasy score from good to great. Touchdown vultures aside, Dobbins has been as steady as they come leading Denver's rushing attack in 2025, maintaining a stellar 5.0 per-carry average through eight starts.
</div>

### üü¢ Jared Goff (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Goff was able to lead his team to victory on Monday Night Football, but it came at the expense of his first multi-turnover game of the season. It also was the veteran signal-caller's third time scoring one touchdown or less this year. Goff has thrown 12 touchdowns to just one interception in his four other starts, so his whole body of work has been positive as Detroit enters its Week 8 bye. The 30-year-old should continue to be treated as a starting-level option in fantasy when the Lions host the Vikings on Sunday, Nov. 2.
</div>

### üü¢ Matthew Golden (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Green Bay activated another downfield threat in Christian Watson (knee) from the reserve/PUP list for his 2025 debut, but the absence of Dontayvion Wicks (calf) may have been a factor in both Watson and Golden seeing ample playing time in top-three roles at receiver. In Golden's case, he played 42 of Green Bay's 64 offensive snaps (66 percent), running a route on 28 of the 29 passing downs in which he was on the field. However, after delivering five receptions of 20-plus yards from Weeks 3 through 6, Golden was unable to provide a splash play for the second game in a row, with his average depth of target on the night settling at a season-low 1.3 yards. Better days should be ahead for the rookie first-round pick, but because Golden hasn't commanded heavy target volume in any game this season, he possesses a low floor that will make it difficult to include him in weekly fantasy lineups with much confidence.
</div>

### üü¢ Romeo Doubs (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Christian Watson (knee) made his season debut in Week 8, finishing with 85 receiving yards behind Tucker Kraft's monster receiving line (7-143-2). This left Dobbs finishing third in receiving for the Packers, although he finished second in team targets. While he didn't cash in any of Jordan Love's three touchdown passes, Doubs was able to find the end zone on a successful two-point conversion attempt to give managers a minor boost to his final fantasy score. Doubs should continue starting alongside Watson when Green Bay hosts Carolina next Sunday.
</div>

### üü¢ Alec Pierce (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Pierce followed up a season-high 98 receiving yards in Week 7 with his second-highest total through six starts in 2025. Michael Pittman stole the show with a 8-95-1 receiving line in the win, but Pierce still left his mark on the contest with a game-high reception of 50 yards. Pierce is averaging 64.3 receiving yards per game this season, but a lack of scoring (zero touchdowns) holds him back from standard-league relevance against the Steelers next Sunday.
</div>

### üü¢ Tyler Warren (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Warren couldn't extend his scoring streak to five games after not being on the receiving end of any of QB Daniel Jones' three touchdown strikes Sunday. The 23-year-old Warren didn't leave fantasy managers empty-handed on National Tight Ends Day after recording at least 50 receiving yards for the sixth time in eight starts this year. The impressive rookie is up to 492 receiving yards on 37 receptions with four combined touchdowns as the Colts prepare to face the Steelers in Week 9.
</div>

### üü¢ Travis Hunter (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The rookie two-way player hauled in his first career touchdown on a 34-yard toss from Trevor Lawrence with 9:06 remaining in the fourth quarter. Hunter set new personal bests in catches, yards and targets in the performance, and his volume increase came as Brian Thomas (shoulder) and Dyami Brown (leg) checked in and out of the lineup in the second half. The Jaguars will be on bye in Week 8, but if Thomas' injury proves to be serious, Hunter could be headed for significantly elevated volume in the second half.
</div>

### üü¢ Ashton Jeanty (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Raiders had arguably the worst offensive showing by a team this season, running only 30 offensive plays for 95 net yards. That didn't offer Jeanty any opportunity to get going, though he did still account for one of the team's more explosive plays with a 13-yard  catch and run late in the third quarter. It was a disappointing time for Jeanty to turn in the lowest yardage total of his career, as he had topped 100 yards from scrimmage in two of his last three contests.
</div>

### üî¥ Omarion Hampton (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Injured Reserve<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Hampton has been on injured reserve since Week 5 and doesn't appear to be close to a return to action. At the time of his placement on injured reserve, it was reported that Hampton would likely miss more than the minimum four games. With Hampton, Najee Harris (Achilles) and Hassan Haskins (hamstring) out Thursday against Minnesota, Kimani Vidal had a career game with a 23-117-1 rushing line. He should continue operating as the Chargers' RB1 in the immediate future.
</div>

### üü¢ Kayshon Boutte (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Mack Hollins surprisingly led the Patriots in catches, receiving yards and targets, but Boutte made a big splash with a 39-yard TD strike from Drake Maye, one of three passing touchdowns by the second-year QB in the third quarter. Boutte has gotten into the end zone in three straight games, posting a 10-223-4 line on 12 targets during that surge, and he'll look to keep rolling in Week 9 against the Falcons.
</div>

### üü¢ Jaxson Dart (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Dart tossed an 18-yard touchdown pass in the first quarter to Cam Skattebo, who later left the game due to a dislocated ankle. The Giants' offense didn't get much going after that, though Dart also had a would-be 68-yard touchdown pass to Darius Slayton in the fourth quarter nullified by a questionable offensive pass interference call. Dart tacked on a two-yard touchdown run late in the fourth quarter, giving the rookie first-round pick a rushing score in four of his first five starts. His rushing upside will keep Dart fantasy-relevant in Week 9 against the 49ers despite the Giants' depleted supporting cast on offense.
</div>

### üü¢ Pat Freiermuth (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Freiermuth racked up a season-high 111 receiving yards and two touchdowns during last week's loss to Cincinnati, but he had limited production in Week 8. He briefly exited the game due to injury in the third quarter, but it seems unlikely that the issue significantly impacted his performance given his speedy return. Freiermuth has had to compete with Jonnu Smith and Darnell Washington for work at tight end over the first half of the year, making all three players difficult to trust in fantasy.
</div>

### üü¢ Marcus Mariota (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Mariota put together another respectable stat line while filling in for Jayden Daniels (hamstring) for the third time this season, but he ultimately couldn't consistently move the Commanders down the field and short-circuited a pair of drives himself with interceptions. Mariota's first pick came on the opening possession on a pass that deflected off Deebo Samuel and landed in the hands of Mike Danna at the Chiefs' 22-yard line, while the second turnover unfolded at midfield with only 22 seconds remaining and the game well in hand for Kansas City. The veteran backup did connect with Terry McLaurin (quadriceps) from 11 yards out just before halftime for his one scoring toss, and Mariota would get the call against a second consecutive tough defense Week 9 if Daniels isn't healthy enough to suit up for a Sunday night home matchup against the Seahawks.
