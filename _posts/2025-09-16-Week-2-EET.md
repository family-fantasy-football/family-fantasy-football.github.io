## Player Report

#### Trey Benson (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Benson fell back to No. 2 in the RB pecking order Sunday after leading the team in rushing with 69 yards in Week 1. The Florida State product finished with eight fewer carries than starter James Conner (11-34-1), with the former making the bigger impact in the passing game. Conner is still the lead back and preferred fantasy option in Arizona, but Benson has carved out a nice role heading into next Sunday's tilt versus the 49ers.
#### Drake London (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** The Falcons relied on a run-heavy offense as they never trailed in the contest, limiting the production of all their pass catchers. Nevertheless, London led the team in yardage thanks to a long gain of 21 yards, though he also lost a fumble after an 18-yard gain early in the first quarter. He has only 104 yards on 19 targets through two games this season, and Atlanta may be able to rely heavily on their run game once again in Week 3 against Carolina.
#### Justice Hill (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Baltimore's run game was uncharacteristically shut down by the Browns on Sunday as Hill and Derrick Henry combined for 14 carries and 30 yards. Hill managed to contribute in the passing game with three grabs after being held to just one three-yard reception in the opener. His playing time remained in line with his Week 1 total as he played 22 snaps. His usage can vary week-to-week, but Hill's snap share sits in the 40 percent range.
#### Joshua Palmer (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Most of Palmer's production came on a 32-yard reception from Mitchell Trubisky, who came in for a pair of plays in the first quarter as Josh Allen tended to a nosebleed and again for mop-up duty down the stretch. Despite taking a step back from his five-catch, 61-yard Bills debut, Palmer led the team in receiving yards in Week 2, as Buffalo went with a much more run-heavy approach. Palmer has established himself as a top-three wide receiver on the team alongside Keon Coleman and Khalil Shakir heading into Thursday's home game against the Dolphins.
#### Courtland Sutton (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Bo Nix spread targets among the Denver pass catchers very evenly, with nine players targeted at least twice in the contest. While that was one factor in limiting Sutton's involvement, Troy Franklin also commanded nine targets to lead the team. It seems unlikely that Franklin will truly challenge Sutton for opportunities moving forward, but this was nevertheless a concerning performance for the latter.
#### Trevor Lawrence (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Lawrence had the Jaguars in position for a win until the Bengals managed to rally behind Jake Browning on a 15-play, 92-yard touchdown drive. Lawrence put together an impressive performance overall that included touchdown passes to Dyami Brown (nine yards), Bhayshul Tuten (eight yards) and Travis Etienne (11 yards), but he also short-circuited two Jacksonville drives in the first half with interceptions at the Bengals' three-yard line and his own 34-yard line. The two plays would help lead to a combined 10 points for Cincinnati, certainly key developments in such a close game. Lawrence also continued to struggle in his connection with No. 1 receiver Brian Thomas (four catches on 12 targets), and the duo will encounter a tough defensive matchup in a Week 3 home date against the Texans next Sunday.
#### Hollywood Brown (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Brown saw his target volume fall back down to earth following last week's 16-target, 10-catch outburst. The veteran wideout still led the Chiefs in receptions, with his five targets being usurped by only Travis Kelce's six in an overall lackluster passing performance Sunday. Brown could see his target share cut into if Xavier Worthy (shoulder) continues trending towards playing in Week 3. That said, Hollywood should stick in the starting lineup at least until Rashee Rice (suspension) returns in Week 7. Brown remains a plus PPR play when the Chiefs visit the Giants next Sunday.
#### Jakobi Meyers (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Meyers paced Las Vegas in targets, receptions and receiving yards despite finishing with a poor catch rate (50 percent). The 28-year-old has garnered double-digit targets in both appearances with new QB Geno Smith this season, cementing the wideout's spot atop the Raiders' depth chart. Meyers' predictable volume makes him a reliable starting option heading into Sunday's tilt against the Commanders, offering a notable boost in value for those in PPR formats.
#### Darren Waller (TE)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Waller, who has been out for the first two games of the season, had been deemed a non-participant in all of the Dolphins' practices leading up to Monday's estimate. Either way, the tight end's status for Thursday night's game against the Bills remains uncertain, with added context in that regard set to arrive via his participation level in Tuesday's session.
#### Aaron Jones Sr. (RB)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Jones made an early exit from Sunday's 22-6 loss to the Falcons due to a hamstring injury, but even before then he was in a relative timeshare with Jordan Mason. Overall, Jones tallied 23 yards on five carries and didn't haul in his only target on 20 offensive snaps, while Mason had nine carries for 30 yards and two catches (on three targets) for eight yards on 28 plays. If Jones ends up sitting out Week 3, Mason likely would take on the bulk of Minnesota's backfield reps, while Zavier Scott would be a candidate to mix in as well.
#### Rashid Shaheed (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The fourth-year wideout was on the other end of Spencer Rattler's second of three TD passes on the day, a three-yard strike in the third quarter. Shaheed has had a respectable start to the season in new head coach Kellen Moore's scheme, posting a 10-85-1 line on 14 targets through two games as the WR2 behind Chris Olave. Shaheed will look to build on this performance in Week 3 against the Seahawks.
#### Saquon Barkley (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Barkley set the tone on offense for Philadelphia by scoring the game's first touchdown in a rematch of Super Bowl LIX. The 28-year-old superstar went on to average 4.0 yards per tote while leading his club in yards from scrimmage (94). The recent trade for RB Tank Bigsby didn't affect Barkley's workload, as the only other rusher to record any carries was veteran backup AJ Dillon (3-19-0). Barkley will look to extend a modest two-game scoring streak to open the season when the Eagles host the Rams next Sunday.
#### Brock Purdy (QB)
**Injury Status:** Out <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** out
#### Tony Pollard (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Pollard was the only Titans running back to record a touch in Sunday's game and was fairly efficient given the team's poor offensive showing. His biggest gains came on a pair of 10-yard runs on back-to-back possessions just before halftime. Pollard should continue to see a very high workload so long as Tyjae Spears (ankle) remains sidelined, though his touchdown upside is limited until Cam Ward can get the offense moving more consistently.
#### Zach Ertz (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Ertz set the pace in receiving yards for the Commanders while finishing as the runner-up in receptions and also tying for second in targets. The veteran tight end also recorded his second TD of the season on an impressive 20-yard catch-and-run early in the fourth quarter, making it an all-around rewarding fantasy performance despite the disappointing team outcome. With 13 target through two games, Ertz looks to be just as in sync with Jayden Daniels as he was in the latter's rookie 2024 campaign, and the duo next will turn their sights to the Raiders defense in a Week 3 home matchup on Sunday, Sept. 21.
