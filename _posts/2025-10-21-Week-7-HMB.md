## üè• Player Report

### üü¢ Zay Flowers (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Flowers was targeted heavily by the combination of Cooper Rush and Tyler Huntley, with no other Baltimore pass catcher earning more than six targets. He had long gains of 18 and 10 yards, though the latter was undone when he fumbled on the same play. Flowers has been mediocre from a fantasy perspective in the absence of Lamar Jackson (hamstring) despite consistent volume in the offense. However, he should be in line for more explosive performances with Jackson expected back in Week 8 following Baltimore's bye.
</div>

### üü¢ Derrick Henry (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Ravens' offensive game plan was to feed Henry as much as possible, limiting the need for Cooper Rush to take to the air. That was effective in the first half, as Henry delivered 18 carries for 90 yards while Baltimore also controlled time of possession. Game script ultimately got away from the team, but this was a needed performance from Henry, both in terms of volume and efficiency. He recorded three rushes of more than 10 yards to top 50 yards for the first time since Week 1. Henry's 25 touches were also his most of the campaign, and he should benefit from the expected return of Lamar Jackson (hamstring) in Week 8, following the team's bye.
</div>

### üü¢ Josh Allen (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Allen's final line tells the tale of a difficult night against a well-rested and aggressive Falcons defense fueled by its home crowd. Despite his signature mobility, Allen was sacked four times, and he also tossed multiple interceptions for the first time this season, including a game-sealing pick at Atlanta's 7-yard line with 51 seconds remaining. The reigning NFL MVP's yardage total also was his second lowest of the season, and the fact he went into the contest without Dalton Kincaid (oblique) and Curtis Samuel (neck/ribs) before also losing Joshua Palmer to an ankle injury in the first half certainly didn't help Allen's cause. Buffalo now gets a much-needed bye following back-to-back losses before returning to action against the Panthers in Carolina on Sunday, Oct. 26.
</div>

### üü¢ Sam LaPorta (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> LaPorta came out of Monday's primetime matchup with his worst receiving line of the season. The 24-year-old's targets and yardage both represented new lows in seven starts this year. LaPorta's dud comes on the heels of the tight end's best two fantasy outings in which he scored a touchdown apiece, so managers should hang tight through the Lions' upcoming bye week. Detroit resumes play against Minnesota on Nov. 2 in Week 9.
</div>

### üü¢ Amon-Ra St. Brown (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> St. Brown found his way back into the end zone after being held scoreless in Detroit's last two contests. The superstar wideout continued dominating QB Jared Goff's target share, finishing the primetime win with seven more targets than any other Lions receiver. St. Brown's mini scoring slump hasn't stopped him from posting a WR1 numbers (50-538-7) heading into his team's bye week. Fantasy managers will have to fill the Sun God's roster spot Week 8 until Detroit returns to action against Minnesota on Sunday, Nov. 2.
</div>

### üü¢ Tucker Kraft (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> While the third-year tight end wasn't exactly efficient with his team-high target volume, Kraft did come up big when it counted, hauling in a seven-yard TD from Jordan Love early in the fourth quarter. Kraft has four touchdowns in six games to begin the season, posting a 23-326-4 line on 32 targets, and he figures to be productive again in Week 8 against a Steelers defense that's been vulnerable to TEs this season.
</div>

### üü¢ Jordan Love (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Packers' offense slept through the first half, managing only two field goals, but Love was able to get thing going after halftime as the team rallied from a 13-6 deficit with three second-half TDs, including a seven-yard TD pass to Tucker Kraft. Love has had an efficient start to the season, posting a 10:2 TD:INT through six games, but he's thrown a single touchdown in three of his last four starts. He may need to be more productive in Week 8 as the Packers have a showdown with Aaron Rodgers and his new club, the Steelers.
</div>

### üü¢ JuJu Smith-Schuster (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Rashee Rice made his season debut and immediately dominated opportunity, commanding 10 targets while the next closest Chief had five. Smith-Schuster was in the mix with the rest of Kansas City's pass catchers and set up the team's third touchdown of the day with long gains of 19 and 12 yards. While Smith-Schuster is a key part of the team's offense, he has topped 50 receiving yards only three times in seven games this season and is likely to be less involved moving forward due to the return of Rice.
</div>

### üü¢ Kareem Hunt (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Hunt served strictly in a relief role to Isiah Pacheco for much of the first half, logging four carries to Pacheco's eight. Hunt also suffered an apparent leg or ankle injury on a touchdown by Rashee Rice midway through the first quarter. He was able to retake the field, but the Chiefs ultimately may have opted to lessen his workload as a precaution in the blowout game script.
</div>

### üü¢ Tre Tucker (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Tucker benefited from the absence of Jakobi Meyers (knee) and Brock Bowers (knee), but the performance of the Raiders' offense muted his stat line. Tucker led the team in every receiving stat, though three of his catches went for five yards or fewer.  The Raiders will now head into a Week 8 bye, which will likely allow both Meyers and Bowers to get healthy and push Tucker down in priority for targets in the offense when the team retakes the field  against the Jaguars in Week 9.
</div>

### üü¢ Keenan Allen (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The targets, catches and yards were all season highs for the veteran wideout, who was Justin Herbert's most reliable option in the second half as the Chargers tried to mount a comeback from a 23-3 halftime deficit. Allen snapped a three-game scoring drought with the performance, and he'll carry a 44-435-4 line on 65 targets through seven contests into a Week 8 clash with a Vikings secondary that just surrendered a combined 13-304-3 line to A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith.
</div>

### üü¢ Blake Corum (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Corum was able to work back from an ankle injury that limited him during the practice week in order to suit up for Sunday's overseas tilt in London. The 24-year-old wound up handling a season-high 12 carries, matching starter Kyren Williams (12-54-0) in a game dominated by Los Angeles' passing attack. It is important to note that half of Corum's carries came late in the fourth quarter with the game well out of reach, so this was unlikely a changing of the guard in the Rams' backfield. The 2024 third-round pick was averaging 4.8 rushing attempts per game prior to the Week 7 outburst, so managers should keep expectations in check coming out of the Rams' upcoming bye week.
</div>

### üü¢ Kenneth Gainwell (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Gainwell was back to a strict complementary role in Thursday night's game, as Jaylen Warren put together his best performance of the season with a 127-yard tally on the ground. Gainwell's carry and rushing yardage totals were both season lows, but the veteran back was able to make some solid contributions in his capacity as a returner. Gainwell should remain in a similar role when the Packers come to Pittsburgh for a Sunday night Week 8 showdown on Oct. 26.
</div>

### üü¢ Sterling Shepard (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Shepard tied Cade Otton for the team lead in receptions with a figure that also served as the veteran receiver's season high, but he averaged minuscule 3.6 yards per catch. The Lions' extremely short-handed secondary significantly overperformed expectations against a Buccaneers offense that had been running hot, and Shepard therefore posted his third sub-30-yard tally of the season. Nevertheless, considering Mike Evans will be out for a significant amount of time due to the broken collarbone he suffered Monday night -- and Chris Godwin has now missed consecutive games with a fibula injury -- Shepard figures to remain in an expanded role for the foreseeable future.
</div>

### üü¢ Cam Ward (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Ward turned in the most efficient game of his career, averaging 7.5 yards per attempt. He also showed rapport with fellow rookie Chimere Dike, connecting on a 38-yard score late in the first quarter on a deep ball to the left corner of the end zone -- one of his four completions of at least 15 yards. There were still plenty of problems with the performance, including a pair of turnovers and five sacks, highlighting Ward's inconsistency.
</div>

### üü¢ Jacory Croskey-Merritt (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Croskey-Merritt couldn't find any running lanes against one of the worst rushing defenses in the league Sunday. The seventh-round rookie still led Washington's backfield in touches, but he ceded a short rushing touchdown to backup Chris Rodriguez (3-12-1). It is unclear whether Jayden Daniels (hamstring) or Marcus Mariota will be under center for next Monday's tilt against the Chiefs, but Croskey-Merritt figures to continue spearheading the Commanders' backfield rotation in Week 8.
