## üè• Player Report

### üü° Drake London (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Morris called both London and quarterback Michael Penix (knee) day-to-day in the wake of both players having missed Atlanta's 34-10 loss to the Dolphins in Week 8. Veteran backup quarterback Kirk Cousins looked ill-prepared to command the Falcons offense without London on the field, finishing with just 173 passing yards with no touchdowns or interceptions despite facing off against a deeply flawed Miami secondary. Whether it ends up being Penix or Cousins under center on the road against New England on Sunday, it will bode well for Atlanta's aerial attack if London is able to retake the field alongside Darnell Mooney and TE Kyle Pitts. The star wideout was a late addition to the Week 8 injury report.
</div>

### üü¢ Justice Hill (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Baltimore leaned on Derrick Henry as the primary running back Sunday, and even when Hill was in, he wasn't a featured part of the offense. Hill's usage is volatile week-to-week and depends on game script where Baltimore needs to utilize his blitz pickup and pass-catching skills. Another looming threat to Hill's usage was the reintroduction of Keaton Mitchell to the backfield. Mitchell played just seven snaps but had a strong usage rate with four carries for 43 yards. Hill's role won't be deleted from the offense because he offers elements that Henry and Mitchell do not, but his snap counts could take a hit going forward if Mitchell continues to shine.
</div>

### üü° Joshua Palmer (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### üü¢ Courtland Sutton (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Sutton took a back seat to Denver's younger receiving options Sunday, watching Troy Franklin, Pat Bryant and RJ Harvey collect all of Bo Nix's touchdown passes in the blowout win. The veteran starter still produced adequate receiving totals despite failing to reach the end zone, duplicating the 67.0 yards/game average he posted over his previous seven appearances. Fantasy managers are hoping Sutton can return to the end zone against the Texans in Week 9 after he scored all three of his touchdowns in Denver's first four games of the season.
</div>

### üü¢ Trevor Lawrence (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Jaguars were staring at a 21-0 deficit at halftime, so Lawrence was forced to put the ball in the air most of the second half. The volume led to a season high in passing yards for the fifth-year QB, as well as Travis Hunter's first career TD reception, but it also led to Lawrence being sacked seven times. He'll take a mediocre 9:5 TD:INT through seven games into Jacksonville's Week 8 bye.
</div>

### üü¢ Hollywood Brown (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Brown made an early impact in the game, hauling in an eight-yard touchdown to put the Chiefs up 14-0. He was a non-factor after that, mixing in for similar target volume with all of the Chiefs' pass catchers except Rashee Rice. Brown could pop up for decent performances throughout the rest of the season, but the return of Rice will make it difficult for Brown to retain the consistent involvement in the offense he enjoyed in the early part of the campaign.
</div>

### üü° Jakobi Meyers (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### üü¢ Aaron Jones Sr. (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jones made his return from a four-game absence and logged one more carry than backfield mate Jordan Mason, but game script significantly limited Minnesota's ability to run a balanced offense. Jones' truncated opportunities Thursday aside, the veteran back is likely to function as the lead back -- even if not by a significant margin -- over Mason moving forward, but another tough matchup awaits in Week 9 on Sunday, Nov. 2 in the form of a trip to the Motor City to face the Lions.
</div>

### üü¢ Rashid Shaheed (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Shaheed's 12 targets and nine receptions crushed his previous highs of nine and six respectively, but he failed to sniff the 114 yards he posted in Week 5. The fourth-year starter has provided a nice floor for those in deeper formats, recording at least four receptions in each of his eight appearances in 2025. Shaheed's overall line of 39-431-2 looks solid on paper, but over half of his production (including both of his touchdowns) have come in three games. Expect Shaheed to continue serving as one of either Spencer Rattler's or Tyler Shough's top targets against the Rams next Sunday.
</div>

### üü° Saquon Barkley (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> When Barkley exited late in the third quarter after a 28-yard run with what eventually was termed a groin injury, the Eagles were up 24-13 on the Giants and proceeded to extend the lead to 18 points by the end of that drive. He added afterward that he likely could have remained in the contest if the score was ever in doubt down the stretch, per Tim McManus of ESPN.com. The Eagles have a Week 9 bye on tap, so he'll have time to recuperate before the Week 10 showdown against the Packers after finishing Week 8 with 18 touches for 174 yards from scrimmage and two total TDs. It should be noted that reserve RB Tank Bigsby reeled off 104 yards on nine rushes by game's end, indicating he's currently the next player up if Barkley needs to miss any time.
</div>

### üü° Brock Purdy (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> One week removed from Shanahan saying it was a "stretch" for Purdy to play this past Sunday in Houston, the coach was more tepid in his phrasing, indicating that the 49ers are keeping the door open this week for the fourth-year pro to see his first game action since Week 4. Shanahan also told David Lombardi of SFStandard.com that fill-in QB Mac Jones emerged from Week 8 action with a knee contusion and is "day-to-day." As a result, the situation under center in San Francisco bears watching as the week continues to get a sense of if Purdy will resume starting duties Week 9.
</div>

### üî¥ George Kittle (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Kittle commemorated the National Tight End Day quasi-holiday he helped bring about by recording his second touchdown of the season on a 17-yard grab just before halftime. Kittle had been shut out altogether in his Week 7 return from a hamstring injury, so Sunday's production was a particularly welcome sight for fantasy managers and included a new season-high yardage total for the veteran tight end. Kittle draws another favorable matchup irrespective of who his quarterback is when the 49ers face the Giants on the road in Week 9.
</div>

### üü¢ Tony Pollard (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Pollard finished with a team-high 11 carries in Sunday's blowout loss, but it was backup Tyjae Spears (9-59-1) who produced the superior fantasy score. The 28-year-old Pollard has seen his production dip in recent weeks, tallying just 96 rushing yards with no touchdowns over his last three starts. The untimely dip in production has come alongside Spears' return from injury in Week 5, with a less-than-appealing timeshare developing in Tennessee's backfield. Pollard still retains deep-league value so long as he is starting, but expectations should be kept in check for larger formats against the Chargers next Sunday.
</div>

### üü¢ Zach Ertz (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Ertz's yardage total was his lowest for any game this season where he recorded a catch, even as he hit the six-target threshold for the third consecutive game. The veteran tight end's late first-quarter grab was also the subject of some controversy, as Ertz appeared to gain the necessary six yards for a first down on a fourth-down play before a virtual measurement reduced the gain to five yards, leading to a turnover on downs. Ertz has eclipsed 43 receiving yards just once this season, leaving him with muted fantasy prospects heading into a Week 9 home matchup against the Seahawks on Sunday night.
