## Player Report

#### Rico Dowdle (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Chuba Hubbard (calf) returned to practice Wednesday as a limited participant after Dowdle ran for 389 yards over the past two weeks. Hubbard was excellent last season and didn't do anything this September to warrant a benching, but the massive extent of Dowdle's recent production nonetheless creates questions about what the Carolina backfield will look like moving forward. The split for Week 7 won't necessarily be the split for the rest of the season, of course, and there may be room for multiple RBs to put up solid numbers against a subpar Jets defense.
#### Bryce Young (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Young's yardage total was far from scintillating, but the third-year signal-caller kept his team competitive throughout a back-and-forth affair against Dak Prescott and his high-powered offense. Young did his part with a trio of touchdown tosses, two which went to rookie wideout Tetairoa McMillan from 19 and two yards out, respectively. Young also connected with Rico Dowdle for a 36-yard strike early in the third quarter, tying Young's single-game high for TD passes this season. The 2023 first overall pick has now been under 200 passing yards in four consecutive contests, but he'll carry the momentum of a season-best 68.0 percent completion rate into a Week 7 road matchup against the Jets.
#### Chase Brown (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Brown finally showed some efficiency on the ground thanks primarily to a 13-yard run shortly before halftime. However, his day was defined by a shift in touch allocation in the Cincinnati backfield, with Samaje Perine earning eight total touches to Brown's 11. Game script may have dictated that late in the contest, but Perine drew the Bengals' first carry and recorded only two of his touches when the team was in a hopeless situation on the scoreboard. There's no obvious candidate to fully displace Brown in the Cincinnati backfield,  but this was the team's first signal that it may be growing weary of his lack of efficiency.
#### Jerry Jeudy (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Jeudy is listed on Cleveland's injury report for the first time this year, though the fact that he was able to practice on at least a limited basis provides reason for optimism that he'll be able to gain clearance for Sunday's matchup against the Dolphins. Still, Jeudy has struggled notably with efficiency across two appearances with quarterback Dillon Gabriel under center, having totaled seven grabs for 58 yards (on 18 targets) in that span. Even if he's able to resume practicing in full and avoid an injury designation entirely for Week 7, fantasy managers may be motivated to pursue an option at the wide receiver position that has demonstrated greater upside. Across six regular-season appearances so far Jeudy has yet to score a touchdown, and he hasn't surpassed 50 receiving yards since Week 2.
#### CeeDee Lamb (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** As expected, Lamb had his reps capped while practicing for the first time since he suffered a left high-ankle sprain in the Cowboys' Week 3 loss at Chicago. Fellow Cowboys wide receiver KaVontae Turpin (foot) also returned to practice Wednesday, potentially pushing Jalen Tolbert and Ryan Flournoy further down the depth chart. It isn't clear at this point if the Cowboys expect Lamb and/or Turpin to be ready to play in Sunday's home game against the Commanders.
#### Dak Prescott (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Prescott continued his excellent season, throwing for three or more touchdowns in his third straight game while also surpassing 250 passing yards for the fourth time in six contests on the campaign. He showed an ongoing strong connection with George Pickens, connecting with him for three gains of more than 30 yards, including scores from 45 and 34 yards away. Prescott's outlook could improve further in Week 7 due to the potential return of CeeDee Lamb (ankle), though Prescott has proven plenty capable of producing without one of his star pass catchers.
#### RJ Harvey (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Harvey once again operated as the clear No. 2 back behind J.K. Dobbins, who significantly outpaced the rookie by 12 carries. However, Harvey continued to enjoy a solid pass-catching role, extending his streak of games with at least three receptions to four contests. Nevertheless, Harvey's persistently modest role will continue to render him as a deep-league-only option and large-field tournament play in DFS formats unless Dobbins sustains an injury.
#### Xavier Worthy (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Worthy endured another limited practice week in order to suit up for the Chiefs on Sunday. The speedy wideout has missed two-plus games of action due to injury, but he has now started three consecutive games as his health gradually returns to full strength. Worthy made his first trip to the end zone this season in the primetime win, salvaging what would have been an otherwise disappointing night at the office. The 2024 first-round selection averaged 86.0 combined yards from scrimmage over his first two games back from injury, so Sunday's low usage shouldn't be of concern. The biggest threat to Worthy's target share in Week 7 is the scheduled return of suspended WR Rashee Rice, who is likely to reclaim his role as Kansas City's top wideout against Las Vegas next Sunday.
#### Patrick Mahomes (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** It was a masterful performance from Mahomes on the national stage as he methodically dismantled Detroit's defense to the tune of a 132.2 passer rating. The 29-year-old posted his second four-touchdown game over his last three starts, quickly putting his slow start to the campaign in the rearview mirror. His fourth rushing score this season also tied the regular-season high he set back in 2022. A red-hot Mahomes will set his sights on a division foe when the Chiefs host the Raiders next Sunday.
#### Darren Waller (TE)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Waller continues to have his practice reps capped due to a load management plan, though his gameday workload has now increased in three consecutive weeks. The veteran tight end handled a season-high 69 percent of offensive snaps during Miami's loss to the Chargers in Week 6, securing two of three targets for 12 yards and a touchdown. Waller has scored in all three of his appearances with the Dolphins this season. He'll face a challenge to keep up that streak on the road against the Browns' vaunted defense on Sunday, though if Cleveland's pass rush forces Tua Tagovailoa to rely heavily on short-area passes, it could result in increased target volume for Waller.
#### Stefon Diggs (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Diggs was on the field for 59 percent of the Patriots' snaps on offense in this past Sunday's 25-19 win over the Saints, catching all three of his targets for 28 yards, which represented a dip in production for him after back-to-back 100-plus yard efforts in Weeks 4 and 5. So far there's nothing to suggest that Diggs' availability for this weekend's game against the Titans is in any danger, but his status should be monitored nonetheless given his 'limited' listing Wednesday.
#### TreVeyon Henderson (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The results were meager, but Henderson still out-gained Rhamondre Stevenson by 18 scrimmage yards, although he finished one rushing yard behind quarterback Drake Maye for the team lead. Henderson has yet to reach even 40 rushing yards or 60 scrimmage yards in a game this season, and the rookie will likely remain stuck in a timeshare with Stevenson heading into a Week 7 clash with the Titans.
#### Mason Taylor (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Just one week after posting a career-best 9-67-0 line on 12 targets, Taylor nearly pulled a complete disappearing act in Sunday's low-scoring loss. However, the rookie tight end was hardly the only Jets pass catcher to experience a forgettable afternoon, considering Justin Fields threw for just 45 yards and was sacked nine times. The Week 7 outlook for the entire offense is much brighter, however, as New York welcomes in the Panthers to MetLife Stadium for a Week 7 matchup next Sunday.
#### Brandon Aiyuk (WR)
**Injury Status:** Out <br>
**Lineup Slot:** IR <br>
**Details:** Aiyuk remains in recovery mode from the ACL and MCL tears that he suffered in his right knee Week 7 of last season, instead residing on the reserve/PUP list to this point in the campaign. Per David Lombardi of SFStandard.com, Shanahan added, "I always look around Week 10, but I'm not putting an exact date on it." As of Week 6, Aiyuk's only notable on-field work occurred in mid-September, when he was seen running while fellow 49ers wide receivers worked in individual drills, per Wagoner.
#### Bucky Irving (RB)
**Injury Status:** Doubtful <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Buccaneers head coach Todd Bowles suggested earlier in the week that Irving wasn't on track to play this Monday against the Lions, and the running back's continued absence from practice due to a shoulder subluxation and a left foot sprain supports that sentiment. Assuming Irving is officially ruled out for the Week 7 contest following Saturday's practice, Rachaad White would be headed for a third consecutive turn as the Buccaneers' lead back Monday.
#### Elic Ayomanor (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Ayomanor produced his third underwhelming performance in a row as the Titans returned to their losing ways in 2025. The lack of production from the rookie is especially concerning considering that No. 1 wideout Calvin Ridley (hamstring) left the contest early and did not return. Van Jefferson (4-75-0) wound up taking advantage instead and finished as Tennessee's leading receiver. That said, if Ridley is forced to miss next Sunday's tilt against the Patriots, Ayomanor may have a prime opportunity to return to the form that made him a hot pickup early in the campaign.
