## Player Report

#### Bryce Young (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Young's yardage total was far from scintillating, but the third-year signal-caller kept his team competitive throughout a back-and-forth affair against Dak Prescott and his high-powered offense. Young did his part with a trio of touchdown tosses, two which went to rookie wideout Tetairoa McMillan from 19 and two yards out, respectively. Young also connected with Rico Dowdle for a 36-yard strike early in the third quarter, tying Young's single-game high for TD passes this season. The 2023 first overall pick has now been under 200 passing yards in four consecutive contests, but he'll carry the momentum of a season-best 68.0 percent completion rate into a Week 7 road matchup against the Jets.
#### Rico Dowdle (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** One week after delivering a career-best 206-yard effort against the Dolphins, Dowdle was blessed with a second straight matchup against a porous defense. In Week 6, that unit happened to be comprised of plenty of his former Cowboys teammates, and Dowdle parlayed the additional incentive into another spectacular afternoon. While he came just short of hitting the 200-yard mark on the ground for the second straight contest, the surging veteran was able to shine as a pass catcher while compiling a team-high receiving yardage total and scoring his first receiving TD of the season on a 36-yard grab to close out the opening possession of the second half. Given Dowdle's production over the last two games, it appears highly unlikely Chuba Hubbard (calf) will be able to reclaim anything close to the snap share he previously enjoyed as the No. 1 back, and the latter doesn't appear likely to be available for a Week 7 road matchup against the Jets next Sunday anyhow.
#### Chase Brown (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Brown finally showed some efficiency on the ground thanks primarily to a 13-yard run shortly before halftime. However, his day was defined by a shift in touch allocation in the Cincinnati backfield, with Samaje Perine earning eight total touches to Brown's 11. Game script may have dictated that late in the contest, but Perine drew the Bengals' first carry and recorded only two of his touches when the team was in a hopeless situation on the scoreboard. There's no obvious candidate to fully displace Brown in the Cincinnati backfield,  but this was the team's first signal that it may be growing weary of his lack of efficiency.
#### Jerry Jeudy (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Jeudy bounced back from a volume perspective in Dillon Gabriel's second career start, as he led the team in targets in Sunday's loss. However, the good news ended there, as Jeudy managed an abysmal 3.3 yards per target with a long reception of only 12 yards. Things haven't gone well between Gabriel and Jeudy early on, as Jeudy has only seven catches for 58 yards on 18 targets through Gabriel's first two starts.
#### CeeDee Lamb (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** questionable
#### Dak Prescott (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Prescott continued his excellent season, throwing for three or more touchdowns in his third straight game while also surpassing 250 passing yards for the fourth time in six contests on the campaign. He showed an ongoing strong connection with George Pickens, connecting with him for three gains of more than 30 yards, including scores from 45 and 34 yards away. Prescott's outlook could improve further in Week 7 due to the potential return of CeeDee Lamb (ankle), though Prescott has proven plenty capable of producing without one of his star pass catchers.
#### RJ Harvey (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Harvey once again operated as the clear No. 2 back behind J.K. Dobbins, who significantly outpaced the rookie by 12 carries. However, Harvey continued to enjoy a solid pass-catching role, extending his streak of games with at least three receptions to four contests. Nevertheless, Harvey's persistently modest role will continue to render him as a deep-league-only option and large-field tournament play in DFS formats unless Dobbins sustains an injury.
#### Xavier Worthy (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Worthy endured another limited practice week in order to suit up for the Chiefs on Sunday. The speedy wideout has missed two-plus games of action due to injury, but he has now started three consecutive games as his health gradually returns to full strength. Worthy made his first trip to the end zone this season in the primetime win, salvaging what would have been an otherwise disappointing night at the office. The 2024 first-round selection averaged 86.0 combined yards from scrimmage over his first two games back from injury, so Sunday's low usage shouldn't be of concern. The biggest threat to Worthy's target share in Week 7 is the scheduled return of suspended WR Rashee Rice, who is likely to reclaim his role as Kansas City's top wideout against Las Vegas next Sunday.
#### Patrick Mahomes (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** It was a masterful performance from Mahomes on the national stage as he methodically dismantled Detroit's defense to the tune of a 132.2 passer rating. The 29-year-old posted his second four-touchdown game over his last three starts, quickly putting his slow start to the campaign in the rearview mirror. His fourth rushing score this season also tied the regular-season high he set back in 2022. A red-hot Mahomes will set his sights on a division foe when the Chiefs host the Raiders next Sunday.
#### Darren Waller (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Waller was having a surprisingly forgettable day until the final minute of the contest, when he recorded a seven-yard touchdown grab in the right corner of the end zone with 46 seconds remaining to cap off a 13-play drive and erase a 26-20 deficit. The veteran tight end, who'd come into the day with an 8-105-3 receiving line over his first two games, would have therefore been the hero had Justin Herbert not driven the Chargers down for a game-winning field goal. Waller has now turned a whopping 40.0 percent of his 10 catches to date into touchdowns, and while regression is inevitable, he could be busy in a Week 7 road matchup against a Browns defense that could force the struggling Tua Tagovailoa to get the ball out quickly.
#### Stefon Diggs (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** The veteran wideout wasn't able to follow up on his revenge game against the Bills last week, as Drake Maye instead looked for Kayshon Boutte (5-93-2 on five targets) and DeMario Douglas (3-71-1 on four targets) with his downfield throws Sunday. Diggs has a respectable 32 catches for 387 yards on 37 targets through six games, but he's still looking for his first TD of 2025. Diggs will try to hit paydirt in Week 7 against the Titans.
#### TreVeyon Henderson (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The results were meager, but Henderson still out-gained Rhamondre Stevenson by 18 scrimmage yards, although he finished one rushing yard behind quarterback Drake Maye for the team lead. Henderson has yet to reach even 40 rushing yards or 60 scrimmage yards in a game this season, and the rookie will likely remain stuck in a timeshare with Stevenson heading into a Week 7 clash with the Titans.
#### Tyrone Tracy Jr. (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Tracy returned from a two-game absence due to a shoulder injury but ceded the vast majority of backfield opportunities to Cam Skattebo, who turned 21 touches into 110 yards from scrimmage and three touchdowns. Tracy was on the field for 21 offensive snaps compared to only four for Devin Singletary, but Skattebo led the backfield with 49 snaps in addition to getting the lion's share of rushing opportunities. With Skattebo finding success in a workhorse role, Tracy likely will be relegated to a change-of-pace role moving forward.
#### Mason Taylor (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Just one week after posting a career-best 9-67-0 line on 12 targets, Taylor nearly pulled a complete disappearing act in Sunday's low-scoring loss. However, the rookie tight end was hardly the only Jets pass catcher to experience a forgettable afternoon, considering Justin Fields threw for just 45 yards and was sacked nine times. The Week 7 outlook for the entire offense is much brighter, however, as New York welcomes in the Panthers to MetLife Stadium for a Week 7 matchup next Sunday.
#### Brandon Aiyuk (WR)
**Injury Status:** Out <br>
**Lineup Slot:** IR <br>
**Details:** Aiyuk remains in recovery mode from the ACL and MCL tears that he suffered in his right knee Week 7 of last season, instead residing on the reserve/PUP list to this point in the campaign. Per David Lombardi of SFStandard.com, Shanahan added, "I always look around Week 10, but I'm not putting an exact date on it." As of Week 6, Aiyuk's only notable on-field work occurred in mid-September, when he was seen running while fellow 49ers wide receivers worked in individual drills, per Wagoner.
#### Bucky Irving (RB)
**Injury Status:** Doubtful <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** doubtful
