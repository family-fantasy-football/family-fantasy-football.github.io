## Player Report

#### Trey Benson (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Benson operated as the unquestioned lead back in the Cardinals' first game without James Conner (IR, foot), but he finished with two fewer carries than in Sunday's Week 3 loss to the 49ers. Benson did record a season high in receptions and outpaced No. 2 back Emari Demercado by six carries, but game script conspired to afford him almost as much pass-catching work as rushing volume. Benson should have a better opportunity to handle a larger workload during a Week 5 home matchup against an ineffective Titans defense on Sunday, Oct. 5.
#### Drake London (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The fourth-year wideout didn't reach 60 receiving yards or find the end zone in the first three weeks of the season, but London broke out in Week 4, highlighting his performance with a five-yard TD reception from Michael Penix in the first quarter. London led the Falcons in targets -- no one else got more than five -- as well as catches and receiving yards, and he remains the unquestioned top option in the team's passing game headed into a Week 5 bye, ahead of a tough Week 6 battle against the Bills.
#### Justice Hill (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Hill opened and closed the scoring Sunday. He punched in an 11-yard touchdown grab to cap off the Ravens' first drive, then finished things off with a 71-yard touchdown run to bring the Ravens within 17 points with under two minutes to go. In between, Hill added a few short carries and receptions as the Ravens' offense largely floundered. It was noteworthy that Hill out-snapped Derrick Henry 32 to 21, but the Ravens trailed from the second quarter onward. The Ravens host the Texans in Week 5.
#### Joshua Palmer (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Palmer's playing time has dwindled in recent weeks. After playing over 62 percent of the offensive snaps in Week 1 against the Ravens, Palmer's workload has dipped in each game since, landing at just 25 percent against New Orleans. In a Buffalo offense that likes to cycle through its receivers and tight ends throughout the course of a game, Palmer holds minimal fantasy value unless injuries crop up ahead of him on the depth chart.
#### Courtland Sutton (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Sutton stayed hot with his second trip to the end zone in as many weeks while pacing the Broncos in receiving yards on Monday Night Football. The one-catch dud in Week 2 is proving to be an anomaly after the veteran wideout posted WR1 numbers in his three other starts this year. Expect Sutton to continue operating as QB Bo Nix's favorite target in a road matchup against the Eagles on Sunday.
#### Trevor Lawrence (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Lawrence played the role of game manager Sunday, protecting the football with safe, short throws en route to Jacksonville's third win of the season. It was still a lackluster showing from a fantasy perspective after the fifth-year pro failed to score multiple touchdowns for the third time in four starts this year. Lawrence has the Jaguars atop the AFC South, but his play does not inspire much optimism in fantasy circles heading into a tough matchup against Kansas City next Monday.
#### Hollywood Brown (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Brown maintained a key role in the Kansas City offense even with the return of Xavier Worthy, as he was one of four pass catchers with at least five targets. He made an 18-yard grab early in the second quarter to set up a field goal, and he added a 15-yard touchdown catch early in the fourth quarter. Since an explosive Week 1 performance, Brown has not reached 50 receiving yards in a game, though he has consistently earned at least five targets.
#### Jakobi Meyers (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Meyers wound up leading the Raiders in targets, but the end result was a season low in receiving yards. The veteran wideout's yardage total has decreased on a weekly basis, but he was able to buck a similar trend in targets with Sunday's seven looks from Geno Smith. Meyers should continue providing a solid fantasy floor as the Raiders prepare to face the Colts next Sunday.
#### Rashid Shaheed (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Shaheed caught exactly four passes for the third week in a row. He tied for second on the Saints in targets Sunday, and he's now logged between five and six targets in each of the last three contests. The 26-year-old speedster has just one catch over 20 yards so far this season, but his consistent target share provides a solid floor for deeper leagues in PPR formats. Shaheed will look to maintain his WR2 role behind Chris Olave during New Orleans' next game versus the Giants on Sunday, Oct. 5.
#### Saquon Barkley (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Barkley continued to find tough sledding on the ground against a stout Buccaneers run defense, but he managed to salvage his fantasy day with a six-yard touchdown run late in the third quarter, his third visit to the end zone this season. The reigning Offensive Player of the Year also recorded four catches for the third time in the first four contests, finishing with one of his typically robust workloads. Barkley figures to have to continue grinding for every yard on the ground Week 5, as the Broncos will pay a visit to Philadelphia next Sunday afternoon.
#### Brock Purdy (QB)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Earlier Tuesday, 49ers general manager John Lynch classified Purdy as questionable for Thursday's game against the Rams after the quarterback experienced renewed soreness in his previously sprained toe, which kept him out of action for two games before he started this past Sunday's 26-21 loss to Jacksonville. With Purdy having now gone down as a non-participant on the 49ers' first two Week 5 practice reports, the signal-caller could struggle to gain clearance ahead of Thursday's contest. Backup Mac Jones would be in line to make his third start of the season if Purdy isn't able to make enough progress.
#### Tony Pollard (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Pollard had moments of effectiveness, recording his first rush of at least 20 yards with a gain of 21 early in the second quarter. He also had a decent chunk run of 11 yards one quarter later to reach at least 60 rushing yards for the third time in four games this season. While Pollard has played relatively well, the Tennessee offense is so ineffective that it's hard for any skill-position player to maintain consistent fantasy value, and the eventual return of Tyjae Spears (ankle) will likely cut into Pollard's touch volume.
#### Zach Ertz (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** The 34-year-old tied Luke McCaffrey for the second-most receiving yards on the Commanders in Week 4, trailing Deebo Samuel's 72-yard performance. Although he ranked second on the team in yards, Ertz's performance was a little underwhelming considering two of the team's top three wideouts, Terry McLaurin (quadriceps) and Noah Brown (groin), were sidelined Sunday. Regardless, Ertz's target volume will likely stabilize when Jayden Daniels (knee) returns from injury, which could come in the Week 5 matchup against the Chargers.
