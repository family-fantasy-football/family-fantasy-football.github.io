## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Bijan Robinson (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Robinson posted his second-highest total of the season with 193 scrimmage yards. He was stopped for no gain on first-and-goal from the one-yard line late in the first half and watched Tyler Allgeier power in a game-tying one-yard touchdown on the next play. Bijan produced a rushing touchdown of his own with a five-yard scoring run in the third quarter, but it was only his fifth touchdown run of the season compared to Allgeier's eight. Robinson has produced at least 107 scrimmage yards in three consecutive games and in eight of 12 games overall heading into a Week 14 home game against Seattle's stout run defense.
</div>

### 🟢 Xavier Legette (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The second-year pro from South Carolina didn't benefit from the Panthers' run-heavy approach (40 rush attempts) during Sunday's win, failing to reach double-digit receiving yards for the third time this season. When Carolina did pass, Legette was outshined by Jalen Coker and Tetairoa McMillan, who combined to catch five of eight targets for 117 yards and two touchdowns. Legette now has 28 catches on 53 targets for 287 yards and three touchdowns through 11 games, and his week-to-week volatility makes him a risky fantasy option for the remainder of the year.
</div>

### 🟢 Colston Loveland (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Loveland caught a crucial seven-yard pass from Caleb Williams on a fourth-down play late in the third quarter, which extended the Bears' drive and led to a four-yard touchdown run from Kyle Monangai five plays later. Loveland finished tied with Luther Burden and Rome Odunze for the team lead in targets Friday, and Loveland has seen at least five targets from Williams in four of the Bears' last six games. Loveland's role in head coach Ben Johnson's offense has increased since the Bears' Week 5 bye, and the rookie tight end will look to stay productive Week 14 against the Packers on Sunday, Dec. 7.
</div>

### 🟡 Dylan Sampson (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Sampson was ruled out for the remainder of Sunday's game against San Francisco in the third quarter after he rushed four times for 23 yards. However, it sounds like the rookie running back avoided a serious injury. If Sampson needs to miss time, Jerome Ford would likely reassume his role as the pass-catching complement to Quinshon Judkins.
</div>

### 🟢 Jaydon Blue (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> 
</div>

### 🟢 Bo Nix (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Nix required the extra overtime period in order to put away the now 3-9 Commanders and extend the Broncos' current win streak to nine games. The 45 attempts and 321 passing yards marked the second-highest totals in each respective category for the sophomore signal-caller through 12 starts this year. The Oregon product hasn't taken a step forward from his promising rookie totals in 2024, but he has maintained steady fantasy value with modest passing numbers to go along with 20 combined touchdowns to 10 turnovers. Nix will attempt to clean up the two interceptions he threw against the Raiders back in Week 10 when these two AFC West rivals face off again next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Kalif Raymond (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Out<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Raymond was injured in the Lions' Week 12 win over the Giants and missed last Thursday's loss to the Packers. If both Raymond and Amon-Ra St. Brown (ankle) are unable to play Thursday night against Dallas, the Lions would likely roll with a three-wide set of Jameson Williams, Isaac TeSlaa and Tom Kennedy. It's also notable that Sam LaPorta (back) remains on injured reserve.
</div>

### 🟡 Parker Washington (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Washington will thus finish Week 13 with one catch on three targets for 26 yards. The wideout's next chance to see game action will arrive Dec. 7 against the Colts. In his absence for the rest of Sunday's contest, Brian Thomas, Jakobi Meyers, Tim Patrick and Austin Trammell are the Jaguars' available WRs.
</div>

### 🟢 Brashard Smith (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Smith played just five snaps and didn't see a touch on offense following Isiah Pacheco's return from a three-game absence due to a knee injury. Smith figures to see seldom use on offense in games for which Pacheco and Kareem Hunt are both active, though Smith should continue to see work on kickoffs as a returner.
</div>

### 🟢 Geno Smith (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Smith connected with Brock Bowers for a pair of six-yard touchdowns but also threw his 14th interception, which is tied with Tua Tagovailoa for the highest interception total in the NFL. This was only Smith's second multi-touchdown passing performance in his last eight starts, but he likely did enough to maintain the starting quarterback role in Week 14 against the elite Broncos defense. The 2-10 Raiders also have Kenny Pickett on the roster and got third-string quarterback Aidan O'Connell back from a preseason wrist injury prior to their Week 12 loss to the Browns.
</div>

### 🟢 Kyren Williams (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Williams was injured in the second quarter but started the first series of the second half and finished Week 13 with a 13-72-1 rushing line on 67 percent of the offensive snaps. Blake Corum rushed seven times for 81 yards and one touchdown on 33 percent of the snaps. If Williams would need to miss any time, Corum would be an immediate plug-and-play fantasy RB1 for next Sunday's game against the Cardinals. It sounds like Williams avoided any sort of serious injury.
</div>

### 🟢 Puka Nacua (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Davante Adams was on the other end of both of Matthew Stafford's TD passes on the day, but Nacua led the Rams in catches and targets. Nacua has hauled in at least five passes in five straight games since returning from an ankle sprain in Week 9, racking up a 32-403-2 line on 42 targets over that stretch. The third-year wideout will look to keep rolling in a Week 14 divisional clash with the Cardinals.
</div>

### 🟢 Tank Bigsby (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Bigsby had received at least one carry in each of the Eagles' last five games prior to Friday's loss. The negative game script likely factored into his lack of playing time, as Philadelphia turned to a pass-catching back in Will Shipley when spelling Saquon Barkley while trailing for nearly the entire game. Despite limited usage, Bisgby has been incredibly efficient in his 11 games with the Eagles, averaging 9.1 yards per carry on just 18 rush attempts. However, he'll likely remain a minimal portion of the team's offensive game plan in the Week 14 matchup against the Chargers.
</div>

### 🟢 Cade Otton (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Otton was able to record multiple catches for the ninth consecutive game, but Sunday's yardage matched his lowest output over that stretch. The tight end has yet to find the end zone over 12 contests this season, something he'll look to change in Week 14 against the Saints.
</div>

### 🟢 Emeka Egbuka (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Egbuka finished as the team leader in receptions and targets on the afternoon, even as Chris Godwin took on an enhanced role compared to his Week 12 return and finished with a team-high 78 yards. Egbuka has posted between three and six receptions in the last six contests, but he's been above 58 receiving yards just once in that same span. Egbuka should have a chance to put together a more productive performance in a Week 14 home matchup against a beatable Saints defense.
</div>

### 🟢 Deebo Samuel (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Samuel was overshadowed by strong showings from both Terry McLaurin and Zach Ertz, but he had a solid performance of his own. He did the majority of his damage in overtime, recording a 38-yard reception down the right sideline that came two yards shy of the end zone. Samuel has at least five targets in each of his last five games, and his usage down the field has started to rebound, as he has three receptions of at least 20 yards combined across his last two games.
