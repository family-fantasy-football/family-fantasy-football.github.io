## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Michael Wilson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Wilson resumed the top wideout role for Arizona with Marvin Harrison (heel) back on the sidelines, and the results were the same as we saw in Weeks 11 and 12. The 25-year-old Wilson elevated his game for the third time in Harrison's absence, finishing with double-digit receptions in all three contests. Wilson completed the fantasy explosion with a pair of trips to the end zone, doubling the season total he entered Sunday's loss with. Harrison's Week 15 status is still uncertain, but Wilson should be treated as a WR1 in fantasy if the former misses next Sunday's matchup against Houston.
</div>

### 🟢 Kirk Cousins (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Falcons were limited to just three field goals on the day, as Cousins simply couldn't get anything going. The absence of Drake London (knee) was noticeable, as tight end Kyle Pitts was the only Atlanta pass catcher to make much of an impact. Cousins has a 3:3 TD:INT in three starts since Michael Penix (knee) was lost for the season, but the veteran QB might have more success in Week 15 against the Buccaneers.
</div>

### 🟢 Lamar Jackson (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jackson continued his pattern of partial practice weeks ahead of this key divisional matchup, but he looked more agile than he has in recent games. With the help of a long rush of nine yards as well as a six-yard touchdown scamper just before halftime, Jackson logged his most rushing yards since Week 4 -- when he originally suffered a hamstring injury. He was boom-or-bust as a passer, as he connected with Zay Flowers for three gains of more than 30 yards but still ended up with an inefficient 6.3 yards per attempt. As was the case in Week 13, Jackson could have added a touchdown to his ledger, as he appeared to complete a go-ahead score late in the fourth quarter to Isaiah Likely, but the play was controversially overturned. Though it still wasn't Jackson's strongest performance, this was a step forward from his recent level of play.
</div>

### 🟢 Quinshon Judkins (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Judkins had a true mixed bag of an afternoon, repeatedly being stymied by a Titans run defense that has shown definite signs of improvement over the second half of the season but breaking loose for a career-long reception. Judkins also had the ball in his hands on a would-be game-tying two-point attempt, but the running back threw the ball across the field incomplete. Judkins will look to make inroads against a beatable Bears run defense in a Week 15 road matchup next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Jameson Williams (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Despite Amon-Ra St. Brown managing to play through his ankle issue, Williams put together a second straight impressive performance. The speedy fourth-year pro tied with Jahmyr Gibbs for the team lead in receptions and with St. Brown for the same slotting in targets, while setting the pace in receiving yards. Williams has drawn 19 targets over the last two games while recording at least 88 receiving yards in four straight, affording him plenty of momentum heading into a Week 15 road showdown against the Rams on Sunday, Dec. 14.
</div>

### 🟢 Nico Collins (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Collins was the only Texans pass catcher to make a significant impact in a defensive showdown. He was unsurprisingly C.J. Stroud's favorite target, and he did the majority of his damage on long catches of 53 and 46 yards in the first half. After an inconsistent start to the season, Collins now has at least 75 receiving yards in five of his last six games and has topped 100 yards in three contests on the campaign.
</div>

### 🟢 Jonathan Taylor (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Taylor got off to a strong start, racking up 15 yards and a touchdown on four carries on the Colts' second drive. However, things went downhill from there, as Daniel Jones (Achilles) exited the game, allowing the Jaguars' defense to focus their entire attention on Taylor, and Taylor also lost a fumble early in the second quarter that led directly to a Jaguars' score. His efficiency had already suffered of late, and the state of the Colts' offense is a concern moving forward. Both factors dampen Taylor's fantasy outlook for the rest of the season, though his volume and ability to hit for long runs will still give him the chance to be a strong fantasy performer.
</div>

### 🟢 Brock Bowers (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Bowers made a quick impact in the game, with his first catch going for a 15-yard score on the final play of the first quarter. That matched his longest gain of the game, and though his performance was muted for most of the remainder of the contest, Bowers ultimately finished second on the team in targets, receptions and yards. He will likely remain plagued by poor quarterback play for the rest of the season, though he has still managed six touchdowns in his last six matchups.
</div>

### 🟢 Kimani Vidal (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> It's worth noting Vidal got the start in the primetime game, but the distribution of touches ended up being split right down the middle, as the returning Omarion Hampton (ankle) also recorded 15 touches in the the contest. Vidal's fantasy day was salvaged by a simple checkdown in the first half, which the rookie exploded for 60 yards to set up a touchdown on the team's opening drive, but he otherwise was kept in check on the ground. It won't get much easier Week 15 against a Kansas City team that will be playing for its playoff lives.
</div>

### 🟢 Oronde Gadsden II (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Sunday included the rookie's fewest receptions in a game dating back to Week 5 and his second-lowest yardage total after breaking out against the Dolphins back in Week 6. Negative game scripts have largely impacted Gadsden, as the Chargers have either blown out opponents or been blown out themselves in most of their contests throughout the month of November. A matchup against the Eagles in Week 14 could be a remedy for more volume, but the status of quarterback Justin Herbert will be incredibly relevant, as the Pro Bowler will have surgery to repair a fracture in his left hand Monday, leaving his status uncertain for the critical bout.
</div>

### 🟢 Tua Tagovailoa (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Tagovailoa absorbed a big hit but delivered a three-yard touchdown pass to Jaylen Waddle on the opening drive. Miami's other three touchdowns all came on the ground, with De'Von Achane (ribs), Jaylen Wright and Ollie Gordon each scoring one. Achane exited in the second quarter, so the Dolphins went heavier on traditional runs rather than the screen passes that usually allow Achane to contribute as a receiver in space while padding Tagovailoa's passing stats. Tagovailoa notoriously struggles in cold conditions, and after this unimpressive statistical outing, he seems unlikely to heat up literally or figuratively in Week 15 at Pittsburgh.
</div>

### 🟢 Jaylen Waddle (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Waddle capped the opening drive with a three-yard touchdown catch. Miami went with a run-heavy approach the rest of the way while playing with the lead and facing third-string Jets quarterback Brady Cook for most of the game, but Waddle still reached the five-catch threshold for the eighth time this season while leading the team in targets, catches and receiving yards. Waddle will have a nice opportunity to build on this outing in Week 15 against a Steelers defense that has struggled to contain wide receivers.
</div>

### 🟢 Jordan Addison (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> With J.J. McCarthy back under center for the Vikings, Addison led the team in catches, targets and receiving yards, although all three of the QB's passing touchdowns went to tight ends instead of wideouts. Addison's yardage total was his highest since Week 7, and if McCarthy can stay healthy and gain confidence down the stretch, it would be good news for the team's entire passing attack. Addison could be positioned for a ceiling game in Week 15 against a vulnerable Cowboys defense.
</div>

### 🟢 Devin Neal (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Neal drew another start in place of Alvin Kamara (knee) and surprisingly found some running room against a normally stingy Buccaneers front. The rookie sixth-round pick set a new career high in rushing yardage and added a three-yard touchdown run early in the first quarter for his first career score. With the 3-10 Saints firmly in evaluation mode as head coach Kellen Moore's first season at the helm winds down, Neal could continue to see expanded opportunity irrespective of Kamara's availability down the stretch.
</div>

### 🔴 Garrett Wilson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Injured Reserve<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Wilson last saw game action in Week 10, but it remains unclear if or when he'll return to the lineup as Jets' last four games approach. With the team 3-10 and out of playoff contention, there's no reason to hurry Wilson back, and if he remains sidelined this coming Sunday against the Jaguars, John Metchie, Adonai Mitchell and Isaiah Williams would continue to lead New York's WR corps.
</div>

### 🟢 Jaylen Warren (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Steelers' offense had an abysmal showing on the ground, as their 17 rushing attempts led to only 34 yards. Warren still led the backfield in attempts, but his only impact on the game came as a pass catcher, and in particular on a 38-yard touchdown catch late in the third quarter. Warren has been touchdown-reliant for the last several weeks due to his inefficiency as a rusher, but he has found the end zone in three straight contests and has five scores in his last six games.
</div>

### 🟢 Tyjae Spears (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Spears played his usual No. 2 role behind Tony Pollard, but in a rare game script for Tennessee in which the ground attack's opportunities weren't capped, the latter outpaced the former by 17 carries and erupted for 161 rushing yards and a pair of scores. That left Spears in a clear complementary role, although his receiving yardage total actually paced the Titans on the afternoon. Spears should continue operating as a clear No. 2 behind Pollard in a Week 15 road trip to San Francisco.
