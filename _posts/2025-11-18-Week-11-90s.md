## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Michael Wilson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Cardinals were quickly in catch-up mode Week 11, with QB Jacoby Brissett eventually attempting 57 passes and completing 47 of them to set a single-game NFL record in the latter category. Wilson was the biggest beneficiary in the absence of No. 1 WR Marvin Harrison (concussion), but it was difficult to project such an outburst from the former, as his previous single-game highs were eight catches, nine targets and 95 receiving yards through two-and-a-half years as a pro. A repeat performance from Wilson is unlikely next Sunday against the Jaguars, but if Harrison remains sidelined, Wilson still should be heavily involved in Arizona's passing attack.
</div>

### 🟢 Lamar Jackson (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jackson popped up on the injury report after missing one practice due to knee soreness, but his status for Sunday's tilt was never in jeopardy. The 28-year-old did not appear to be hampered by his knee, instead falling victim to a dominant performance by Myles Garrett (4.0 sacks) and the Cleveland defense. Jackson and the Ravens got the last laugh after earning the comeback victory on the back of Derrick Henry's excellent rushing day (18-103-1). Look for a healthy Jackson to let loose next Sunday against a Jets defense missing much of its star power after cleaning house at the trade deadline.
</div>

### 🟢 Quinshon Judkins (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Judkins was stymied on the ground Sunday, falling short of the four yards-per-carry benchmark used to gauge a runner's effectiveness. It was the second time that the talented rookie was held in check by the Ravens' defense, resulting in a 60.0 rushing yard average with no touchdowns against the Browns' division rival this regular season. After a pair of inefficient outings coming out of Cleveland's Week 9 bye, Judkins' managers will look for a respite next Sunday against the Raiders, who are giving up over 100 rushing yards per game to opponents in 2025.
</div>

### 🟢 Jameson Williams (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Williams accounted for Detroit's only touchdown of the game with a 40-yard score, with most of the yardage coming after the catch. It was a poor offensive night from the Lions, but Williams also chipped in long gains of 27 and 19 yards to provide at least some positivity. This was his third-highest yardage total of the season, and he now has 10 catches for 207 yards and two touchdowns combined across the two games since head coach Dan Campbell took over offensive play-calling.
</div>

### 🟡 Nico Collins (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 Jonathan Taylor (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The highlights of yet another memorable day for Taylor were his final two touchdowns, which consisted of an 83-yard run with just over six minutes remaining in regulation and the game-winning eight-yard scamper up the middle in overtime. Taylor's yardage total fell just short of the career-high 253 he gained against the Jaguars as a rookie back in January 2021, and it served as his third tally of more than 150 yards already this season. Taylor also now has four three-touchdown performances in his MVP-caliber 2025 campaign, and he'll have a Week 11 bye to take a breath before returning to action in a Week 12 road showdown against the Chiefs on Sunday, Nov. 23.
</div>

### 🟢 Brock Bowers (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Bowers was able to get back on track following last week's one-catch dud, finishing Monday's loss as the Raiders' leading receiver on a team-high 12 targets. The 22-year-old phenom did suffer a couple of uncharacteristic drops, but the seven receptions still checked in as his second-highest total through seven starts. A healthy Bowers will attempt to make up for time lost to a knee injury earlier in the campaign with a strong run in the second half. His next opportunity to build on a 39-455-3 receiving line will come in a home matchup against the Browns on Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Oronde Gadsden II (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Gadsden had just one catch for 13 yards until late in the fourth quarter when he caught a 28-yard pass from backup quarterback Trey Lance when the game was well out of hand. It was a challenge most of the afternoon for the Los Angeles offense, as Justin Herbert threw for just 81 yards prior to being removed from the blowout loss. After big production in October, Gadsden has cooled off in back-to-back weeks, with just five catches for 54 yards on 11 targets over the past two games. The Chargers have a Week 12 bye before hosting the Raiders at home in Week 13.
</div>

### 🟢 Kimani Vidal (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Vidal had exited the contest due to a thigh issue, but he was able to return to the Chargers' Week 11 backfield, which also includes Amar Johnson and Trayveon Williams.
</div>

### 🟢 Jaylen Waddle (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Waddle's yardage total wasn't anything to write home about, but it was good enough to lead the Dolphins on a day when Tua Tagovailoa threw for only 171 yards. Waddle also paced Miami in targets and contributed a game-long 31-yard grab, and he's now eclipsed 50 receiving yards in six of the last seven games overall, including four straight. Waddle will next take aim at the Saints secondary in a Week 13 home matchup on Sunday, Nov. 30 following a Week 12 bye.
</div>

### 🟢 Tua Tagovailoa (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Tagovailoa's final line underscores the game manager role he played in the overseas win, one in which he withstood three sacks but still managed a solid 8.6 yards per attempt. The veteran signal-caller worked with a tight circle of five targets, and the fact he was able to remain turnover-free for only the second time in the last six games may have been as encouraging an aspect of his performance as any. Tagovailoa has thrown for under 200 yards in each of the last two contests heading into the Week 12 bye, but Miami has notably recorded victories in both contests.
</div>

### 🟢 Jordan Addison (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Addison was almost the hero after a quiet 59 minutes, as his 15-yard touchdown catch with 50 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter tied the game, and Minnesota took a 17-16 lead with the ensuing PAT. The Bears answered with a game-winning field goal to drop the Vikings to 4-6. Addison has caught just five of 18 targets from struggling quarterback J.J. McCarthy in Minnesota's last two games ahead of a Week 12 road game against the Packers.
</div>

### 🟢 Jordan Mason (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Mason didn't get many opportunities as the Vikings played catch-up for most of the game, so superior pass catcher Aaron Jones out-touched Mason 19-6. Mason made the most of his limited chances, breaking free for a 16-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter. With Jones operating as the top option in Minnesota's backfield heading into a Week 12 trip to Green Bay, Mason may not get many carries against the stout Packers run defense.
</div>

### 🔴 Garrett Wilson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Injured Reserve<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Wilson was placed on IR prior to Thursday's loss to the Patriots. He will sit out a minimum of three more games, so the earliest Wilson could return would be Week 15 against the Jaguars. It's encouraging for Wilson's fantasy managers that the Jets haven't committed to shutting their top receiver down for the season, even though the Jets are out of the playoff hunt at 2-8.
</div>

### 🟡 Jaylen Warren (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Warren carried 10 times for 62 yards and added two receptions for five yards before checking out of this past Sunday's 34-12 win over the Bengals in the third quarter after tweaking his ankle. The 27-year-old said after the contest that he could have returned to the game, but the Steelers opted to play it safe in the final quarter and let Kenneth Gainwell and Kaleb Johnson pick up extra reps out of the backfield. Tomlin's comments Tuesday seemingly support the notion that Warren's early exit was precautionary, but Warren will likely still need to upgrade to full practice participation by Friday in order to avoid a designation for the Week 12 contest.
</div>

### 🟢 Tyjae Spears (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Spears was unable to get anything going on the ground, posting a season-low three rushing yards. The running back was able to set a new season high in receptions, though, leading the team in that category. Spears remains limited by the Titans' overall lack of upside offensively, but he has now secured at least three catches in five straight games.
</div>

### 🟢 Marcus Mariota (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Mariota was brought down hard on the turf after uncorking an incomplete pass with 3:41 remaining in the third quarter. Josh Johnson stepped in at quarterback to finish out the drive before the Commanders punted the ball away. After emerging from the Commanders' medical tent following his evaluation, Mariota was seen throwing the football on the sideline, per Keim. Mariota thus looks like he'll have a chance to return to the game in the fourth quarter, but if not, he'll finish the day having completed 16 of 22 passes for 160 yards and a touchdown to go with five yards on three carries.
</div>
