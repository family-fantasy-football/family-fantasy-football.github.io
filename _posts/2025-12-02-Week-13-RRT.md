## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Trey McBride (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Despite Marvin Harrison's return from a two-game absence due to an appendectomy, McBride remained highly involved as customary and finished the afternoon leading the Cardinals across the board in receptions, receiving yards and targets. The standout tight end also came down with his eighth touchdown grab of the season on a 15-yard grab with just under five minutes remaining in the game, which served as the final points of the day for either squad. McBride has at least eight receptions and 79 yards in four consecutive games and six of the last seven overall, keeping him as an elite option heading into a Week 14 home matchup against the Rams next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Chuba Hubbard (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The fifth-year running back topped 100 scrimmage yards for the first time all season and got into the end zone for the first time since Week 8. He turned a screen pass into a 35-yard TD in the first quarter for Carolina's first points of the afternoon. Hubbard's touch volume also tied his season high, and with Rico Dowdle (58 rushing yards on 18 carries) struggling to make an impact in recent weeks, the workload split in the Panthers backfield may be tipping back in Hubbard's favor. The team will be on bye next week, so clarity in the pecking order likely won't come until a Week 15 clash with the Saints.
</div>

### 🟢 Kyle Monangai (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Monangai surprisingly returned to a starter-level workload despite D'Andre Swift being active and gaining 125 rushing yards of his own while also punching in a score. Monangai outpaced his veteran backfield mate by four carries and recorded his fifth rush TD of the season on a four-yard run early in the fourth quarter. Monangai had topped out at 12 carries in terms of a single-game tally in the last three contests, so the boost in volume Friday was significant and surprising. Nevertheless, the division of labor in the backfield is likely to continue fluctuating game to game moving forward, and Friday's usage for both backs was largely the result of a favorable game script and clear matchup advantage.
</div>

### 🟢 Ja'Marr Chase (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Chase co-led the Bengals in receptions while easily setting the pace in receiving yards and targets on a night when Joe Burrow returned from a nine-game absence. The elite wideout was operating without Tee Higgins (concussion), and Chase finished with his fourth-highest target tally of the campaign while eclipsing the 100-yard mark for the fifth time on the season. Higgins will likely be back for a Week 14 road showdown against the Bills on Sunday, Dec. 7, but Chase should naturally remain Burrow's clear No. 1 target in a contest that could feature plenty of passing.
</div>

### 🔴 Joe Burrow (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Making his return from a nine-game absence, Burrow shook off rust as the game went on and put together a strong fantasy performance overall highlighted by 14- and 29-yard touchdown passes to Tanner Hudson and Andrei Iosivas, respectively. Burrow spread the ball around to nine different pass catchers overall, with Ja'Marr Chase unsurprisingly garnering the majority of his attention in the form of 14 targets in the absence of Tee Higgins (concussion). Burrow helped lead the Bengals to 20 second-half points and also benefited from a standout performance by his team's oft-maligned defense, infusing some badly needed momentum ahead of a Week 14 road showdown against Josh Allen and the Bills on Sunday, Dec. 7.
</div>

### 🟢 David Montgomery (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The second-quarter TD was Montgomery's sixth of the season, but his first since Week 9, as Jahmyr Gibbs had produced Detroit's last four rushing touchdowns. Montgomery has been more clearly the No. 2 option in the Lions' backfield this season as opposed to a 1B behind Gibbs, but he's still delivered 543 rushing yards in 12 games along with a 20-151-0 line on 24 targets. Montgomery will look to get into the end zone in consecutive games for the first time since Weeks 2 and 3 in a Week 14 matchup against the Cowboys.
</div>

### 🟢 Christian Watson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Watson may have gotten away with a pushoff on his 51-yard touchdown catch in the third quarter but the play stood as his third touchdown catch in the past three games and accounted for the majority of his production Thursday. His season debut didn't come until Week 8, but Watson has recorded at least 45 receiving yards in all six of his appearances, establishing himself as the top receiving option in a Green Bay offense that's normally run-heavy, Thursday's four-touchdown performance from Jordan Love notwithstanding. Watson's fantasy stock continues to rise heading into another NFC North matchup in Week 14 against the Bears.
</div>

### 🟢 Dalton Schultz (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Schultz was able to secure at least six passes for the fourth time in five games, rebounding nicely after his one-catch performance in Week 12. The tight end didn't skip a beat with the return of C.J. Stroud either, calming the nerves of fantasy managers. Schultz has now corralled 59 of 80 targets for 552 yards and a touchdown over 12 contests this season.
</div>

### 🟢 Josh Downs (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Downs was limited to two or fewer catches for a third straight week, though he did lead the team in targets versus Houston. The wide receiver has now reeled in five of 14 targets for 57 yards without finding the end zone over the last three games. Downs hasn't exceeded 57 receiving yards in any of the 11 contests he's played in this year, limiting his ceiling greatly from a fantasy perspective.
</div>

### 🟢 Travis Etienne Jr. (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Jaguars dominated the game on the scoreboard, but their offensive showing wasn't all that impressive. The running game was the primary culprit, as Etienne matched his lowest yards-per-rush mark of the season, and his longest gain on the ground went for only six yards. The lone positive was that he worked as the clear lead back ahead of Bhayshul Tuten, though Etienne did cede several carries around the goal line to the rookie.
</div>

### 🟢 Matthew Stafford (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The veteran quarterbacks hit Davante Adams for two more red-zone TDs in the first half, but the Rams' passing game sputtered after halftime as the game slipped away. The picks were his first since Week 3, and it was the first time all season that Stafford had given the ball away more than once, but he did extend his streak of games with multiple touchdown passes to six, a stretch in which he's delivered a 20:2 TD:INT. Stafford will look to bounce back in a Week 14 divisional clash with the Cardinals.
</div>

### 🟢 Rhamondre Stevenson (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Stevenson saw one more carry than TreVeyon Henderson in the run-heavy game plan, but he finished with 27 fewer yards. However, Stevenson was the more effective receiver of the two thanks to his co-game-high 36-yard reception, which helped the veteran to his second-highest receiving yardage total of the campaign. Stevenson doubled his Week 12 workload on the ground, but Henderson likely remains the No. 1 option heading into a Week 15 home clash on Sunday, Dec. 14 against the Bills following a Week 14 bye.
</div>

### 🟢 A.J. Brown (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Brown was one of the few bright spots in an Eagles offense that otherwise looked stagnant again. He accounted for both of the team's touchdowns with scores from 33 and four yards away, marking his second consecutive game reaching the end zone. Brown chipped in four additional receptions of at least 15 yards to top the century mark for the second straight matchup. While it's still been a disappointing season overall from Brown, he appears to have overtaken DeVonta Smith as Jalen Hurts' favorite target for the time being.
</div>

### 🟡 Sam Darnold (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Darnold was in the blue medical tent on the sideline a couple times against Minnesota, but he didn't miss any offensive snaps prior to giving way to Drew Lock for the final drive of the 26-0 win. Darnold might be listed on the injury report this week, but it sounds like it would be a surprise to see him have an injury designation ahead of next Sunday's game against Atlanta.
</div>

### 🟢 Cooper Kupp (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Kupp has now finished with either 23 or 24 yards exactly in three straight games, and he was able to lead all wideouts in receiving yards in Week 13. The 32-year-old hasn't exceeded three catches in a game since Week 5, and he hasn't found the end zone over his last five contests, limiting his upside greatly.
</div>

### 🟢 Jaxon Smith-Njigba (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Smith-Njigba's fantasy managers suffered through an unfavorable game script that saw Seattle's defense and rushing attack take care of Minnesota in Week 13. QB Sam Darnold completed just 54 percent of his passes while failing to establish any rhythm while the game was still competitive in the first half. The end result was Smith-Njigba's worst fantasy score of 2025, which comes on the heels of his most-dominant showing against the Titans last Sunday (8-167-2). JSN is still the clear WR1 in fantasy this season even with this dud, carrying a sparkling 82-1,336-7 receiving line into next Sunday's tilt against the Falcons.
