## Player Report

#### Bijan Robinson (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** A field day was expected for the Falcons' ground attack going in, but the Panthers defense completely turned that expectation on its head with a surprisingly dominant performance. Robinson still managed to churn out a solid effort that highlighted both his rushing and receiving acumen, but his workload on the ground was certainly more sparse than it would have been had the Falcons made good on their status as solid favorites. Robinson will next take aim at the Commanders defense when Washington pays Atlanta a visit for a Week 4 matchup next Sunday.
#### Xavier Legette (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** questionable
#### Colston Loveland (TE)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Loveland suffered a hip injury during the second quarter of Sunday's win over the Cowboys, but it appears he has a chance to avoid missing any significant time. The rookie first-rounder flashed his downfield playmaking ability before leaving the field versus Dallas, securing one of three targets for 31 yards. If Loveland is forced to miss time or face a limited snap count, Cole Kmet will handle an expanded workload at tight end.
#### Dylan Sampson (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Sampson was on the field for just five offensive snaps and went untargeted for the first time in three weeks. He had eight targets in Week 1 followed by a touchdown catch last week, but it looks like Jerome Ford has emerged as the primary target out of the backfield. In addition to the diminished targets, Sampson's overall usage has taken a hit, dropping from 33 snaps in Week 1 to 17 in Week 2 and now five. That drop coincides with the availability of Quinshon Judkins.
#### Jaydon Blue (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Blue has now been a healthy scratch in each of Dallas' first three games of the campaign. Javonte Williams and Miles Sanders will again be the team's two active RBs in Week 3.
#### Bo Nix (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Nix didn't perform particularly poorly, rather falling victim to a dominating ball-control performance from the Chargers (-12:40 in time of possession Sunday). The dual-threat quarterback recorded his highest rushing total of the campaign in the loss while committing no turnovers for the first time in three starts. Nix will attempt to put it all together in a very favorable matchup against the Bengals next Monday.
#### Kalif Raymond (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Raymond remains an afterthought on offense for Detroit, and his production dropped for the third week in a row. The wide receiver is firmly behind Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jameson Williams on the depth chart, and his weekly upside is greatly reduced as a result. On the year, he's caught four of six targets for 34 yards, while also adding a nine-yard carry over three games.
#### Geno Smith (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** All three TDs went to Tre Tucker, as the duo connected on 10-yard scores in the second and fourth quarters before Smith found his speedy wideout for a 61-yard strike late in the game as the Raiders tried to mount a comeback. It was a strong bounce-back performance from Smith after he got picked off three times by the Chargers in Week 2, but the result was the same for Las Vegas. Smith will try to guide his team back into the win column in Week 4 against an injury-ravaged Bears defense.
#### Kyren Williams (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Williams easily led the Rams backfield in carries, but Blake Corum continued to carve out a role in the offense with eight rushing attempts. That didn't affect Williams' performance in Week 3, as he still managed a season high in both carries and yardage. Williams also made an impact as a receiver for the first time on the campaign, catching a 10-yard touchdown to kick off the third quarter. While Williams may be losing some of his workload, the Rams offense should be efficient enough for him to remain a reliable fantasy contributor moving forward.
#### Puka Nacua (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Nacua dominated opportunity amongst the Rams' receiving corps, accounting for 15 targets on 34 total pass attempts for the team. It wasn't his most efficient performance, though he still managed long gains of 20, 15 and 12 yards to top 100 yards from scrimmage for the third stright game to begin the campaign. While Davante Adams has been impactful in the Rams' offense, Nacua looks likely to remain the top producer most weeks.
#### Tyreek Hill (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Hill led the Dolphins in targets and receiving yards on the night, adding his first touchdown catch of the season on a five-yard grab early in the fourth quarter. The mercurial speedster has logged 23 targets through three games and parlayed them into a 15-198-1 line, but Tua Tagovailoa's overall struggles and the general malaise that's seemingly befallen the Dolphins keeps Hill's fantasy outlook somewhat murky heading into a Week 4 home matchup against the Jets on Monday night, Sept. 29, a game where he's likely to see plenty of Sauce Gardner's coverage.
#### Tank Bigsby (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Acquired from the Jaguars for a fifth- and sixth-round draft pick at the start of the week, Bigsby was not yet part of the Eagles' offensive gameplan. His only snaps came on special teams. He'll compete with Will Shipley (ribs) and AJ Dillon for the backup role behind Saquon Barkley once he's more integrated with his new team.
#### Cade Otton (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Otton had a 92 percent snap share (66 snaps), making the fact he didn't see so much as a single target all the more alarming. The fourth-year tight end has now gone without a catch in two of the first three games despite the team's multiple absences at wide receiver, but he would seem to have a good chance of being much more involved in a Week 4 home showdown against the Eagles, especially if Mike Evans (hamstring) sits out the contest.
#### Emeka Egbuka (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** The rookie continued an impressive start to his NFL career, leading the Buccaneers in catches and yards while tying Mike Evans in targets. Evans left the game in the fourth quarter with a hamstring injury, and Chris Godwin (ankle) may not be ready to make his season debut next week, which could leave Egbuka and his 14-181-3 line on 21 targets through three contests poised for massive volume in Week 4 against an Eagles secondary that just got torched for 11 catches and 112 yards by the Rams' Puka Nacua.
#### Calvin Ridley (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** The Titans continue to prioritize Ridley in their offense, as he led the team in targets Sunday. However, he struggled with drops and lacked rapport with Cam Ward, which led to the poor showing. Ridley has now been held to under 30 receiving yards in two of three games this season despite earning a minimum of six targets in every contest.
#### Deebo Samuel (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** In the wake of Austin Ekeler (Achilles) being lost for the season, Samuel mixed in as part of a backfield committee, but he saw little volume either on the ground or through the air. The lack of usage may have been due largely to the fact that the Commanders were never seriously threatened in the second half, but having Marcus Mariota under center in place of Jayden Daniels (knee) likely had an impact as well. Daniels could return for a Week 4 clash with the Falcons, but even if Mariota is at QB again, Samuel could be relied on heavily if Terry McLaurin (quadriceps) is out or limited.
