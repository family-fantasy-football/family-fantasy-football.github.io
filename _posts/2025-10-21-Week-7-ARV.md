## üè• Player Report

### üü¢ Bijan Robinson (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Robinson struggled to find room to run, with a long gain on the ground of only eight yards. As a result, he failed to reach 70 yards on the ground for only the second time this season and for the first time since Week 1. However, he continued to excel as a pass catcher, highlighted by a 10-yard touchdown reception halfway through the third quarter. Robinson has at least six receptions in half of his six games this season and now has four total touchdowns on the campaign.
</div>

### üü¢ Xavier Legette (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The 2024 first-round pick had the best game of his pro career in the Week 7 win, setting personal highs in both receptions (nine) and receiving yards (92). He led the Panthers' receiving corps in catches, yards and touchdowns, while Tetairoa McMillan, Jimmy Horn and Jalen Coker combined for just four catches for 41 yards on nine targets. Legette has now hauled in 17 of 31 targets for 142 yards and two touchdowns across five appearances this season. He's expected to continue operating as the Panthers' No. 2 wideout and primary deep threat heading into the Week 8 matchup against the Bills.
</div>

### üü¢ Colston Loveland (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Loveland has eight receptions over five contests overall, but with fellow TE Cole Kmet having exited Sunday's contest with a back injury, the rookie first-rounder could see an uptick in snaps against the Ravens this weekend if Kmet is forced to miss time. In such a scenario, Loveland could merit Week 8 lineup consideration with six teams on bye.
</div>

### üü¢ Dylan Sampson (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Sampson was on the field for just nine snaps, but he out-touched veteran Jerome Ford, who had three touches on 13 snaps. The game provided more evidence that the rookie is taking over the No. 2 RB role from Ford. The trade deadline is two weeks away, and Sampson could be all alone behind starter Quinshon Judkins if Ford, who is in the final year of his contract, gets moved. That still may not translate into meaningful fantasy value for Sampson with Judkins dominating the backfield workload for Cleveland, but it would put him on the field more often for an offense that typically plays from behind and needs a reliable third-down back.
</div>

### üü¢ Jaydon Blue (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The rookie running back saw a career-high touch volume, although most of his work came on the Cowboys' final drive when the game was out of reach. Blue remains firmly behind Javonte Williams (116 yards and a TD on 16 carries) in the Dallas backfield, and his only real fantasy value is as an insurance policy for the former Bronco, who's already dealt with one serious knee injury in his NFL career.
</div>

### üü¢ Bo Nix (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Nix bounced back with a monstrous four-score game following a couple weeks of pedestrian stat lines. The 25-year-old fired off a season-high 50 pass attempts in the thrilling comeback victory, but it was his rushing production (5-48-2) that truly made his fantasy score stand out in Week 7. Nix had scored just one rushing touchdown while averaging 20.7 rushing yards over his previous six starts, so managers shouldn't expect gaudy rushing totals on a regular basis. That said, we could be in store for another strong fantasy performance from Nix next Sunday against the Cowboys' 32nd-ranked pass defense.
</div>

### üü¢ Geno Smith (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The futility of the Raiders offense can be stated in many different ways, and Smith was at the center of the lack of production. The unit ran only two offensive plays in Chiefs territory, totaled only three first downs, and ran only 30 offensive plays, the final of which was the second-fewest in the Super Bowl era, per Josh Dubow of The Associated Press. Needless to say, it was a disastrous fantasy performance, and Smith has now thrown for less than 200 yards in four of his seven starts and has zero scores in three contests. He was also replaced by Kenny Pickett late in the game due to the score, but there is no indication that the team is considering a change at quarterback.
</div>

### üü¢ Puka Nacua (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Out<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> out
</div>

### üü¢ Kyren Williams (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Williams' managers suffered a casual stat line in Sunday's one-sided affair after the Rams' passing attack accounted for all five of the team's trips to the end zone in London. The veteran starter's even carry split with Blake Corum (12-37-0) can also be attributed to an unfavorable game script, with six of the backup's carries essentially coming in garbage time. Williams has been a reliable starter in fantasy in 2025, generating 638 yards from scrimmage and five total touchdowns through seven starts. A lack of scoring is the only thing holding the 24-year-old back from his first-round projections, as he is currently on pace to score 12 touchdowns after averaging 15.5 over his last two standout seasons. Williams will be looking to hit pay dirt when the Rams come out of the bye to face the Saints in Week 9.
</div>

### üü¢ Kendre Miller (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Out<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Miller suffered a torn ACL in Sunday's loss to the Bears, which knocks him out for the rest of the 2025 campaign. He had been operating as a sort of 1B to Alvin Kamara's 1A in the New Orleans backfield, totaling a 47-193-1 rushing line across seven contests. With Miller now done for the year, rookie Devin Neal figures to slot in as the RB2 for the Saints. A third-round pick in the 2023 Draft, Miller is under contract through the 2026 season.
</div>

### üü¢ Tank Bigsby (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Bigsby had been strictly used on special teams by the Eagles after they acquired him after Week 1, but he finally earned a small role in the offense in his sixth game with the team. He got involved early, rushing for a first down on the eighth play of the first drive, but his overall role was limited, as he played just four offensive snaps. That trailed Will Shipley, who had eight.
</div>

### üü¢ Cade Otton (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Otton led the Buccaneers in receptions and receiving yards while tying for second in targets. The veteran tight end benefited from the absence of Chris Godwin (fibula) and the early exit of Mike Evans (concussion/collarbone), which helped lead to Otton's season-high catch total. Otton also had what appeared to be a reception ultimately deemed an interception, but he could be due for another busy day in a Week 8 road divisional clash against the Saints if Godwin remains out and exacerbates the confirmed absence of Evans.
</div>

### üü¢ Emeka Egbuka (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The rookie was surprisingly able to play through his hamstring strain, and he finished with a team-high target total while tying for second in both receptions and receiving yards. Egbuka also provided a team-high 30-yard catch, and given Ian Rapoport of NFL Network reports Mike Evans has been diagnosed with a broken collarbone following his first-half exit from Monday's game, the 2025 first-round pick is set to play an elevated role for the rest of the season. Egbuka could be especially busy in Sunday's Week 8 road matchup against the Saints, considering Chris Godwin (fibula) could remain sidelined for that divisional clash.
</div>

### üü° Calvin Ridley (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
