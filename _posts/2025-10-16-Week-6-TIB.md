## üè• Player Report

### üü° Kyler Murray (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Prior to sitting out this past Sunday's game at Indianapolis, Murray managed one limited session Friday, and Ian Rapoport of NFL Network reported late Saturday that the quarterback was tending to a mid-foot sprain that may force him to sit out multiple weeks. Coach Jonathan Gannon told Tyler Drake of ArizonaSports.com on Wednesday that Murray will need to "make sure he's healthy enough to play. We'll progress him along this week and see where he's at." Murray's activity level Thursday and Friday thus will be key for his chances to return Sunday against the Packers, but if he needs more time to recover, Jacoby Brissett is on hand to lead the Cardinals offense.
</div>

### üü° Darnell Mooney (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Falcons didn't practice Wednesday, but the listing suggests Mooney will participate later this week. He hasn't practiced since injuring his hamstring during a Week 4 win over Washington.
</div>

### üü¢ Kyle Pitts Sr. (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Pitts followed up his best performance of the season against the Commanders (5-70-1) with his lowest fantasy score to date on Monday Night Football. Michael Penix was keyed in on Drake London (10-158-1) and Bijan Robinson (6-68-0) in the passing game, leaving scraps for Pitts and the rest of Atlanta's auxiliary options. Pitts still carries a modest 23-223-1 receiving line into a Week 7 road tilt against the 49ers on Sunday.
</div>

### üü¢ Mark Andrews (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The positive for Andrews was that he remained involved in the Baltimore offense, finishing tied for second on the team in targets. He was unable to convert that into much production while catching passes from the combination of Cooper Rush and Tyler Huntley, with his longest gain going for only nine yards. The outlook for all Ravens pass catchers should improve with the anticipated return of Lamar Jackson (hamstring) in Week 8 following the team's bye, though Andrews could lose out on opportunity to more explosive options such as Rashod Bateman and Isaiah Likely.
</div>

### üü¢ Keon Coleman (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Coleman tied for the team lead in receptions and targets, but as his final line indicates, those opportunities were essentially for naught. The second-year wideout has endured an underwhelming season that's included a Week 5 benching for that game's opening series, and Coleman notably couldn't make an impact Monday despite the Bills being without Dalton Kincaid (oblique) and Curtis Samuel (neck/ribs) to begin the game and then losing Joshua Palmer (ankle) during the contest. Coleman and quarterback Josh Allen will have a Week 7 bye to work on their chemistry before returning to action Oct. 26 on the road against the Panthers.
</div>

### üü¢ Tetairoa McMillan (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> As his final line indicates, the rookie first-round pick made excellent use of his trio of catches, turning two of them into 19- and two-yard touchdown grabs for the first pair of end-zone trips of his career. Otherwise, McMillan's reception, yardage and target totals all tied or served as new season lows, making it a mixed bag of a day to an extent from a fantasy perspective. Nevertheless, McMillan's role as Carolina's No. 1 receiver is as iron clad as it gets, but he's likely to draw plenty of Sauce Gardner's attention in a Week 7 visit to the Jets next Sunday afternoon.
</div>

### üü¢ Javonte Williams (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Cowboys were forced into a relatively pass-heavy game script as they kept pace with the Panthers. That limited Williams to a season-low 13 carries, but the primary issue was his lack of efficiency. Williams' longest rush went for only six yards, and his longest reception was good for only nine yards. The positive takeaway is that Williams earned 18 touches and the next closest Dallas back (Jaydon Blue) had only three. Williams should have a strong chance to bounce back in Week 7 against Washington.
</div>

### üü¢ Marvin Mims Jr. (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Mims played 21 of the Broncos' 60 offensive snaps Sunday, behind fellow wide receivers Courtland Sutton (48), Pat Bryant (35) and Troy Franklin (35). The third-year wideout's 35 percent snap share was his lowest mark of the season. Mims has flashed his play-making ability at times this season, but his inconsistent usage in Denver's offense makes him extremely difficult to trust for fantasy purposes. The 23-year-old will have his next chance to take a step forward in a Week 7 matchup against the Giants, yet he'll continue to face stiff competition for targets in a crowded receiving corps.
</div>

### üü° Josh Jacobs (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> After a somewhat slow start to the season, Jacobs has been making the most of his workload over the last two games, combining for 307 yards from scrimmage and four rushing TDs on 49 touches. As the Packers kick off Week 7 prep, he's dealing with an ailment, but his ability to practice in some capacity Wednesday indicates he isn't in much danger of missing Sunday's contest at Arizona. Jacobs will have two more chances to get back to all activity ahead of the weekend.
</div>

### üü° Quentin Johnston (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Johnston approached Week 6 action with a questionable tag after logging limited practices Wednesday through Friday, and he was ultimately deemed inactive for the Chargers' 29-27 win over the Dolphins. Johnston now has two more chances to upgrade his participation level ahead of this Sunday's game against the Colts, but the wideout will likely need to practice fully by Friday in order to avoid a Week 7 injury designation.
</div>

### üü¢ Carson Wentz (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Wentz emerged from the Vikings' last game Week 5 against the Browns in London with an injury to his left, non-throwing shoulder. Coach Kevin O'Connell said Wednesday that Wentz handled every throw at Monday's unofficial session, and the veteran signal-caller seemingly maintained that activity level two days later. Per Alec Lewis of The Athletic, O'Connell also wouldn't name a starter for Week 7 between Wentz and second-year pro J.J. McCarthy, who was limited Wednesday in his first practice since he suffered a high right-ankle sprain Week 2. How McCarthy fares as the week continues likely will determine who is under center for Minnesota on Sunday versus the Eagles.
</div>

### üü¢ Justin Jefferson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jefferson paced the Vikings in receptions, receiving yards and targets on the day, turning in his second consecutive 100-yard effort in the process. His final reception of the contest was especially critical, as he came down with a 21-yard grab to take the ball to the Browns' 27 yard-line with under two minutes remaining on Minnesota's game-winning drive. Jefferson has displayed excellent chemistry with fill-in signal-caller Carson Wentz over the last pair of contests, but J.J. McCarthy (ankle) may be set to return to action when the Vikings come out of a Week 6 bye to host the Eagles on Sunday, Oct. 19.
</div>

### üü¢ Justin Fields (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Fields has yet to throw an interception this season, but his cautious approach hasn't led to any success, as the Jets are the last remaining winless team in the NFL. After mustering only 45 passing yards in the team's Week 6 loss to the Broncos, Fields is looking to take more chances moving forward, which may be required to prevent getting benched in favor of Tyrod Taylor. Bouncing back as a passer won't be easy for Fields on Sunday against the Panthers without Wilson, who has the league's second-highest target share this season.
</div>

### üî¥ Chris Godwin Jr. (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Doubtful<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Though the Buccaneers have yet to officially rule Godwin out for this coming Monday's game against the Lions, head coach Todd Bowles acknowledged earlier in the week that the veteran wideout is likely on track to miss a second straight contest due to a fibula injury. Godwin's absence from the team's first Week 7 practice supports that notion, and he could be one of three key playmakers that the Buccaneers will be without in a matchup with Detroit. In addition to Godwin, receiver Emeka Egbuka (hamstring) and running back Bucky Irving (shoulder/foot) were spectators for Thursday's practice, though wideout Mike Evans (hamstring) returned to the field for the first time since Week 3.
