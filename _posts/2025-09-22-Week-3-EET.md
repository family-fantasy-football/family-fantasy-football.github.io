## Player Report

#### Trey Benson (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** James Conner (ankle) was carted off with a severe ankle injury in the second half of Sunday's loss that will reportedly cost Arizona's starting RB the remainder of the season, per ESPN's Adam Schefter. Benson took over lead back duties and finished with a healthy 4.2 yards per carry. The talented backup immediately becomes a must-add player in fantasy following Conner's unfortunate injury. Emari Demercado figures to enter the mix for touches as well, but he failed to gain positive yards on two carries Sunday. Expect Benson to start for the Cardinals when the team hosts the Seahawks on Thursday Night Football in Week 4.
#### Drake London (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** On a day when the host Panthers delivered a shocking thumping to the Falcons, London managed to cobble together a serviceable, albeit uninspiring, fantasy day. The talented wideout led Atlanta in both receptions and receiving yards while checking in second in targets, and the yardage tally tied London's season high. While Michael Penix took a step back Sunday, London will aim to help the second-year signal-caller atone during a Week 4 home matchup against a Commanders defense that's been prone to allowing chunk plays through the air early this season.
#### Justice Hill (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Baltimore's run game was uncharacteristically shut down by the Browns on Sunday as Hill and Derrick Henry combined for 14 carries and 30 yards. Hill managed to contribute in the passing game with three grabs after being held to just one three-yard reception in the opener. His playing time remained in line with his Week 1 total as he played 22 snaps. His usage can vary week-to-week, but Hill's snap share sits in the 40 percent range.
#### Joshua Palmer (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** After being targeted nine times Week 1 and three times Week 2, Palmer logged just one target (for five yards) Thursday. While a bounce-back is possible as soon as Week 4 against the Saints, fellow WRs Elijah Moore and Tyrell Shavers combined for five targets versus Miami, while Keon Coleman (45) and Khalil Shakir (42) paced the team in terms of Week 3 snaps.
#### Courtland Sutton (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Sutton bounced back nicely from last week's one-catch dud, ripping off a 52-yard touchdown grab while posting his first 100-plus yard performance of the season. The 29-year-old re-established himself as Bo Nix's favorite option, finishing with four more targets than Marvin Mims and rookie Troy Franklin. Sutton will carry a healthy 13-185-2 receiving line into a Week 4 matchup against the Bengals on Monday Night Football.
#### Trevor Lawrence (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Lawrence averaged just 5.6 yards per attempt while failing to throw a touchdown for the first time in three games this season. The 2021 first overall pick spread the ball around to nine different pass catchers overall, and he leveraged another impressive performance by his defense to help the Jaguars garner their second win of the season. To date, Lawrence has concerningly completed just 55.8 of his pass attempts in head coach Liam Coen's typically QB-friendly offense, and he draws another tough matchup in a Week 4 road clash against the 49ers.
#### Hollywood Brown (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Brown's monster usage in Week 1 (16 targets) appears to have been an anomaly after the wideout averaged 5.5 targets in the two games since. The speedy receiver did draw a crucial pass interference flag on a deep shot in the waning moments of the first half that allowed the Chiefs to sneak in a field goal before the break. Xavier Worthy (shoulder) and Rashee Rice (suspension) remained out, with the former having a chance to return against the Ravens next Sunday. Brown will continue filling in as one of Patrick Mahomes' top options until both projected starters have returned to action.
#### Jakobi Meyers (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** After seeing double-digit targets in each of the first two games of 2025, Meyers saw his volume crater in Week 3 as Tre Tucker instead got more of Geno Smith's attention. Meyers has still topped 60 receiving yards in three straight contests en route to a 17-228-0 line on 26 targets, and there could be plenty of volume to go around in Week 4 against a Bears defense that has been one of the worst units in the NFL to begin the year.
#### Aaron Jones Sr. (RB)
**Injury Status:** Injured Reserve <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** ir
#### Rashid Shaheed (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Shaheed finished third in targets, receptions and yardage for the Saints in a one-sided affair Sunday. The 26-year-old has proven to be a solid fantasy option for those in deeper formats, averaging 4.7 receptions and 42.3 yards through three weeks. Expect Shaheed to continue providing a solid floor as New Orleans' No. 2 receiver in a road matchup against the Bills next Sunday.
#### Saquon Barkley (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** The Eagles were chasing the Rams for nearly the entire game, though volume wasn't Barkley's primary problem. Instead, he was held to only 2.6 yards per rush with a long gain of just 12 yards.  Barkley did manage to salvage his day in leagues that reward receptions, as he hauled in four targets for the second time this season. Barkley has yet to hit 100 yards from scrimmage and also has zero 20-yard gains on the ground through three contests.
#### Brock Purdy (QB)
**Injury Status:** Out <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Purdy sat out the 49ers' Week 2 win at New Orleans due to the combination of a turf toe variant and an AC joint sprain in his left shoulder. While the quarterback was able to log three limited practices this week, coach Kyle Shanahan said Friday that Purdy was "highly unlikely" to play in Week 3, according to Schefter. The 49ers won't post their inactives until about 90 minutes before Sunday's 4:25 p.m. ET kickoff, but Purdy's name is expected to be included when they do. Mac Jones will earn another spot start in Purdy's place while Adrian Martinez handles backup duties.
#### Tony Pollard (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** The Titans were forced into a pass-heavy game script by falling behind by three scores early in the third quarter. That limited Pollard's chances on the ground, though he managed a one-yard touchdown plunge a few minutes of game time later. Pollard has found ways to be productive -- he topped 85 yards from scrimmage in each of his first two games -- but the Tennessee offense is likely to continue to limit his upside.
#### Zach Ertz (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** The veteran tight end tied Terry McLaurin (quadriceps) and Luke McCaffrey for the team lead in receptions, as the Commanders did most of their damage on the ground with Marcus Mariota at quarterback instead of Jayden Daniels (knee). Ertz also saw his two-game TD streak end, and he sports a 12-128-2 line on 16 targets to begin the season. If Daniels is able to return in Week 4 against the Falcons, Ertz seems likely to have his target volume perk back up.
