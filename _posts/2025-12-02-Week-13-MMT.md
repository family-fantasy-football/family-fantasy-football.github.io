## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Khalil Shakir (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Shakir struggled with drops, finishing with a season-low catch rate of 25 percent against Pittsburgh's secondary. The four targets still led all Buffalo wide receivers as the team continues searching for reliable auxiliary targets for Josh Allen to throw to. Shakir was fresh off of posting a 100-plus yard receiving game in Week 12's box score, and he remains the top option on the perimeter despite Sunday's putrid effort. Fantasy managers are hoping for a bounce-back effort from Shakir in a soft matchup against Cincinnati's defense next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Harold Fannin Jr. (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Most of the damage came on a 34-yard TD pass from Shedeur Sanders early in the second quarter, the longest passing play of the day by either team on a very windy day in Cleveland. Fannin's five targets and 43 yards paced all Browns pass catchers, and in two-plus games since Sanders took the reins of the offense, the rookie tight end has a 9-109-1 line on 16 targets. Fannin will look for his fourth touchdown of the season in a Week 14 tilt against the Titans.
</div>

### 🟡 George Pickens (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Pickens had his practice reps limited last week with the same injuries and ultimately didn't carry an injury designation into last Thursday's win over the Chiefs. He ended up drawing a season-high 13 targets against Kansas City, turning in a 6-88-0 receiving line on 74 percent of the offensive snaps. He should be fine for Thursday night's game against the Lions.
</div>

### 🟢 Jake Ferguson (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The tight end nearly hauled in his eighth TD of the season late in the third quarter on a 13-yard toss from Dak Prescott, but replay showed that Ferguson's second foot got tangled up with his defenders and never landed in bounds at the back of the end zone. It was still the fourth straight game in which he's caught at least four passes, and Ferguson has 70 receptions on the season -- one short of the career high he set in 2023, and second among all tight ends this year behind Trey McBride's 80. Ferguson will look to establish that new personal best Week 14 against the Lions.
</div>

### 🟢 Jahmyr Gibbs (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> After three straight games with more than 140 scrimmage yards, Gibbs' Thanksgiving output was something of a disappointment. He also watched his backfield partner, David Montgomery, punch in a three-yard score in the second quarter, after Gibbs had delivered Detroit's last four rushing scores. Gibbs did pass the 1,000-yard milestone on the ground for the second straight season, and through 12 games he's amassed 1,019 rushing yards and 397 receiving yards with 13 total TDs. He stands a good chance of producing another ceiling game in Week 14 against the Cowboys.
</div>

### 🟢 Woody Marks (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Marks exited the contest after sustaining a foot injury, but he was subsequently able to return to action and reclaim his role in a Week 13 Houston backfield that also includes Nick Chubb.
</div>

### 🟢 Michael Pittman Jr. (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Daniel Jones distributed targets very evenly between the Colts' top pass catchers, with five players earning at least four targets and none more than six. Pittman failed to even deliver on his limited opportunity, with his only catch coming late in the second quarter. While he has been a reliable target for Daniel Jones this season, this was Pittman's worst yardage total of the season and his third straight contest with fewer than 30 yards.
</div>

### 🟢 Daniel Jones (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jones is reportedly playing through a fractured fibula, but he turned in a solid performance against one of the best pass defenses in the league. He continued to show strong rapport with Alec Pierce, as the duo connected for four gains of at least 18 yards, including a 19-yard touchdown. Jones later tallied his second score of the game on a 12-yard connection with Tyler Warren. Jones has only 399 yards combined across his last two games, though he's posted a 4:1 TD:INT heading into a far more favorable Week 14 matchup against the Jaguars.
</div>

### 🟢 Bhayshul Tuten (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Tuten was out-carried 12 to eight by Travis Etienne, who also out-gained the rookie 28 to 17 on the ground. However, it was Tuten who found the end zone with a two-yard plunge in the third quarter. After rushing a season-high 15 times for 74 yards and one score in the Jaguars' Week 11 win over the Chargers, Tuten has carried the ball a total of 15 times for 34 yards (2.27 yards per carry) and one touchdown over the last two weeks. He hasn't done enough to close the gap on Etienne as the team's clear RB1. Tuten isn't much more than a fantasy bench stash.
</div>

### 🟡 Justin Herbert (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> After Herbert injured his left, non-throwing hand during Sunday's win against the Raiders, he wore a glove with a significant amount of padding, but he still completed 15 of 20 passes for 151 yards, two touchdowns and one interception while recording three carries for eight yards. Coach Jim Harbaugh revealed afterward that Herbert sustained a broken bone in that hand, and Ian Rapoport of NFL Network reported its exact nature as a metacarpal fracture on Monday morning. Rapoport also noted that the Chargers intend to have Herbert available for Week 14 action, but how he fares on the practice field Thursday through Saturday ultimately will determine whether it's him or backup Trey Lance under center next Monday.
</div>

### 🟢 Tre' Harris (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Harris' four targets were third on the team, trailing Ladd McConkey (six) and Keenan Allen (five), as Harris saw one more target than Quentin Johnston. On a day Justin Herbert (hand) threw for just 151 yards on 20 attempts, McConkey was the team's leading receiving with just 39 yards. Second-round rookie Harris has secured 19 of 24 targets for 167 yards and one touchdown through 12 games. He's a situational WR4 for Los Angeles and would only have serious fantasy appeal if one of McConkey, Allen or Johnston went down with an injury.
</div>

### 🟢 Davante Adams (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Another week, another couple of red-zone TDs for the veteran wideout, who connected with Matthew Stafford for a four-yard score in the first quarter and a seven-yard strike in the second. Adams is up to a league-leading 14 touchdowns in 12 games in his first season with the Rams, the first time he's reached that mark since 2022, and his career high of 18 TDs from 2020 with the Packers is firmly in his sights. Adams will look to extend his current TD streak to six games in Week 14 against the Cardinals.
</div>

### 🟢 T.J. Hockenson (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Hockenson was the lone bright spot for Minnesota's passing offense after converting all of his targets into a team-high 59 yards. The 27-year-old tied his previous season best with six receptions, while the yardage did represent a new high-water mark in an otherwise disappointing campaign. With a 44-358-2 receiving line through 12 starts, Hockenson is providing the bare minimum at a shallow fantasy position for managers this season. That said, he offers little upside against the Commanders next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Drake Maye (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> About the only blemish on Maye's final line was the three sacks he took from the Giants' highly aggressive front, as the second-year signal-caller otherwise was in command from start to finish. He helped stake the Patriots to a 30-7 halftime lead with three- and 33-yard touchdown passes to Kayshon Boutte and Kyle Williams, respectively. Maye didn't have to do much in the second half, but he still netted the third-most passing yards in a game of his career. Maye now has thrown for at least 270 yards in four consecutive contests heading into a Week 15 home showdown against the Bills on Sunday, Dec. 14 following a Week 14 bye.
</div>

### 🟢 Alvin Kamara (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Out<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> out
</div>

### 🟢 Ricky Pearsall (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> High winds in Cleveland nerfed both passing attacks, and tight ends George Kittle and Harold Fannin ended up being the leading pass catchers for their respective squads. Pearsall hasn't been able to make much of an impact even in better conditions since returning from a knee injury however, and over the last three games he's managed just a 5-20-0 line on nine targets. The second-year wideout will get the 49ers' bye week to reset before taking on the Titans in Week 15.
