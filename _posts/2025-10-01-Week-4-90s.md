## Player Report

#### Lamar Jackson (QB)
**Injury Status:** Doubtful <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** The Ravens have been mum regarding the severity of the hamstring concern that forced Jackson out in the third quarter of Sunday's 37-20 loss to Kansas City, but the quarterback appears in line to miss his first game for injury-related reasons since 2022. According to the report, Jackson still plans to try and play through the injury this Sunday, but if he doesn't show enough improvement during the week, Cooper Rush would direct the offense against Houston. The expected loss of Jackson would be a major hit to the 1-3 Ravens in their matchup with the Texans' top-ranked scoring defense, which has allowed just 12.8 points per game through the first four weeks.
#### Dillon Gabriel (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Per Adam Schefter of ESPN, the rookie third-round pick will take over the top job from Joe Flacco, who will move into the No. 2 role, who led the Browns to a 1-3 record through the first four games of the season. Fellow rookie Shedeur Sanders, meanwhile, will remain third on the depth chart. Gabriel possesses more mobility than Flacco, who had been hit 19 times over the last two games according to Cleveland.com. The signal-caller's ability to provide some scrambling ability could prove to be helpful behind an offensive line that's been without both its starting tackles of late. That said, Gabriel could preside over a run-based attack headlined by rookie running back Quinshon Judkins, which could limit the quarterback's passing volume and his overall fantasy appeal.
#### Jameson Williams (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Williams has had a slow start to the season, with Sunday's performance marking the third time in four games that he's logged fewer than 45 receiving yards. This showing was particularly troubling because he led the team in targets, and the Lions seemingly made an effort to get him going. Per Colton Pouncy of The Athletic, Jared Goff took responsibility for some miscues when targeting Williams, saying he made poor reads, though Williams also dropped several passes.
#### Nico Collins (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Collins didn't dominate targets in his typical fashion Sunday, as four pass catchers logged between four and six targets. He still easily paced the Texans in yardage thanks to long gains of 37 and 22 yards to account for the majority of his production. Even with an underachieving Houston offense, Collins has found a way to be productive early this season by scoring a touchdown or topping 75 receiving yards in each of his last three games.
#### Jonathan Taylor (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Taylor turned in an efficient day on the ground, averaging 4.5 yards per carry with two gains of more than 10 yards. He also had a 53-yard touchdown nullified by a holding penalty, which held him under 100 yards rushing for the first time since Week 1. While Taylor's performance may have been underwhelming relative to his very high standards, his involvement as a receiver is noteworthy.  He has multiple catches in every game to begin 2025, and already has 13 receptions on the season after logging no more than 19 in either of the last two years.
#### Tre Tucker (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Tucker crashed back to reality after posting a career game with three touchdowns against the Commanders in Week 3. The versatile wideout remained involved with four touches, but Geno Smith's struggles may have contributed to Tucker's inability to break off a big gain Sunday. With expectations back in check, Tucker should resume his role as a fantasy dart throw when the Raiders visit the Colts next Sunday.
#### Brock Bowers (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Las Vegas' passing offense was anemic Sunday, generating just 117 yards through the air compared to 240 on the ground. Bowers managed to lead all Raiders' receiving options in receptions (five) and yardage (46), but it was RB Ashton Jeanty who benefited from both of Geno Smith's passing scores in the loss. It's safe to say that Bowers' sophomore season has been a disappointment through four weeks, with the star tight end averaging 40.7 yards in the three games following his promising Week 1 performance (5-103-0), although he may still be hampered slightly by a minor knee injury he picked up in the opener. Perhaps the 1-3 Raiders will look to feature its best receiving threat more often in a road matchup against the Colts next Sunday.
#### Jaylen Waddle (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Waddle finished tied for second in receptions and targets and as the runner-up in receiving yards on the night, but the bigger story is the 2021 first-round pick's projected expanded role moving forward. Tyreek Hill suffered what is being termed as a dislocated knee in the third quarter, meaning his season is almost certainly over. Consequently, Waddle, who posted a spectacular 104-1,015-6 line on 141 targets over 16 games back in his rookie 2021 campaign with Hill still on the Chiefs' roster, should elevate to the role of Tua Tagovailoa's top target moving forward. Waddle has yet to top five catches and 68 yards in a game this season, but it should only be a matter of time before he sets new single-game highs, perhaps as soon as a Week 5 road matchup against the Panthers.
#### Tua Tagovailoa (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Tagovailoa put together a relatively tame stat line in terms of his yardage, but the 2020 first-round pick generated his third straight two-touchdown-pass tally with a pair of scoring tosses to the debuting Darren Waller. Tagovailoa did lose Tyreek Hill to a gruesome knee injury, however, so he could be challenged to consistently offer above-average fantasy production moving forward without his No. 1 target. On the bright side, Tagovailoa demonstrated encouraging chemistry with Waller in their first game together and still has other speedy playmakers at his disposal, not to mention a favorable Week 5 road matchup against the Panthers on Sunday afternoon.
#### Jordan Addison (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Seeing his first action of the season after serving a three-game suspension, Addison had a quiet first half but then turned busted coverage into an 81-yard gain late in the fourth quarter that set up a Jalen Nailor TD reception, as the Vikings tried to rally from a 21-6 deficit. Addison figures to be productive again in Week 5, facing a Browns defense in London that has been far more vulnerable through the air than on the ground to begin the year.
#### Jordan Mason (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** The former 49ers wasn't able to repeat his Week 3 breakout versus Cincinnati against a tougher front seven, and Mason's longest run against Pittsburgh went for only nine yards. He also saw backup RB Zavier Scott catch a 16-yard TD in the fourth quarter as Minnesota tried to come back from a 21-6 deficit. Things won't get any easier for Mason in Week 5, as he'll take on a Browns defense in London that has already stuffed Derrick Henry and Josh Jacobs this season.
#### Garrett Wilson (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Wilson welcomed back QB Justin Fields (concussion) with open arms after the duo connected in the end zone for the second time this season (third overall for Wilson). The star wideout scored in spectacular fashion when he caught a high-point pass through a defender's arm while barely dragging both of his feet in bounds. He did have a second potential score erased by an offensive pass interference penalty. Wilson is now up to 311 yards and three touchdowns through four starts as the Jets continue to force feed him the ball in failed comeback attempts. Fantasy managers should treat the Ohio State product as a WR1 in another soft matchup versus the Cowboys on Sunday.
#### Jaylen Warren (RB)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** questionable
#### Calvin Austin III (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Austin checked out of the contest early in the fourth quarter and headed to the locker room after he appeared to land hard on the football while falling to the ground on a reception. If Austin's day is over, he'll finish with two catches for 13 yards on two targets to go with nine yards on two punt returns.
#### Jauan Jennings (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Jennings previously sat out the 49ers' Week 3 win over the Cardinals due to an ankle issue, and that injury plus a new rib concern is clouding his availability for Thursday's game against the Rams. After being gauged as a non-participant on Monday's estimated practice report, Jennings will be a spectator Tuesday in the 49ers' lone on-field session this week. The 49ers will decide Wednesday whether Jennings takes a designation into the Week 5 contest, or if he'll be ruled out in advance of the game. The San Francisco pass-catching corps could once again be shorthanded with Jennings, Ricky Pearsall (knee) and Jordan Watkins (calf) all sitting out Tuesday's practice, while tight end George Kittle (hamstring) and Brandon Aiyuk (knee) aren't on track to return from IR until at least Week 6.
#### Tyjae Spears (RB)
**Injury Status:** Injured Reserve <br>
**Lineup Slot:** IR <br>
**Details:** Spears suffered a high-ankle sprain during the preseason and started the season on injured reserve, but he's eligible to return to practice this week. It sounds like Spears is closing in on 100 percent health. Tony Pollard has played a whopping 89 percent of the Titans' offensive snaps as a true every-down back through four games and has averaged 18.5 touches per contest, totaling 316 yards from scrimmage and one touchdown. Spears should take some of that work once he returns, but Pollard likely will remain the lead back in Tennessee.
