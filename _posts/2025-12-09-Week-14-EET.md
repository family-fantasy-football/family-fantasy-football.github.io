## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟡 Drake London (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> London hasn't played or practiced since suffering a PCL sprain during Week 11 action, with coach Raheem Morris continuing  to refer to the wideout as "day-to-day" ahead of Thursday night's game against the Buccaneers. If London remains sidelined for the contest, Darnell Mooney, David Sills and Dylan Drummond would be in line to lead Atlanta's Week 15 WR corps.
</div>

### 🟢 Justice Hill (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Injured Reserve<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Hill was apparently injured in practice last week and was placed on injured reserve ahead of last Thursday night's game against the Bengals. He'll miss at least three more contests while on IR, but it sounds like he'll have a chance to return when eligible Week 17. Keaton Mitchell and Rasheen Ali will continue to handle backup duties behind Derrick Henry for the next few weeks.
</div>

### 🟡 Joshua Palmer (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 Courtland Sutton (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Broncos nicked and cut the Raiders' defense with a bunch of underneath routes Sunday, resulting in Sutton leading the team in targets, receptions and yardage on modest totals. The 29-year-old has been a steady fantasy option with per-game averages of 4.3 receptions and 59.5 yards to go along with five touchdowns across 13 starts. Sutton should continue providing a high floor for fantasy managers when the Broncos host the Packers next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Jakobi Meyers (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Meyers continued to solidify himself as Trevor Lawrence's favorite target, and he took advantage of Parker Washington's (hip) absence to log his first double-digit target performance since Week 2. He was inefficient with the opportunity, though he did manage a 14-yard touchdown reception late in the first quarter -- his most impactful play in the blowout win. Meyers has now found the end zone in three straight games and has at least six targets in each of his last four contests.
</div>

### 🟢 Trevor Lawrence (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Jaguars had a relatively easy win after Daniel Jones (Achilles) exited Sunday's game, but Lawrence managed to get his numbers early. He completed four passes of at least 25 yards, three of which came in the first two quarters, while also tallying touchdown throws of 14 and seven yards. While he attempted only 10 passes in the second half, Lawrence managed his third consecutive multi-score game while also reaching at least 225 passing yards for the third consecutive contest.
</div>

### 🟢 Hollywood Brown (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Brown has four or fewer targets in seven straight games, after getting five or more in each of Kansas City's first five contests. He's been efficient with his limited chances, but his snap shares have landed between 33 and 44 percent each week since Rashee Rice returned from suspension. Brown figures to continue in his part-time role Week 14 against Houston.
</div>

### 🟢 Aaron Jones Sr. (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Vikings' backfield was a near-even split between Jones and Jordan Mason, but the latter was able to get into the end zone in the second quarter on one of his 11 carries. Jones hasn't scored a TD himself in four straight games, amassing 190 rushing yards on 45 totes over that stretch while adding a 10-49-0 line on 15 targets, but he'll be in good position to end that drought in Week 15 versus a vulnerable Cowboys defense.
</div>

### 🟢 Saquon Barkley (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Barkley snapped out his recent funk in a big way when he took a pitch early in the fourth quarter down the sidelines for 52 yards to give Philadelphia its first lead of the evening. It was the second time this season that the star running back eclipsed 100 rushing yards, a feat he accomplished an astonishing 14 times (including the playoffs) during his impressive 2024 campaign. While Barkley's production has dropped off following the Eagles' Super Bowl run, he has still managed to generate over 1,000 yards from scrimmage with seven touchdowns for fantasy managers in 13 starts this year. Barkley will look to add to those totals in a favorable home matchup against the Raiders in Week 15.
</div>

### 🟢 George Kittle (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The veteran tight end led the Niners in receiving yards and tied Jauan Jennings for the team lead in catches on a day in which passing was difficult due to high winds in Cleveland. Kittle has caught at least four passes in six straight games, racking up a 33-371-4 line on 39 targets during that stretch. He'll get a breather during San Francisco's bye next week before taking on Tennessee in Week 15.
</div>

### 🟢 Brock Purdy (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> High winds in Cleveland made passing difficult, but Purdy was able to connect with Jauan Jennings for a seven-yard score in the fourth quarter after the QB ran in a two-yard touchdown of his own in the third. The rushing score was Purdy's first in three starts since returning from a toe injury and is the best sign yet that he's fully healthy. He'll get a bye to rest up next week before the 49ers host the Titans in Week 15.
</div>

### 🟢 Rashid Shaheed (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> It was a slow scoring affair in the first half, but Shaheed turned Sunday's game on its head with a 100-yard kickoff return for a touchdown to open the second half. Week 14 was his best performance as a Seahawk, as he finished second in catches, targets and receiving yards behind Jaxon Smith-Njigba (seven catches on 10 targets for 92 yards and two touchdowns). Through 14 regular-season games (nine with the Saints and five with the Seahawks), Shaheed has accumulated 52 catches (on 82 targets) for 603 yards and two touchdowns
</div>

### 🟢 Tony Pollard (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Pollard churned out a new single-game career-best rushing yardage total in the Titans' second win of the season, with a 65-yard touchdown run late in the first quarter serving as the highlight of his stellar afternoon. The veteran back went on to add a 32-yard scoring scamper late in the third quarter to finish with his first multi-TD tally of the season. Pollard had topped 90 rushing yards only once this season before Sunday, so the breakout against what had been a tough Browns defense was particularly unforeseen. Pollard will look to author a fitting encore in a Week 15 road clash against the 49ers next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Zach Ertz (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Out<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> With Ertz now slated to miss the rest of the season, John Bates, Ben Sinnott and Colson Yankoff are in line to handle the Commanders' TE duties down the stretch. Ertz thus finishes his 2025 campaign with 50 catches (on 72 targets) for 504 yards and four TDs in 13 games.
