## Player Report

#### David Njoku (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Njoku tied for second in receptions and finished third in receiving yards on the afternoon for the Browns. Fellow tight end Harold Fannin still outpaced Njoku by one catch and eight receiving yards, however, although both players saw the same number of targets. It appears each will retain meaningful roles in the offense for the time being, and Njoku will head into a Week 3 home matchup against the Packers with a 7-77-0 receiving line on 11 targets.
#### Evan Engram (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Engram returned from the calf injury he sustained in Week 1, but he played only 43 percent of offensive snaps and worked behind Adam Trautman (62 percent), who brought in all three of his targets for 10 yards and a score. It's possible Engram gets more involved in Week 3 against the Chargers as he improves his game fitness, but even before being injured in the opener he played just one snap, and the veteran chain-mover may not be as entrenched as the team's No. 1 tight end as expected, with Trautman offering superior blocking ability. Fantasy managers may want to wait until Engram proves he's earned a larger snap share before relying on him.
#### Brian Thomas Jr. (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Thomas wasn't listed on Jacksonville's injury report leading up to Sunday's loss, so his wrist injury could have been sustained over the weekend. An injury would somewhat explain Thomas' inefficiency versus Cincinnati, as he secured just four of 12 targets for 49 yards during the narrow loss and at times seemed to visibly shy away from contact. Coen said Thomas "knows he needs to have a great week of practice," per Mia O'Brien of 1010 XL 92.5 FM Jacksonville radio, so fantasy managers will need to monitor whether the Year 2 wideout is listed on Wednesday's first injury report of Week 3 ahead of Sunday's matchup against the Texans.
#### Isiah Pacheco (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Pacheco struggled to find any running room against the Eagles' front seven, averaging a paltry 2.2 yards per tote in another forgettable fantasy showing. Things got so bleak that QB Patrick Mahomes wound up finishing as Kansas City's leading rusher on just seven attempts (66 yards and a touchdown). The 0-2 Chiefs' offense is in shambles to begin the season, but Pacheco retains the highest fantasy potential of any of the team's backfield options heading into next Sunday's tilt against the Giants.
#### Ladd McConkey (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** The second-year target narrowly missed out on a bigger fantasy day if not for some timely tackling by the Raiders, but McConkey was simply an afterthought compared to Keenan Allen (5-61-1 on seven targets) and Quentin Johnston (3-71-1 on seven targets) on the evening. McConkey saw fewer than five targets in just two games all of last season, so while the game script suggests the speedy target simply wasn't needed in this one, the lack of volume could be something to monitor in future weeks.
#### De'Von Achane (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** The Dolphins were already down 12-0 at the end of one quarter, which immediately put Achane in catch-up mode when it came to consistent rushing opportunities. As his final line indicates, those remained relatively sparse overall, but game script did work in his favor when it came to his pass-catching role. Achane finished as the Dolphins' leader in both receptions and targets, while finishing second to only Tyreek Hill in receiving yards. Achane also went in for his second receiving touchdown in as many games to open the season when he recorded an impressive 29-yard grab late in the first half, and he'll be slated for a key two-way role again during what is already essentially a must-win scenario for the Dolphins in a Week 3 Thursday night road matchup against the Bills.
#### Darius Slayton (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Slayton was shut out in the first half but salvaged a decent final line with 61 receiving yards after halftime. Most of that production came on a 52-yard connection with Russell Wilson midway through the third quarter. Despite that big play, it doesn't bode well for his place in New  York's WR pecking order that Slayton saw just three targets despite playing all but one of the team's offensive snaps, especially since Russell Wilson aired it out 41 times and gained 450 yards on 30 completions. It was already a given that Malik Nabers would hog the wideout targets for the Giants this season, but it's telling that Wan'Dale Robinson garnered 10 looks of his own and nabbed eight receptions for a career-high 142 yards Sunday. With just five targets (and two catches) through two weeks, Slayton doesn't appear to have established much chemistry with Wilson thus far.
#### Wan'Dale Robinson (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** During a wild seesaw affair in which Russell Wilson threw for 450 yards, Robinson set a new career high that shattered his previous best of 100 yards, which he recorded in Week 11 of his rookie season in 2022. The possession receiver has had a strong start to the current campaign, posting a 14-197-1 line on 18 targets, and if the Giants fall behind early he could be busy again in Week 3 against Kansas City.
#### Aaron Rodgers (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Rodgers didn't get much help from his pass catchers, but he still had a letdown performance in Week 2. His lone touchdown came on a lofted jump ball to DK Metcalf late in the first half from two yards away, and he also recorded three completions of at least 20 yards -- though Rodgers still managed only 6.2 yards per attempt. While that was a significant departure from Week 1, Rodgers was let down by his pass catchers on a few occasions, most notably on a pass in the end zone that was deflected by Calvin Austin on a pass intended for Pat Freiermuth that was ultimately intercepted. With a subpar offensive line and below-average playmakers around him, it's fair to expect more mediocre fantasy performances from Rodgers moving forward.
#### Baker Mayfield (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Mayfield was in danger of a second straight sub-200-yard performance to open the season, but the veteran signal-caller came alive on Tampa Bay's game-winning drive. He took the Bucs a total of 80 yards on 11 plays in just over two minutes, completing seven of nine passes while adding a 15-yard scramble before Rachaad White capped off the march with a two-yard touchdown run. In the second quarter, Mayfield also connected with Emeka Egbuka on a 15-yard scoring pass for the rookie's third touchdown over the first two games. Despite completing just 60.0 percent of his passes through the first pair of contests, Mayfield also will take a sparkling 5:0 TD:INT into a Week 3 home matchup against the Jets on Sunday afternoon.
#### Mike Evans (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Evans comfortably led the Buccaneers in targets and also set the pace in receiving yards, albeit by a smaller margin. The Texans did a good job overall disrupting the rhythm between Evans and Baker Mayfield, leading to Evans' second straight five-catch, sub-60-yard effort to open the season. The successful QB-WR duo will look to author their first breakout performance of 2025 when the Buccaneers host the Jets in a Week 3 matchup on Sunday afternoon.
#### Jayden Daniels (QB)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Quinn added that Daniels underwent an MRI on Friday, and he's "already begun his return to play process with us. ... What does that mean for Sunday [against the Raiders]? I can't tell you that now. I'll share more when we get to Wednesday." After Ian Rapoport of NFL Network reported earlier Monday that Daniels has a sprained knee, Quinn wouldn't go as far, only calling it a "knee injury," per Commanders writer Ben Standig. Wednesday's practice report will reveal whether Daniels handles any practice reps to start Week 3 prep, but if he isn't able to go this weekend, backup Marcus Mariota is on hand to lead the Commanders offense.
