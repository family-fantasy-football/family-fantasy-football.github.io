## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Tyler Allgeier (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Falcons trailed for most of Sunday's loss, which led to only 14 rushing attempts compared to 37 passes for Michael Penix. A pass-heavy game script means a muted role for Allgeier, who saw double-digit touches in four of Atlanta's first five games. However, over the past three games, the backup running back has totaled only 10 rushing attempts.
</div>

### 🟢 David Njoku (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Browns are on bye in Week 9, giving the organization a chance to reassess, evaluate and potentially make changes after a 2-6 start to the season. Njoku, 29, stands out as a possible trade chip for the Browns, given that he's in the final year of his contract in addition to the fact that Cleveland has a promising rookie tight end on its roster in Harold Fannin. Njoku is coming off a productive outing in the Browns' Week 8 loss to the Patriots on Sunday, when he caught four of five targets for 37 yards and a touchdown. He notably played eight fewer snaps than Fannin, though the blowout nature of the contest may have been a factor in the Browns' decision to scale back Njoku's playing time.
</div>

### 🟢 Evan Engram (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Engram was unable to get anything going in Week 9, as he played second fiddle to fellow tight end Adam Trautman against the Texans. The 31-year-old Engram played 51 percent of Denver's offensive snaps Sunday, reaching above a 50 percent snap share for just the second time this season. Even so, it was Trautman who saw the majority of work at tight end, playing 73 percent of snaps and catching both of his targets for 25 yards. The Denver tight end position is seemingly one to avoid for fantasy purposes, as neither Engram nor Trautman are reliable options, and those hoping Engram could have a strong year in head coach Sean Payton's system have likely already moved on. The veteran will remain difficult to trust when the Broncos host the Raiders in Week 10.
</div>

### 🟢 Troy Franklin (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The second-year wideout was Bo Nix's top option on the day in terms of targets, but Franklin had trouble getting open against a stingy Houston secondary. It's the second time in the last three weeks Franklin's gotten double-digit looks from his college teammate Nix, and on the season he's put together a 37-385-4 line on 64 targets, making him more of a 1B alongside Courtland Sutton than the Broncos' No. 2 receiver. Franklin should find more room to operate in Week 10 against the Raiders.
</div>

### 🟡 Brian Thomas Jr. (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Though high-ankle sprains almost always cause players to miss at least one game, Thomas appears to have a realistic chance at avoiding an absence since his injury looks to be of the mild variety. Even so, Thomas' practice activity is expected to be affected this week, and unless he upgrades to full participation by Friday, he'll likely take a designation into Sunday. In response to seeing its receiver depth take significant hits of late with Travis Hunter (knee) moving to injured reserve last week, Tim Patrick (knee) sitting out the Week 9 win and Thomas and Dyami Brown (concussion) both exiting the contest early, the Jaguars acquired Jakobi Meyers from the Raiders on Tuesday. Meyers is likely to eventually settle in as the Jaguars' primary option in the slot while Hunter is out for at least three more games, though Meyers could initially see more reps on the perimeter this Sunday if Thomas is unable to play.
</div>

### 🟢 Isiah Pacheco (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Out<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> out
</div>

### 🟢 Rashee Rice (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Rice extended his scoring streak to three games since returning from suspension in Week 7. The 25-year-old used his legs to hit pay dirt this time around after hauling in three touchdown receptions over his previous two contests. While the Chiefs were unable to claim victory over an AFC rival Sunday, Rice continued establishing himself as QB Patrick Mahomes' favorite weapon by finishing two targets ahead of Travis Kelce (4-66-0). Fantasy managers will be forced to fill Rice's WR1 production with Kansas City on a bye in Week 10. The red-hot wideout will resume play against the Broncos on Nov. 16.
</div>

### 🟢 Tyler Lockett (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Making his Raiders debut, Lockett served as Geno Smith's WR3 behind Jakobi Meyers and Tre Tucker, but the 33-year-old receiver logged only 19 offensive snaps while tight ends Brock Bowers and Michael Mayer were heavily featured in two-TE sets. Nonetheless, Lockett immediately played ahead of rookie Jack Bech, and Dont'e Thornton was ruled inactive as a healthy scratch before the contest. Las Vegas might want to lend additional reps to Bech and Thornton as the season wears on, but for now, Lockett appears to be the more trusted option.
</div>

### 🟢 Ladd McConkey (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Chargers didn't hold as comfortable a lead as expected in the game, but they were still very run-heavy in the second half. Between the game plan and a relatively flat distribution of targets, McConkey turned in a modest performance and his lowest yardage total since Week 5. While it was underwhelming production, McConkey still led the team in targets. He should be able to bounce back in Week 10 against Pittsburgh.
</div>

### 🟢 De'Von Achane (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Achane gained exactly 67 rushing yards for the second straight game, although he was more efficient Thursday with an average of 4.8 yards per carry than he had been against the Falcons on Sunday (3.7 YPC). Achane was also once again heavily involved as a pass catcher, tying his third-highest reception total of the campaign. The versatile back continues to boast a safe floor irrespective of the inconsistencies of the Dolphins offense, and he'll be teed up for a favorable matchup in a Week 10 home matchup against the Bills on Sunday, Nov. 9.
</div>

### 🟢 Darius Slayton (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Slayton led the Giants in receiving yards despite making four fewer catches than Wan'Dale Robinson, who finished with only 46 receiving yards. Slayton will likely continue to play a significant role in Week 10 against the Bears as the top downfield target for Jaxson Dart in the injury-riddled Giants offense.
</div>

### 🟢 Wan'Dale Robinson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Robinson led the Giants in targets and catches but averaged just 5.1 yards per reception and fell 16 receiving yards shy of Darius Slayton's team-high total. Though Robinson rarely catches the ball more than a few yards downfield, his significant target share from Jaxson Dart gives Robinson a high fantasy floor, especially in PPR formats. Heading into a Week 10 road game against the Bears, Robinson has recorded at least six receptions in five of nine games.
</div>

### 🟢 Aaron Rodgers (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Steelers forced five turnovers, which created several short fields for Rodgers and the offense to work with. They struggled to find much rhythm early, as Rodgers managed to throw for only 108 yards despite attempting 22 passes in the first half. He didn't make mistakes in the win and managed to connect with Pat Freiermuth for a 12-yard touchdown, but Rodgers failed to complete a pass of at least 20 yards for the first time this season while averaging a season-worst 5.8 yards per attempt. This also marked the first time he's failed to throw for multiple touchdowns since Week 4.
</div>

### 🟢 Jayden Daniels (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Out<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> According to JP Finlay of NBC Sports Washington, Daniels avoided any fractures to his non-throwing arm when he sustained a gruesome-looking injury when he was sacked midway through the fourth quarter of the blowout loss. The Commanders are still in the process of collecting more information on Daniels' injury, and Quinn anticipates that the team will have a clearer timeline for the signal-caller's return by Wednesday or Thursday. At this stage, the Commanders aren't ready to rule Daniels out for the season, but he appears to be a strong bet to be moved to injured reserve, which would keep him sidelined for at least four games. Marcus Mariota came on in relief of Daniels against the Seahawks and is in line to make his fourth start of the season in this Sunday's game versus the Lions.
