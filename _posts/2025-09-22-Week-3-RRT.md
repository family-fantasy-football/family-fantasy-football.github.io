## Player Report

#### Trey McBride (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** McBride led all Cardinals in targets and receptions while hauling in Kyler Murray's only touchdown pass in Sunday's narrow loss. The 25-year-old McBride didn't waste much time cracking the end zone this season after needing 15 starts to catch his first touchdown in 2024. McBride is proving to be a consistent fantasy producer at the tight end position, carrying a 17-182-1 receiving line into a Week 4 matchup against the Seahawks on Thursday Night Football.
#### DeAndre Hopkins (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** "With every day, his packages (on offense) are going to continue to grow," Monken said of Hopkins, who logged a 35 percent snap share Week 1 and an 18 percent share Week 2. Despite the modest playing time, Hopkins caught both of his targets and scored in both contests. While Zay Flowers should continue to see steady volume and Rashod Bateman maintains a key role, any uptick in terms of workload would help make Hopkins less TD-dependent, while working in a WR corps that also includes Tylan Wallace and Devontez Walker. For now, however, Hopkins profiles as a hit-or-miss fantasy lineup option ahead of Monday night's game against the Lions.
#### Chuba Hubbard (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Hubbard continued to see his workload shrink relative to Rico Dowdle, with Hubbard earning 19 touches to Dowdle's 11. That's still plenty of volume to be productive, but the split cost Hubbard a potential touchdown when Dowdle handled an entire drive early in the fourth quarter that concluded with him finding the end zone. The positive news for Hubbard is that he was still efficient with his touches by consistently picking up chunk gains, and he remains entrenched as the lead back in Carolina.
#### Ja'Marr Chase (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Chase was part of the collateral damage of a miserable day for the Bengals on both sides of the ball. The aggressive Vikings defense capitalized on Jake Browning's presence under center to collect two interceptions, three sacks and three fumble recoveries, but Chase still managed to tie for the team lead in receptions and also set the pace in receiving yards and targets. The star wideout's production will naturally be hard to trust on a week-to-week basis for as long as Joe Burrow (IR, toe) remains out, but Chase will undoubtedly remain heavily involved in an unenviable Week 4 road matchup against the Broncos on Monday night, Sept. 29.
#### David Montgomery (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Montgomery and backfield mate Jahmyr Gibbs each recorded a rushing touchdown, and Montgomery also had just one fewer carry than his star teammate, albeit while compiling 37 fewer rushing yards. Montgomery still averaged 5.2 yards per carry, however, and he rang up his first TD of the season on a one-yard run late in the first quarter. Through two games, it appears the backs will continue to operate in a fairly close timeshare, but they face a thorny matchup in a Week 3 road trip to face the Ravens on Monday night, Sept. 22.
#### Dalton Schultz (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Schultz was allotted a season-high six targets, as the Texans made a concerted effort to get the passing game going. C.J. Stroud's 38 throws were the most in three games, but the aerial attack mustered just 184 yards (4.6 yards per attempt). The passing volume meant opportunities for Schultz still existed even with the season debut of No. 2 wideout Christian Kirk (eight targets). At 0-3 and getting very little from Stroud, the Texans might consider a heavier run-based attack, which would impact all receivers.
#### Josh Downs (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The Colts had a relatively flat target distribution, but Downs still slipped behind each of Michael Pittman, Alec Pierce and Tyler Warren for opportunities in the passing game. Downs managed an impressive 29-yard catch early in the first quarter to set up a field goal, but he now has only two catches in two of three games to begin the campaign.
#### Travis Etienne Jr. (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Etienne found running room at a premium against a talented Texans front, but he was able to rescue fantasy managers from a washout by recording a 10-yard touchdown run with just under two minutes remaining. The score, Etienne's first on the ground in 2025, delivered what would prove to be the game-winning points. Etienne has seen his rushing yardage total drop in each of the last two contests after opening the season with a 143-yard effort against the Panthers, a trend he'll aim to reverse in a Week 4 road interconference clash against the 49ers.
#### Matthew Stafford (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Stafford and the Rams' offense left a lot on the table despite scoring 26 points. He threw an interception on the opening possession, then had a pair of drives stall inside the red zone in the first half. The end result was that Stafford averaged only 5.9 yards per attempt, though he also had some positives in the performance. Most notably, he connected with Davante Adams on a deep 44-yard score late in the first quarter, and he also found Kyren Williams for a 10-yard score on the opening drive of the third quarter. Stafford has multiple touchdowns in each of his last two games, and he should have the chance to bounce back from an efficiency perspective in Week 4 against the Colts.
#### Rhamondre Stevenson (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** After a very impressive Week 2 performance, Stevenson was largely to blame for New England's Week 3 loss, losing the ball on the first possession to set up Pittsburgh's first TD of the day, and then fumbling again on the Steelers' one-yard line in the third quarter. The Patriots' running game struggled as a whole Sunday, with QB Drake Maye leading the team in rushing yards and Antonio Gibson also losing a fumble. Stevenson's struggles holding onto the ball could open the door for rookie  TreVeyon Henderson to see a much bigger role in Week 4 against the Panthers.
#### Spencer Rattler (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Rattler failed to recreate the three-touchdown performance we saw from him in Week 2, resulting in numbers closer to his pedestrian game against Atlanta to open the season. The Saints were outmatched from the jump, falling behind by 32 points at halftime. Things got so bad that rookie backup Tyler Shough saw the field in garbage time. It wouldn't be surprising to see the quarterbacks flip roles at some point this season for the 0-3 Saints. For now, Rattler figures to continue starting for New Orleans when the team travels to Buffalo next Sunday.
#### A.J. Brown (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** The Eagles had taken to the air sparingly in the first two weeks of this season, and Brown entered the game with 35 total yards from scrimmage. However, Philadelphia fell behind early against the Rams, and Jalen Hurts had to attempt 32 passes in a comeback effort, allowing Brown to get more opportunity. He turned that into several highlight-worthy plays, including a 38-yard catch deep down the right sideline early in the third quarter and a nine-yard touchdown catch one possession later. It's no surprise that Brown was productive when given the chance, and the Eagles could be pushed once again in a Week 4 matchup against the Bucs.
#### Cooper Kupp (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Kupp reverted to his low-usage role after commanding nine targets in a Week 2 win over Las Vegas. The veteran wideout finished third in targets, receptions and yardage for the Seahawks behind Jaxon Smith-Njigba (5-96-1) and Tory Horton (3-32-1). Perhaps Kupp can get more involved in Week 4 against a familiar NFC West opponent in the Cardinals on Thursday Night Football.
#### Sam Darnold (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Darnold had an easy day at the office Sunday, generating most of his statistical production in a lopsided first half of action. Things got so out of hand in the second half that Seattle was able to get both of its backup quarterbacks on the field during garbage time. This was Darnold's finest performance as a member of the Seahawks, and he is now averaging 221.0 passing yards to go along with four touchdowns and two interceptions through three starts in 2025. Darnold is looking like a mid-level fantasy option heading into a Week 4 matchup against the Cardinals on Thursday Night Football.
#### Jaxon Smith-Njigba (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Smith-Njigba was battling an illness that he had to power through in order to suit up Sunday. Fantasy managers were grateful that he did after Sam Darnold dialed up his No. 1 option for a 12-yard score on Seattle's opening possession. It was Smith-Njigba's first trip to the end zone in 2025, complementing healthy averages of 7.3 receptions and 107.7 yards through three contests. JSN is coming into his own as the Seahawks prepare to face the Cardinals in a matchup of 2-1 NFC West squads on Thursday Night Football in Week 4.
