## Player Report

#### Chuba Hubbard (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Hubbard has established himself as the clear No. 1 option leading the Panthers' rushing attack this season, and he rushed 26 times for 92 yards and one touchdown versus Philadelphia, but there had been an assumption that Brooks' involvement would ramp up down the stretch. With the rookie second-round pick having re-torn his right ACL, though, Carolina's roster no longer features anyone even resembling a threat to Hubbard's dominant share of reps. Raheem Blackshear (chest) is considered day-to-day, while veteran Miles Sanders (ankle) won't be eligible to come off IR until Week 16 against Arizona, at the earliest. Head coach Dave Canales said practice-squad player Mike Boone currently is in line to handle the No. 2 role behind Hubbard at practice and potentially Week 15 versus Dallas, per Steve Reed of the Associated Press.
#### Keenan Allen (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Allen overcame a minor ankle injury during the practice week in order to suit up for Sunday's eventual loss. The seasoned veteran posted vanilla numbers on the heels of his two most-productive games. Allen has underwhelmed in Chicago outside of the two aforementioned performances, averaging just 3.7 receptions and 34.7 yards in nine other games this season. Perhaps the 32-year-old has finally lost a step in his 12th year, or his down numbers could simply be the result of the Bears' overall ineptitude on offense. Whatever the case, Allen checks in as a middling fantasy option ahead of next Monday's road tilt against the Vikings.
#### David Njoku (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Njoku led the Browns in targets and receptions, though he was held to short yardage for much of the game. He broke that trend with a leaping 15-yard touchdown grab midway through the fourth quarter, and he now has three touchdowns across his last two games. Njoku has also emerged as a clear favorite target of Jameis Winston, combining to command 30 targets in that same two-contest span while seeing at least nine opportunities in three of his last four contests.
#### Brandin Cooks (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Cooks' limitations in Thursday's practice were primarily rest-related as he gets eased back in ahead of his second game back from a two-month absence due to a knee injury. Barring a setback Saturday, the veteran wideout should head into Monday's matchup with the struggling Bengals secondary sans an injury designation.
#### Courtland Sutton (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Sutton led the Broncos in both targets and receptions Monday, but he was second to Marvin Mims after the latter broke off a 93-yard touchdown in the high-scoring affair. The 29-year-old Sutton has posted three 100-plus-yard performances over the last six weeks, chipping in three touchdowns over that span as well. With Denver entering a bye week, Sutton will have to wait until Sunday, Dec. 15 against Indianapolis in order to continue his current tear.
#### Bo Nix (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Nix turned in mixed results in Monday's thrilling victory, throwing his 17th touchdown in addition to his seventh and eighth interceptions of the season. The rookie standout didn't have his best game as a rusher, either, but his 294 passing yards was his second-highest total through 13 starts. Nix has been progressing well since enduring a slow start to the campaign, making him a viable fantasy option coming out of the upcoming bye against the Colts on Sunday, Dec. 15.
#### Jayden Reed (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Reed played 50 percent of snaps, which ties for his lowest share this season but doesn't fall outside the normal range. It's the seventh time he's logged 50-59 percent of snaps, as he still doesn't get much playing time in formations with fewer than three wide receivers. Reed has just one game all year with more than six targets, making him highly dependent on touchdowns and big plays, especially relative to other WRs that primarily man the slot. He has 12 targets and 73 receiving yards over the past four games, but with three of his eight catches in that span going for touchdowns. Reed will be a high-risk, high-reward lineup option once again Week 15 at Seattle, facing a defense that often uses top cornerback Devon Witherspoon in the slot.
#### Anthony Richardson (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** That two-point conversion came with 12 seconds left in the fourth quarter, after Richardson had led a five-minute scoring drive that he capped with a three-yard TD pass to Alec Pierce on fourth down. A poor completion rate is simply part of the package with the second-year QB at this stage of his development, but there's no denying Richardson's athletic upside, and since reclaiming the starting job for the Colts he's produced six touchdowns (three passing, three rushing) in three games. The Colts are on bye in Week 14, giving Richardson time to recharge ahead of the team's final push for the playoffs.
#### Isiah Pacheco (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Pacheco returned to the clear-cut lead role in his second game back from a fractured fibula, as Kareem Hunt and Samaje Perine combined for just eight touches. After posting 189 scrimmage yards and a touchdown in two games prior to the injury, Pacheco has 110 total yards without a score in two games since returning. Pacheco will look to pick up the pace in Week 15 against the Browns.
#### Tre Tucker (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Tucker was one of four Raiders pass catchers to earn at least five targets Sunday, but he was by far the least productive with his looks, producing only seven yards on two receptions. The speedster remains a boom-or-bust option in Week 15 against a Falcons secondary that just allowed Vikings wideouts Justin Jefferson and Jordan Addison to combine for a 15-265-5 receiving line on 19 targets, though Tucker may be catching passes from quarterback Desmond Ridder after Aidan O'Connell suffered a bone bruise to his left leg Sunday.
#### Jordan Addison (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Addison led the Vikings across the board in receptions, receiving yards and targets, narrowly edging Justin Jefferson by one in the first two categories. The second-year wideout's season had been considered largely disappointing until three games ago, when Addison turned in an 8-162-1 line against the Bears at Soldier Field. Sunday's performance saw Addison establish a new single-game career high in touchdown catches with scoring receptions of 49, 11 and six yards, and it also featured a season-high-tying reception tally and a new high-water mark in targets. Given his recent body of work, Addison will head into a Week 15 divisional showdown against the Bears on Monday night, Dec. 16 with plenty of momentum.
#### Derek Carr (QB)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Rizzi noted the fracture to Carr's left, non-throwing hand currently doesn't appear as though it will require surgery, Ross Jackson of WWL Louisiana reports. The interim head coach also said it's possible that Carr could start Sunday's game against the Commanders even if he's unable to practice this week, per Sean Fazende of Fox 8 New Orleans. It would be a tall task, though, for the veteran signal-caller to both clear the five-step concussion protocol fully and reach a level of comfort with his injured hand to handle full contact and play Week 15. If Carr isn't able to suit up versus Washington, starting duties will fall to one of Jake Haener or Spencer Rattler.
#### Pat Freiermuth (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Russell Wilson took to the air only 26 times, leading to limited volume for all of Pittsburgh's pass catchers. Freiermuth made the most of his chances, highlighted by long gains of 21 and 20 yards -- the latter of which went for a touchdown. He has now found the end zone in three of his last five games and has at least 45 receiving yards in three straight contests after reaching that mark just once in his first 10 matchups.
#### DK Metcalf (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Metcalf finished second in targets behind running back Zach Charbonnet (seven) while checking in third in receiving yards behind Charbonnet and fellow wideout Jaxon Smith-Njigba. The 27-year-old Metcalf's modest production out of the team's Week 10 bye may have fantasy managers concerned, but the wideout has maintained a high floor of 4.8 receptions and 61.0 yards during the mild four-game cold spell. Keep faith in Metcalf, as the Seahawks may require more from their receivers at home against Green Bay next Sunday.
#### Zach Charbonnet (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Starter Kenneth Walker (ankle/calf) was unable to suit up for Sunday's crucial NFC West battle, opening the door for Charbonnet to make his third start of the campaign. The sophomore backup wound up setting new career highs in both rushing (134) and receiving yards (59) while punching in a pair of touchdowns. Five of Charbonnet's seven touchdown rushes have come in three spot-starts for Walker this season, highlighting the major fantasy value that can be unearthed in those scenarios. Fantasy managers who missed out on Sunday's point bonanza should monitor Walker's status for Week 15 before putting in large bids for Seattle's talented backup ahead of next Sunday's tilt against Green Bay.
#### Rachaad White (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** White's backfield mate Bucky Irving exited the game for good in the first half with a back injury, and White was able to take advantage with a season-high rushing yardage total. The game marked the third-year pro's second straight efficient effort, as he'd also recorded 76 yards on 11 carries, albeit with the help of a big run in overtime, in a Week 13 win over the Panthers. White added his third rushing touchdown of the season on a three-yard run in the fourth quarter, a score preceded by a five-yard TD grab in the opening period. White's fantasy prospects are on an upswing irrespective of Irving's status going into a Week 15 road matchup against the Chargers.
#### Calvin Ridley (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Ridley dominated opportunity in the passing game, as no other Titans pass catcher saw more than four targets. That didn't lead to a great stat line, and Ridley ultimately needed a long 30-yard reception midway through the fourth quarter to have even a mediocre performance. He also drew negative attention for stepping out of bounds on a third-down play while seemingly having the chance to turn upfield to get past the sticks. The Titans failed to convert on the next play, ending Tennessee's best chance to win the game. Ridley has been held below 60 receiving yards in three of his last four matchups.
