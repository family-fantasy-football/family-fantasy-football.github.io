## 🏥 Player Report

### 🔴 Emari Demercado (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Doubtful<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> doubtful
</div>

### 🟢 Michael Penix Jr. (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Injured Reserve<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Atlanta is still evaluating Penix to determine the severity of the left knee injury he sustained in Sunday's 30-27 overtime loss to the Panthers, but with his move to IR, the second-year quarterback will miss at least four games. Kirk Cousins is slated to take over as the Falcons' new starting signal-caller in Penix's absence. Ian Rapoport of NFL Network previously relayed that Penix aggravated an existing bone bruise and knee sprain while also suffering damage to the ACL in his left knee. During his college career, the 25-year-old underwent surgeries to address ACL tears in his right knee in 2018 and 2020, and he also suffered season-ending shoulder injuries in 2019 and 2021.
</div>

### 🟢 Rome Odunze (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Odunze caught only one of five first-half targets but still led the Bears with 24 first-half receiving yards, accounting for a third of Caleb Williams' 72 passing yards before halftime. Williams was marginally more productive in the second half but directed only one pass at Odunze. Despite the modest volume, Odunze finished four receiving yards shy of Cole Kmet's team lead Sunday. Heading into a Week 12 home game against the Steelers, Odunze leads the Bears across the board with 39 catches for 600 receiving yards and six receiving touchdowns on 75 targets through 10 games.
</div>

### 🟢 Caleb Williams (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Williams finished without a touchdown pass for the third time in his last five starts while completing fewer than 60 percent of his passes for the sixth time in his last seven outings. He was credited with his league-leading fifth fourth-quarter comeback win of the season, but Williams didn't do much to earn this one, handing the ball off three times after Devin Duvernay's kickoff return got the Bears in range for a game-winning Cairo Santos field goal on the final play. Williams has an opportunity to pick up the pace as a passer in Week 12 against the inconsistent Steelers secondary.
</div>

### 🟢 D'Andre Swift (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> For the second consecutive week since returning from a groin injury, Swift worked as the top option in Chicago's backfield but was kept out of the end zone while backup Kyle Monangai scored a rushing touchdown. Swift has rushed for at least 80 yards in four of his last five appearances heading into a Week 12 home game against the Steelers, so he remains a reliable source of yardage despite Monangai's involvement by the goal line.
</div>

### 🟢 Travis Kelce (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> With his 21-yard TD reception in the fourth quarter, the veteran tight end became Kansas City's all-time franchise leader in touchdowns with 84 for his career, passing Priest Holmes. Kelce has produced more than 90 yards with a touchdown in two of the last three games, and on the season he sports a 50-631-4 line on 66 targets through 10 contests, keeping him on pace to deliver his first 1,000-yard campaign since 2022. Kelce will look to keep rolling in Week 12 against the Colts.
</div>

### 🟢 Hunter Henry (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Henry had been held to a season-low-tying one reception Sunday against the Buccaneers, but he bounced back by tying his second-highest catch total of the campaign. The veteran tight end also posted his second-highest yardage tally in the last six contests, while Thursday's targets tied for the most he'd seen since Week 3. Henry will take a 34-422-4 line on 53 targets into a Week 12 home matchup against the Bengals on Sunday, Nov. 23.
</div>

### 🟢 Chris Olave (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The fourth-year wideout put together his best performance of the season in terms of yardage, capped by a 62-yard TD in the second quarter. Olave failed to see double-digit targets for only the fourth time in 2025, but he's showing some good early chemistry with rookie QB Tyler Shough, who was making his second career start. Olave will take a 60-664-4 line on 94 targets through 10 games into the Saints' bye, before facing the Falcons in Week 12.
</div>

### 🟢 Will Shipley (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> One week after Shipley touched the ball a season-high six times on offense, he went an entire game without a single touch, something that's happened on two other occasions already this year. He only played seven offensive snaps, one fewer than fellow backup running back Tank Bigsby.
</div>

### 🟢 DeVonta Smith (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jalen Hurts made a concerted effort to feed disgruntled WR A.J. Brown (11 targets) the football in the win, leaving scraps for the remaining Philadelphia receivers in Sunday's low-scoring affair. Smith finished in a tie with Dallas Goedert for second in team targets, but the former's season-worst 20 percent catch rate was the main reason behind his struggles. Even with Sunday's dud, Smith still boasts an impressive 49-665-3 stat line in 10 starts this year.
</div>

### 🟢 Jalen Hurts (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Hurts turned in a stat line similar to what he was producing out of the gates this season: low-volume passing totals with almost all of his value coming from his legs. Fantasy mangers would prefer if the 26-year-old could utilize both of his elite skills on a weekly basis, but at least his sporadic rushing scores have helped limit the signal-caller from truly having a bad game through 10 starts. Adding it all up, Hurts is completing 69 percent of his passes while accounting for 22 total touchdowns to just three turnovers. Those elite metrics coupled with a soft matchup against the Cowboys next Sunday should elevate Hurts' stock in Week 12.
</div>

### 🟢 DK Metcalf (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Aaron Rodgers (left wrist) didn't come back out for the second half, so Mason Rudolph took over under center. Each quarterback threw a touchdown pass to running back Kenneth Gainwell and Pittsburgh's defense scored two touchdowns, but no Steelers wide receiver besides Metcalf had more than two targets. Metcalf is the top option in Pittsburgh's passing game heading into a Week 12 trip to Chicago, but it remains to be seen which quarterback will be throwing him the ball.
</div>

### 🟢 Christian McCaffrey (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> McCaffrey took full advantage of a soft defensive matchup en route to the fifth three-score game of his decorated career. After being held out of the end zone on the ground through the first five weeks of the season, CMC has run wild with six rushing touchdowns over San Francisco's last six contests. The improved rushing totals haven't come at the expense of the versatile superstar's production through the air, as he upped his stellar receiving line to 74-732-5 through 11 starts. A red-hot McCaffrey will set his sights on his former club in a primetime tilt against the Panthers on Monday Night Football in Week 12.
</div>

### 🟢 Rachaad White (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> White played a clear second fiddle on the ground to backfield mate Sean Tucker, who logged a season-high 19 carries and turned them into 106 yards and two rushing touchdowns. However, White had his share of productive gains against the Bills' suspect run defense, finishing with his second-highest rushing yardage total of the season. White also has double-digit carries in six straight games, but he could see his workload take a hit if Bucky Irving (foot/shoulder) is able to make his long-awaited return from injury on the road against the Rams in Week 12.
</div>

### 🟡 Elic Ayomanor (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Ayomanor dealt with a hamstring issue late in the contest, per Jim Wyatt of the Titans' official site, with his status going forward of note, considering the Titans lost both Calvin Ridley (leg) and Chimere Dike (concussion/chest) to injuries within Sunday's game. Ayomanor hasn't recorded more than four receptions or 56 yards in any game this season, but assuming he's available, he'll be in line for an expanded role moving forward due to Ridley already being ruled out for the season and Dike potentially sidelined for a Week 12 home matchup against the Seahawks next Sunday.
