## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟡 Marvin Harrison Jr. (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 Jacoby Brissett (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Working without No. 1 WR Marvin Harrison (concussion) on Sunday, Brissett set an NFL record for a single game with his 47 completions, helping fuel a pair of 100-yard receiving efforts from WR Michael Wilson (15-185-0 on 18 targets) and TE Trey McBride (10-115-1 on 11 targets). The pass-heavy approach from the Cardinals likely was spurred by being down double-digit points as soon as the 13:39 mark of the second quarter, and the closest margin after that point was nine points before the 49ers tacked on a pair of field goals in the last 1:01 of the first half. In five starts in place of Kyler Murray (foot, IR), Brissett has averaged 314 yards per game to go with a 10:3 TD:INT on 67 percent passing. Brissett's next chance to continue leading Arizona's offense is next Sunday versus the Jaguars.
</div>

### 🟡 Dalton Kincaid (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Kincaid is looking unlikely to play Thursday night against the Texans. With Kincaid out last Sunday against the Bucs, Dawson Knox played 77 percent of the offensive snaps and recorded one catch for 23 yards on three targets, while Jackson Hawes played 34 percent of the snaps and didn't draw a target. Neither would be an exciting fantasy play against Houston.
</div>

### 🟢 James Cook III (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Cook unsurprisingly found running room at a premium against a stingy Buccaneers front, but he was able to salvage his fantasy day with his best work of the season as a receiver. The fourth-year pro contributed a 25-yard touchdown reception on his three catches, and he finished with a season-high receiving yardage total. The going doesn't get any easier for Cook in Week 12, however, as the Bills face a tough Texans defense on the road in a Thursday night matchup.
</div>

### 🟢 Jared Goff (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Goff looked uncomfortable throughout the game, and his 37.8 percent completion rate was the worst of his career in a single contest, per Nolan Bianchi of The Detroit News. Most of his yardage came after the catch from Jahmyr Gibbs and Jameson Williams, the latter of whom accounted for Goff's only touchdown on a 40-yard catch and run. It was an abysmal performance from Goff, but he's still thrown for multiple touchdowns in five of his last seven games, and he should bounce back in Week 12 with a home matchup against the Giants.
</div>

### 🟢 Romeo Doubs (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Doubs tied with Christian Watson for the team lead in receptions -- the duo represented the only Packers pass catchers to log more than one catch -- and the former also set the pace in targets and receiving yards. Doubs' performance represented a welcome resurgence from his abysmal one-reception, five-yard tally against the Eagles in Week 10, and he's eclipsed 50 receiving yards in five of his last seven contests heading into a Week 12  divisional home showdown against the Vikings.
</div>

### 🟢 Tyler Warren (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The rookie tight end finished as the Colts' leader in receptions, receiving yards and targets in the overseas clash, and all three totals also served as new career highs for Warren. The Penn State product has been as good as expected over his first nine games, and he'll head into the Week 11 bye with a robust 50-617-3 receiving line on 67 targets after serving as one of Daniel Jones' primary security blankets during the latter's resurgent first half of the season.
</div>

### 🟢 Ashton Jeanty (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Las Vegas abandoned the run early in Monday's lopsided loss, resulting in Jeanty's worst rushing totals in 10 starts as a pro. The Raiders ran the ball just 12 times out of 59 plays on offense, and the imbalanced playcalling prevented the team's prized rookie from gaining any momentum. The six receptions served as the only silver lining for those participating in PPR formats, and they also represented a new single-game high for Jeanty. The route to a bounce-back performance in Week 12 will be steep, as Jeanty will have to find room to run behind a porous offensive line while facing Cleveland's dominant defensive front on Sunday.
</div>

### 🟡 Kayshon Boutte (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The wideout practiced in a limited capacity prior to being ruled out against the Jets in Week 11 after previously sitting out Week 10 against Tampa Bay. In three appearances prior to injuring his hamstring, Boutte had tallied a tremendous 10-223-4 receiving line on 12 targets, and he'll face an exceptional matchup against the Bengals in Week 12 if he's able to retake the field.
</div>

### 🟡 Jaxson Dart (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Dart missed the Week 11 loss to the Packers and has been checked for a concussion four times already this season, but it sounds like there's a chance the rookie quarterback will be back under center for Week 12 in Detroit. In Dart's absence against Green Bay, Jameis Winston made the start and completed 19 of 29 pass attempts for 201 scoreless yards and one interception. If Dart is unable to play against the Lions, Winston likely would make another start.
</div>

### 🟢 AJ Barner (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Barner bounced back nicely from a zero-catch effort in Week 10 to post career-best marks in targets, receptions and yardage against the Rams. The sophomore tight end recorded two more carries on Seattle's variation of Philadelphia's "tush push," but only one attempt proved to be successful in the divisional loss. Barner's big game pushed him up to 31 receptions for 306 yards through 10 starts, surpassing his rookie year totals of 30 and 245, respectively.
</div>

### 🟢 Tez Johnson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Despite Chris Godwin (fibula) logging another absence and Johnson logging the second-most snaps (58) among the Bucs' wide receivers, the latter couldn't extend what had been a productive five-game run. The rookie's 18-247-4 line on 27 targets in that span appeared to be a distant memory against a stingy Bills secondary, and if Godwin, who practiced on a limited basis during Week 11 prep, manages to suit up for a Week 12 Sunday night road showdown with the Rams, Johnson could be relegated to a No. 4 receiver role in that contest.
</div>

### 🟡 Chimere Dike (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Dike was evaluated for a concussion and ruled out at halftime, but it turns out he is dealing with a different issue, this one with his chest. The rookie wideout came into Week 11 with 21 catches (on 33 targets) for 194 yards and one touchdown over nine games. Veteran wideout Calvin Ridley, who was the team's second-leading receiver coming into Sunday, also sustained a season-ending broken fibula, according to Turron Davenport of ESPN.com. Dike will have a week to recover before the Week 12 game versus Seattle next Sunday; otherwise, Van Jefferson and Mason Kinsey will have to step up behind Elic Ayomanor (hamstring).
</div>

### 🟢 Chris Rodriguez Jr. (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The third-year RB took the lead in the Washington backfield, getting 16 touches to Jacory Croskey-Merritt's 10 and out-gaining the rookie 85 scrimmage yards to 33. The workload and yardage total were also season highs for Rodriguez, and he's making a solid case to break out of the Commanders' committee and take over the clear No. 1 job on the other side of the team's Week 12 bye. Rodriguez has already set new career highs with 60 carries for 279 rushing yards and three TDs through nine games.
