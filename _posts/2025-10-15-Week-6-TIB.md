## Player Report

#### Kyler Murray (QB)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** questionable
#### Darnell Mooney (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** questionable
#### Kyle Pitts Sr. (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Pitts followed up his best performance of the season against the Commanders (5-70-1) with his lowest fantasy score to date on Monday Night Football. Michael Penix was keyed in on Drake London (10-158-1) and Bijan Robinson (6-68-0) in the passing game, leaving scraps for Pitts and the rest of Atlanta's auxiliary options. Pitts still carries a modest 23-223-1 receiving line into a Week 7 road tilt against the 49ers on Sunday.
#### Mark Andrews (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The positive for Andrews was that he remained involved in the Baltimore offense, finishing tied for second on the team in targets. He was unable to convert that into much production while catching passes from the combination of Cooper Rush and Tyler Huntley, with his longest gain going for only nine yards. The outlook for all Ravens pass catchers should improve with the anticipated return of Lamar Jackson (hamstring) in Week 8 following the team's bye, though Andrews could lose out on opportunity to more explosive options such as Rashod Bateman and Isaiah Likely.
#### Keon Coleman (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Coleman tied for the team lead in receptions and targets, but as his final line indicates, those opportunities were essentially for naught. The second-year wideout has endured an underwhelming season that's included a Week 5 benching for that game's opening series, and Coleman notably couldn't make an impact Monday despite the Bills being without Dalton Kincaid (oblique) and Curtis Samuel (neck/ribs) to begin the game and then losing Joshua Palmer (ankle) during the contest. Coleman and quarterback Josh Allen will have a Week 7 bye to work on their chemistry before returning to action Oct. 26 on the road against the Panthers.
#### Tetairoa McMillan (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** As his final line indicates, the rookie first-round pick made excellent use of his trio of catches, turning two of them into 19- and two-yard touchdown grabs for the first pair of end-zone trips of his career. Otherwise, McMillan's reception, yardage and target totals all tied or served as new season lows, making it a mixed bag of a day to an extent from a fantasy perspective. Nevertheless, McMillan's role as Carolina's No. 1 receiver is as iron clad as it gets, but he's likely to draw plenty of Sauce Gardner's attention in a Week 7 visit to the Jets next Sunday afternoon.
#### Javonte Williams (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** The Cowboys were forced into a relatively pass-heavy game script as they kept pace with the Panthers. That limited Williams to a season-low 13 carries, but the primary issue was his lack of efficiency. Williams' longest rush went for only six yards, and his longest reception was good for only nine yards. The positive takeaway is that Williams earned 18 touches and the next closest Dallas back (Jaydon Blue) had only three. Williams should have a strong chance to bounce back in Week 7 against Washington.
#### Marvin Mims Jr. (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Mims played 21 of the Broncos' 60 offensive snaps Sunday, behind fellow wide receivers Courtland Sutton (48), Pat Bryant (35) and Troy Franklin (35). The third-year wideout's 35 percent snap share was his lowest mark of the season. Mims has flashed his play-making ability at times this season, but his inconsistent usage in Denver's offense makes him extremely difficult to trust for fantasy purposes. The 23-year-old will have his next chance to take a step forward in a Week 7 matchup against the Giants, yet he'll continue to face stiff competition for targets in a crowded receiving corps.
#### Josh Jacobs (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** The Packers had an efficient offensive day, both on the ground and through the air. Jacobs unsurprisingly led the way as a rusher, ripping off long runs of 16 and 14 yards -- the latter of which went for a touchdown to kick off the fourth quarter. He also turned in his third straight game with at least four catches. Despite not reaching 100 rushing yards in any game, Jacobs has found the end zone six times in five contests and remains one of the most reliable fantasy contributors at running back.
#### Quentin Johnston (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** questionable
#### Carson Wentz (QB)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Wentz contended with soreness in his non-throwing shoulder during the Vikings' Oct. 6 win over the Browns in London, but he was able to finish out the contest. He appears to have made some progress in his recovery over the Vikings' Week 7 bye, though it won't be clear until Wednesday whether he's participating in practice as a full participant. J.J. McCarthy (ankle) also returned to practice Monday for the first time since Sept. 14, so even if his shoulder proves to be a non-issue, Wentz may move to the bench for Sunday's game against the Eagles after starting in each of the previous three games. The Vikings will likely gauge the health of McCarthy and Wentz throughout the week of practice before announcing a starter for Sunday.
#### Justin Jefferson (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Jefferson paced the Vikings in receptions, receiving yards and targets on the day, turning in his second consecutive 100-yard effort in the process. His final reception of the contest was especially critical, as he came down with a 21-yard grab to take the ball to the Browns' 27 yard-line with under two minutes remaining on Minnesota's game-winning drive. Jefferson has displayed excellent chemistry with fill-in signal-caller Carson Wentz over the last pair of contests, but J.J. McCarthy (ankle) may be set to return to action when the Vikings come out of a Week 6 bye to host the Eagles on Sunday, Oct. 19.
#### Theo Johnson (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Johnson had flashed with a season-high six receptions and a pair of touchdowns in the Week 5 loss to the Saints on Sunday, but he was a lot quieter four days later despite the Giants' successful night on offense. Nevertheless, he finished with at least four targets for the third straight game, and he appears to have a solid rapport with rookie signal-caller Jaxson Dart heading into a challenging Week 7 road matchup against the Broncos on Sunday, Oct. 19.
#### Justin Fields (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Coach Aaron Glenn admitted Monday that Fields, who completed just nine of 17 pass attempts for 45 yards while absorbing nine sacks, "took a step back" in Sunday's 13-11 loss to the Broncos in London, but the current plan is to stick with the 26-year-old under center. Behind Fields on the depth chart are 36-year-old Tyrod Taylor, who is a known commodity as a reliable veteran backup at this stage of his career, and undrafted rookie Brady Cook on the practice squad. Taylor isn't a long-term answer, and Cook likely isn't ready for regular-season NFL action. Things could change if Fields doesn't rebound and show signs of improvement.
#### Chris Godwin Jr. (WR)
**Injury Status:** Doubtful <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** doubtful
