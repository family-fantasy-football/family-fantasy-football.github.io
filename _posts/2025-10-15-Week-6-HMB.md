## Player Report

#### Zay Flowers (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Flowers was targeted heavily by the combination of Cooper Rush and Tyler Huntley, with no other Baltimore pass catcher earning more than six targets. He had long gains of 18 and 10 yards, though the latter was undone when he fumbled on the same play. Flowers has been mediocre from a fantasy perspective in the absence of Lamar Jackson (hamstring) despite consistent volume in the offense. However, he should be in line for more explosive performances with Jackson expected back in Week 8 following Baltimore's bye.
#### Derrick Henry (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** The Ravens' offensive game plan was to feed Henry as much as possible, limiting the need for Cooper Rush to take to the air. That was effective in the first half, as Henry delivered 18 carries for 90 yards while Baltimore also controlled time of possession. Game script ultimately got away from the team, but this was a needed performance from Henry, both in terms of volume and efficiency. He recorded three rushes of more than 10 yards to top 50 yards for the first time since Week 1. Henry's 25 touches were also his most of the campaign, and he should benefit from the expected return of Lamar Jackson (hamstring) in Week 8, following the team's bye.
#### Josh Allen (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Allen's final line tells the tale of a difficult night against a well-rested and aggressive Falcons defense fueled by its home crowd. Despite his signature mobility, Allen was sacked four times, and he also tossed multiple interceptions for the first time this season, including a game-sealing pick at Atlanta's 7-yard line with 51 seconds remaining. The reigning NFL MVP's yardage total also was his second lowest of the season, and the fact he went into the contest without Dalton Kincaid (oblique) and Curtis Samuel (neck/ribs) before also losing Joshua Palmer to an ankle injury in the first half certainly didn't help Allen's cause. Buffalo now gets a much-needed bye following back-to-back losses before returning to action against the Panthers in Carolina on Sunday, Oct. 26.
#### Sam LaPorta (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** LaPorta was one of the more effective pass catchers in the Detroit offense, delivering two key receptions. The first was a 26-yard catch and run to end the first quarter, which ultimately helped set up a touchdown. LaPorta caught a touchdown of his own early in the fourth quarter on an impressive one-handed, toe-tapping grab in the back of the end zone from four yards away. LaPorta has put together consecutive strong showings, combining to record 10 receptions for 147 yards and two touchdowns in his last two contests.
#### Amon-Ra St. Brown (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** St. Brown maintained his role as Jared Goff's favorite target, but it was otherwise a tough showing for him. His longest catch of the day went for only 12 yards, and he also uncharacteristically dropped a pass on a key fourth-down attempt midway through the second quarter, which shifted the momentum of the game. This marked the first time since Week 1 that St. Brown has failed to reach 70 receiving yards, and he should bounce back in Week 7 in a matchup of high-powered offenses against Tampa Bay.
#### Tucker Kraft (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Kraft had a quiet day, with Romeo Doubs and Matthew Golden dominating looks among the Green Bay pass catchers. He salvaged the low-volume performance with a pair of big plays, the most important of which was a 19-yard touchdown midway through the fourth quarter. Kraft now has three touchdowns on the season while also recording at least three catches in three of his five games.
#### Jordan Love (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** The Packers were happy to rely upon Josh Jacobs as the primary driver of their offense, but Love turned in a strong performance when called upon. He completed six passes of at least 20 yards and tacked on a touchdown pass of 19 yards. Love continues to operate Green Bay's offense effectively, though he's now taken to the air fewer than 30 times in three of five games this season. That makes him reliant upon big plays and touchdowns to deliver for fantasy purposes.
#### JuJu Smith-Schuster (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Smith-Schuster made the most of his three grabs, tallying 30, 17 and 10 yards on each of them to reach 57 for the day, but that doesn't generate enough fantasy value to warrant using him in the majority of formats. On top of that, Rashee Rice returns this week to reclaim his spot in the slot. With Hollywood Brown claiming a starting role and Tyquan Thornton and second-year wideout Xavier Worthy all vying for playing time, Smith-Schuster is at risk of getting squeezed out of some snaps moving forward.
#### Kareem Hunt (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Hunt has seen his playing time drop off in the past couple of weeks, recording sub-40 percent snap shares after crossing that threshold, including double-digit carries, against both the Giants in Week 3 and Ravens in Week 4. He remains a handcuff option in leagues with a little bit of fantasy upside if he reaches paydirt. Still, he won't find consistent value as long as Isiah Pacheco is healthy and available.
#### Tre Tucker (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Tucker finished as the Raiders' leading receiver on a low-volume day from the passing offense. The 24-year-old finished with a receiving line somewhere in between the highs and lows we had seen over his previous five appearances. The overall package has been a net positive from the speedy wideout after producing a 24-356-4 line through six starts. Tucker provides enough upside to warrant a spot in most fantasy lineups ahead of next Sunday's tilt against Kansas City.
#### Blake Corum (RB)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Corum briefly exited Sunday's win in the second quarter due to an ankle injury and was initially labeled as questionable, but he managed to return to action after halftime and finish the day with five carries for 23 yards. Only one of those carries came after his return, however. The second-year pro doesn't have clean bill of health yet, but the fact that he was able to return versus the Ravens lends credence to the notion that he'll be able to play in Week 7 against the Jaguars and handle his usual No. 2 role behind Kyren Williams. Rookie fourth-rounder Jarquez Hunter would benefit from increased opportunities if Corum were to miss any time.
#### Kenneth Gainwell (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Jaylen Warren served as Pittsburgh's lead back in a traditional sense, out-carrying Gainwell 11-6. However, Gainwell was more involved as a pass catcher, leading to a near-even split in total touches. Gainwell didn't make much of a case to further overtake Warren with an inefficient performance, but he appears to have a clear role in the Pittsburgh backfield for the time being.
#### Sterling Shepard (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Shepard was elevated to second on the receiver depth chart after Mike Evans (hamstring) and Chris Godwin (fibula) were ruled out for Sunday's tilt. Things could have opened up more for the veteran after Emeka Egbuka (hamstring) left the contest early, but it was fellow wideouts Kameron Johnson and Tez Johnson who cashed in a pair of Baker Mayfield passing touchdowns Sunday. While things didn't pan out for Shepard in Week 6 (given his elevated opportunities), Egbuka's potential absence moving forward means that Shepard is worth holding for next Monday's tilt against the Lions.
#### Cam Ward (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Ward had Tennessee's offense in shambles out of the gates Sunday, leading six first-half drives that resulted in four punts and two turnovers (both charged to Ward). The rookie signal-caller finally woke up in the fourth quarter, but a third and final turnover thwarted any plans for a comeback. Ward managed to end a scoreless drought lasting two weeks, but he still has more interceptions thrown (four) than touchdowns (three) through six starts. The Titans are looking like a work in progress in Ward's first season as a pro, so fantasy managers should look for safer options in Week 7.
#### Jacory Croskey-Merritt (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** The rookie seventh-round pick was coming off a career-best performance Week 5 against the Chargers, but he surprisingly found tough sledding on the ground against a Bears defense that has struggled to contain the run. Croskey-Merritt's late-first-quarter fumble also was costly, as he lost the ball at his own 33-yard line and saw the Bears score a touchdown on a Caleb Williams one-yard run five plays later. Despite the miscue, Croskey-Merritt remained the clear lead option in the ground attack, as No. 2 back Jeremy McNichols recorded just two carries. Croskey-Merritt's outlook for Week 7 remains bright, as a road matchup with the porous Cowboys defense is on tap Sunday.
