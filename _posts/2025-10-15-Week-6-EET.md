## Player Report

#### Drake London (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** It was the Bijan Robinson and Drake London Show on Monday Night Football after the two budding superstars accounted for 396 of Atlanta's 443 yards of offense. The 23-year-old London didn't cool off over his team's Week 5 bye, bookending the break with a pair of 100-plus yard games with a touchdown scored in each. He actually finished the contest as the only wide receiver to record a catch for Atlanta, highlighting his status as QB Michael Penix's unquestioned No. 1 target. A red-hot London will set his sights on a battered 49ers defense Week 7.
#### Justice Hill (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The Ravens ran a run-heavy offense as long as possible, giving Hill a chance to mix in on possessions to relieve Derrick Henry. Hill saw a season-high six carries as a result, but he made a more significant impact as a pass catcher. His usage could change with the anticipated return of Lamar Jackson (hamstring) after the team's bye, but Hill has at least three catches in four of six games on the campaign.
#### Joshua Palmer (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** questionable
#### Courtland Sutton (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Sutton traveled overseas to London for Sunday's international tilt, only to be greeted impolitely by Jets' CB Sauce Gardner once the game kicked off. The shutdown corner won his individual matchup against Sutton, holding Denver's No. 1 wideout to just one reception in the narrow victory. This was Sutton's second one-catch performance through six starts this season, which would be concerning if he hadn't posted WR1 numbers in his four other appearances. Sunday's dud can be written off as a bad matchup coupled with an unfavorable game script. Look for Sutton to get back to his productive ways against the Giants next Sunday.
#### Trevor Lawrence (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Lawrence's final passing line with more than adequate, but he also took seven sacks and finished with an ugly 46.6 QBR for the afternoon. The 2021 first overall pick did continue to cultivate his connection with No. 1 receiver Brian Thomas, who he hit on eight occasions for 90 yards, including a 21-yard touchdown late in the first quarter. Lawrence hit Tim Patrick from 26 yards out early in the fourth quarter for his other TD toss, the quarterback's first multi-touchdown-pass tally since Week 2. Despite the solid numbers, the modest point total did Jacksonville in Sunday, a matter he'll look to rectify in a London matchup against the high-powered Rams in Week 7.
#### Hollywood Brown (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Brown delivered a standout performance under the bright lights of Sunday Night Football when he lifted his team with two trips to the end zone in the second half. The 28-year-old has done an admirable job starting for a thin Chiefs' receiving corps, producing a 30-302-3 line through six weeks of action. The impending doom Brown's managers are currently feeling is the looming return of Kansas City's top WR Rashee Rice. The suspended wideout will return for next Sunday's tilt against the Raiders, potentially eating into his replacement's production in the process. Brown should remain rostered until the dust settles from Rice's return, but expectations should be kept in check for Week 7.
#### Jakobi Meyers (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Meyers' recent struggles continued, as he failed to eclipse 40 receiving yards for the third week running. At least the Raiders were able to pick up a win after losing their previous two contests during the wideout's current slump. Las Vegas is still without the services of star TE Brock Bowers (knee), so Meyers needs to step up his play for both his team and frustrated fantasy managers. Perhaps Meyers can turn his disappointing campaign around if he can find the end zone for the first time in 2025 against the Chiefs next Sunday.
#### Rashid Shaheed (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** The speedy wideout  has caught exactly four passes in five straight games, but Sunday's yardage total was his lowest of the season. Shaheed remains dependent on deep throws for significant fantasy value, but with Spencer Rattler getting more confident and comfortable in coach Kellen Moore's offense, connections like last week's 87-yard TD could become more frequent. Shaheed may have a better chance of making an impact in Week 7 against the Bears.
#### Saquon Barkley (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Barkley was set up well on paper for a matchup against the Giants' porous run defense, but game script would eventually cap his opportunities and lead to his second-lowest carry total of the campaign. He was efficient with his opportunities, averaging an encouraging 4.8 yards per carry after posting 5.0 yards per tote in the Week 5 loss to the Broncos. Barkley has still to crack the 90-yard mark on the ground through six games, however, and he's still averaging just 3.4 yards per carry on the season thanks to a slow start to the season. Barkley will have a tough Week 7 challenge on his hands as well, considering the talented Vikings defense awaits in a Week 7 road matchup on Sunday, Oct. 19.
#### Brock Purdy (QB)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** questionable
#### George Kittle (TE)
**Injury Status:** Injured Reserve <br>
**Lineup Slot:** IR <br>
**Details:** San Francisco has yet to designate Kittle to return from injured reserve, which will need to happen for the tight end to mix into drills. The team resumes practicing Wednesday in advance of next Sunday's game against the Falcons, meaning the aforementioned transaction may transpire before then. In any case, Kittle appears poised to put the finishing touches on his recovery from the hamstring injury that has sidelined him since Week 1.
#### Tony Pollard (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Pollard finished with his worst fantasy score of the season in a seemingly promising matchup against the Raiders defense. The veteran starter still led Tennessee's backfield with 10 carries, finishing five ahead of backup Tyjae Spears. Pollard's reduced touches were rather the result of a poor game script as opposed to a changing of the guard in Tennessee's backfield. Fantasy managers should continue treating Pollard as a potential flex option against the Patriots next Sunday.
#### Zach Ertz (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Following a Week 5 blanking at the hands of the Chargers, Ertz enjoyed a noteworthy resurgence in Monday's narrow loss. The veteran tight end led the Commanders in receptions and targets while checking in behind only Chris Moore in receiving yards. Ertz also posted his first touchdown since Week 2 on a six-yard scoring grab early in the fourth quarter, rounding out an encouraging night that also saw him tie a season high in receptions. He should have a good chance at carrying over his momentum into Week 7, as he'll face the Cowboys' vulnerable defense on the road.
