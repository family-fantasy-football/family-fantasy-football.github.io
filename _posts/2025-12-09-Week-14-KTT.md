## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Bam Knight (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Knight failed to take advantage of lead-back duties with both Trey Benson (knee) and Emari Demercado (ankle) still missing Sunday. The 24-year-old Knight struggled to generate much running room early on, then fell victim to the blowout game script in the second half. The journeyman backup failed to mask his poor production with a trip to the end zone like we saw in Weeks 11 and 12. With the aforementioned teammates potentially nearing returns, Knight's brief run of fantasy utility could come to a close in short order, assuming it hasn't run dry already.
</div>

### 🟢 Tyler Allgeier (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Falcons offense couldn't get into the end zone, but the backfield had a solid performance as Bijan Robinson collected 94 scrimmage yards on 22 touches and Allgeier added 67 yards on 13 touches. It's the first time Allgeier has reached 60 yards from scrimmage since Week 2, and he'll remain a TD-dependent fantasy option in Week 15 against the Buccaneers.
</div>

### 🟡 David Njoku (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Njoku hurt his knee while making a diving catch for a touchdown on the second play of the second quarter. After heading directly to the locker room following the incident, Njoku returned to the field but only to enter the medical tent. He's battled a sore knee the last three weeks, and it looks like that streak will extend at least one more week. Harold Fannin, who also caught a touchdown Sunday, will be the main beneficiary if Njoku is forced to miss any games.
</div>

### 🟢 Evan Engram (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> After breaking out for season-high marks with six catches and 79 receiving yards last Sunday versus Washington, Engram finished with his second-lowest receiving yardage tally in Week 14. The veteran tight end hasn't really been able to get going in his first year with the Broncos, managing a modest 40 catches for 347 yards and just one touchdown through 12 games. He'll be a low-end fantasy option in Week 15 against a Packers defense that ranks in the top half of the league in most categories versus tight ends.
</div>

### 🟢 Brian Thomas Jr. (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jakobi Meyers led the Jaguars in targets, but Thomas delivered several big plays to pace Jacksonville in yardage. He made a particularly impressive one-handed catch down the right sideline late in the first quarter for a 39-yard gain -- his longest of the day. Thomas' other two catches went for 30 and 18 yards, giving him his highest yardage total since Week 6. While he's had a disappointing season, Thomas has a strong chance to remain on track heading into a favorable Week 15 matchup against the Jets.
</div>

### 🟢 Rashee Rice (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Rice struggled with drops on Sunday Night Football, finishing with his worst catch rate (50 percent) through seven starts this season. Kansas City's top wideout still led the club in targets, but the offense simply ran into the buzzsaw that is the Texans' defense in 2025. Rice is still putting together a dominant fantasy campaign in a suspension-shortened season, sporting a 46-520-5 receiving line across seven games. Fantasy managers should continue starting Rice with confidence in next Sunday's matchup against the Chargers.
</div>

### 🟢 Isiah Pacheco (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> After missing the prior three games due to a knee injury, Pacheco was back in action but found himself firmly behind Kareem Hunt in the backfield pecking order, as the veteran turned 15 touches into 80 yards from scrimmage. Hunt's recent success appears to have solidified his spot at the top of the depth chart, and Pacheco -- who has yet to reach 60 rushing yards in any game this season -- will likely struggle to make an impact on limited volume Week 14 against the Texans.
</div>

### 🟢 Ladd McConkey (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The entire Los Angeles passing attack struggled to do much of anything as Justin Herbert was pressured on close to 60 percent of his dropbacks. It's at least encouraging the second-year standout led the team in targets, but similar issues could be present in Arrowhead the following week as Los Angeles takes on a Kansas City team trying to keep its playoff hopes alive.
</div>

### 🟡 De'Von Achane (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Achane underwent an MRI after sustaining a rib injury in Sunday's victory over the Jets. Although it was determined the running back is not dealing with a serious setback, head coach Mike McDaniel revealed that Achane "needs treatment," which could affect his practice participation this week. Miami will face Pittsburgh on Monday night in Week 15, so while that will afford Achane more rest, it will also likely delay the next official update on the running back's status until Thursday.
</div>

### 🟢 Wan'Dale Robinson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Robinson finished in a tie with TE Theo Johnson for the team lead in targets in QB Jaxson Dart's (concussion) return to action Monday. The 24-year-old Robinson was dealing with an injury of his own during the practice week, but he avoided a designation, and the minor ankle issue didn't limit New York's No. 1 receiver in the loss. Robinson recorded at least seven receptions for the fourth time this season (after generating a career-high 93 receptions in 2024) as he continues to put in work for managers in PPR leagues. He'll look to add to a current high-water mark of 828 receiving yards when the Giants return from their Week 14 bye to face the Commanders on Sunday, Dec. 14.
</div>

### 🟡 Tyrod Taylor (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Fields was inactive for Sunday's 34-10 loss to the Dolphins, and Taylor lasted only two series in the contest because of a groin injury before being replaced by rookie Brady Cook. In terms of the Jets' QB plans for a Week 15 game against the Jaguars, Glenn indicated Monday that the team will "have to see what guys are healthy enough to go out there and give us a chance to win." The team's signal-caller situation likely won't gain any clarity until at least Wednesday, when the Jets' next practice/injury report is posted.
</div>

### 🟢 Adonai Mitchell (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Mitchell cooled off after his breakout performance against the Falcons in the previous game, though he wasn't helped by subpar quarterback play from third-stringer Brady Cook, who replaced Tyrod Taylor (groin) in the first half. Mitchell caught eight of 12 targets for 102 yards and a touchdown against Atlanta but has caught only four of 19 targets for 76 yards across three other appearances for the Jets. His target volume has been encouraging, but the inconsistent wide receiver's floor will remain low in Week 15 against the Jaguars, especially if the Jets start Cook or Justin Fields (knee) under center.
</div>

### 🟢 Mike Evans (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Injured Reserve<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The wideout hasn't played since suffering a broken collarbone Oct. 20, but coach Todd Bowles noted Monday that both Evans and Jalen McMillan (neck) are in play to potentially return to action Thursday night against the Falcons, Rick Stroud of the Tampa Bay Times reports. Look for added context regarding the duo's Week 15 status to arrive in conjunction with Tuesday's practice/injury report.
</div>

### 🟢 Baker Mayfield (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Mayfield's final line underscores the type of afternoon it was for the normally efficient veteran signal-caller, who surprisingly struggled to a 44.9 QBR in a game for which the Buccaneers were heavily favored. Mayfield connected with Bucky Irving for a 24-yard touchdown pass just before the midway point of the first quarter, but his one interception on a deep pass to Kameron Johnson early in the third quarter led to a Saints touchdown. Mayfield could get Mike Evans (IR, collarbone) back for a Week 15 home matchup against the Falcons on Thursday night to help the quarterback bounce back from his lowest passing yardage total in a non-injury-shortened game this season.
</div>

### 🟡 Jayden Daniels (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Per Ben Standig of Big 100 Washington D.C., Quinn previously relayed that Daniels (left elbow) could have returned to Sunday's 31-0 loss to Vikings after exiting the contest, but it was a coach's decision to keep the signal-caller on the sideline. That said, Quinn indicated Monday that Daniels will be monitored ahead of Sunday's game against the Giants, with the QB's Week 15 status yet to be determined.
