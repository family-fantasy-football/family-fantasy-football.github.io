## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Zay Flowers (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Flowers not only finished with his lowest yardage total of the season, but his fumble at the Ravens' 43-yard line with just over four minutes remaining led to a Bengals field goal and essentially snuffed out any hopes of a comeback for Baltimore. His target count was actually his highest since Week 8, but a combination of a surprisingly effective Bengals defense and Lamar Jackson's struggles with accuracy helped lead to a highly inefficient line for Flowers. He'll aim to bounce back against an inconsistent Steelers secondary in a Week 14 home matchup on Sunday, Dec. 7.
</div>

### 🟢 Derrick Henry (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Henry appeared well on his way to a stellar night when he rumbled for a 28-yard touchdown with 6:33 remaining in the first quarter, a run that turned out to be his longest of the night. However, game script would progressively turn against the Ravens' ground attack in the second half as the Bengals expanded their lead, leading to Henry's opportunities being significantly capped. The talented back's best play of the night actually came on his one catch, on which he carved out his longest gain of the season through the air. Henry has hit or eclipsed the 60-yard mark on the ground in eight consecutive games heading into a Week 14 home divisional clash against the Steelers on Sunday, Dec. 7.
</div>

### 🟢 Josh Allen (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Allen was a late addition to the Bills' injury report despite being a full participant in every practice leading up to Sunday's bout with Pittsburgh. The star quarterback showed no limitations from the minor elbow injury, using both his arm and legs to hit pay dirt and get Buffalo back in the win column. Sunday marked the 49th time that the 29-year-old has both thrown and ran for a touchdown in the same game. Allen's fantasy managers are hoping that dual-threat quarterback can notch No. 50 in a soft matchup against the Bengals next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Noah Fant (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Fant at least played more snaps, 33 compared to 18 the week before, but wasn't a big part of the passing game. With Mike Gesicki healthy again, Fant's already modest level of production is incredibly unstable.
</div>

### 🟡 Amon-Ra St. Brown (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> As expected, St. Brown was idle to begin the practice week ahead of Thursday night's date with the Cowboys. St. Brown was injured very early in the first quarter of last Thursday's loss to the Packers and was diagnosed with a low-ankle sprain. If St. Brown is unable to play, Tom Kennedy would likely be the next man up as the slot receiver, but Jameson Williams should again be the biggest beneficiary from a target volume perspective.
</div>

### 🟢 Alec Pierce (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Colts distributed targets evenly among their pass catchers, but Pierce had the benefit of consistently working as a deep threat. All four of his receptions went for at least 18 yards, including a 19-yard touchdown catch midway through the second quarter -- his second of the season. Pierce has at least 70 receiving yards in four of his last six games and has emerged as one of Daniel Jones' most reliable pass catchers.
</div>

### 🟢 Kareem Hunt (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Even with Isiah Pacheco back in the lineup, Hunt handled the bulk of the work in the Kansas City backfield, getting 15 touches to Pacheco's five and out-gaining him 80 yards from scrimmage to 33. Hunt did see his four-game TD streak come to an end, but the 80 combined yards were his second-highest total of the season after last week's 130. The veteran appears to have a firm hold of the No. 1 RB job heading into a tough Week 14 matchup against the Texans.
</div>

### 🟢 Tre Tucker (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> No Raiders wide receiver saw more than three targets, while Brock Bowers and Ashton Jeanty combined for 10 catches, 93 yards and two touchdowns on 12 targets. Tucker should continue to see significant playing time in the Raiders' underwhelming receiving corps, but production won't be easy to come by in Week 14 against a Broncos defense that has been among the best in the league at limiting wide receivers. If you take away Tucker's 145-yard, three-touchdown outburst against the Commanders in Week 3, he's averaging only 36.8 receiving yards in 11 other games this season.
</div>

### 🟢 Keenan Allen (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Allen was his usual reliable self on third down, specifically in the first half, but the veteran was hardly needed as the Raiders offense continually stalled out. Justin Herbert fractured his left hand during the first half, an injury that will require surgery Monday. Head coach Jim Harbaugh and Herbert are hopeful the quarterback will be available in a critical Week 14 bout against the Eagles, but Allen's fantasy value arguably takes the biggest hit if the starting quarterback misses time. The 33-year-old has failed to see more than six targets in a game dating back to Week 8.
</div>

### 🟢 Jordan Mason (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Mason took over lead back duties after starter Aaron Jones (shoulder) exited the contest early in the second half. The 26-year-old Mason finished as Minnesota's leading rusher after gashing Seattle's defense on limited opportunities. It is currently unclear if Jones will be forced to miss any time with the shoulder injury, but fantasy managers should monitor the situation after Mason thrived in the starter's absence earlier in the schedule. Minnesota's backup averaged 15.0 carries for 70.5 yards with four touchdowns scored in four spot-starts spanning Weeks 3 through 7. If Jones were to miss next Sunday's matchup against Washington, then Mason would instantly become a hot waiver target in Week 14.
</div>

### 🟢 Jonnu Smith (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Smith was on the field for 53 percent of Pittsburgh's offensive snaps Sunday, which ranked second among the team's tight ends, as Darnell Washington played 79 percent, while Pat Freiermuth played 40 percent. However, Smith's work in the passing game remained limited, and he's now secured five of nine targets for just 31 yards while rushing twice for seven yards across his last four appearances.
</div>

### 🟢 Darnell Washington (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Washington's modest performance was good enough to lead the Steelers in receiving yards, and he finished tied for second on the team in targets. Those thresholds were more indicative of the poor offensive showing for the Steelers, though Washington continues to gain more of a role as a receiver. He has at least four targets in three of his last five games -- logging at least 40 receiving yards in all three -- after hitting that mark only twice in his first eight contests.
</div>

### 🟢 Kenneth Gainwell (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Steelers played from behind for the entire second half, which should have benefited Gainwell in his role as the primary pass catcher out of the backfield. However, Pittsburgh managed only 21 offensive plays in the final two quarters, limiting the volume for all of the Steelers' skill-position players. Gainwell will continue to have a key role in the offense, but he's a boom-or-bust fantasy option given the unit's inability to consistently move the ball.
</div>

### 🟢 Cam Ward (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Ward entered Sunday's game having strung together a few positive performances, but his momentum came to an end in the Titans' Week 13 loss. His longest completion of the day went for only 16 yards, and only five of his completions went for double-digit yards. That left him without a touchdown while averaging just 3.7 yards per attempt -- his lowest mark of the campaign. The lone positive to take from the performance was that Ward didn't turn the ball over, but it was an ugly showing overall.
</div>

### 🟢 Jacory Croskey-Merritt (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The rookie running back has fallen behind Chris Rodriguez as the Commanders' preferred early-down running back, as Croskey-Merrit was out-snapped 37 to 13 by Rodriguez, who carried the ball 11 times for 41 yards and one touchdown. Both backs played fewer snaps than Jeremy McNichols, who produced six carries for 30 yards and two catches for zero yards on 44 offensive snaps. Stuck in a three-man committee, Croskey-Merrit can't be trusted in fantasy lineups.
