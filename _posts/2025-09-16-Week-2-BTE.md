## Player Report

#### Dalton Kincaid (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Kincaid led the Bills in targets and receiving yards as the passing attack took a back seat to the running game, which produced 224 yards and three touchdowns. The 2023 first-round pick has opened his third NFL campaign with a pair of four-catch performances and should remain involved in Thursday's Week 3 home game against the Dolphins.
#### DJ Moore (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Moore was a distant second in receiving yards and targets to Rome Odunze while finishing as the runner-up in receptions as well. As such, Moore took a clear back seat to Odunze in the air attack for at least this week, but the pecking order Sunday could indeed be a harbinger of what's to come as the season unfolds. Moore does have an 8-114-0 receiving line on 11 targets through two games heading into a Week 3 home matchup against the Cowboys next Sunday afternoon.
#### Roschon Johnson (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Johnson missed the regular-season opener due to a foot injury, which allowed rookie Kyle Monangai to operate as the backup behind D'Andre Swift. Johnson returned to practice during Week 2 prep and didn't have an injury designation heading into Sunday, so he should be full-go against Detroit. However, Swift handled 81 percent of the offensive snaps against Minnesota, so there may not be many opportunities to go around, especially if Monangai remains part of the mix.
#### Tee Higgins (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Higgins bounced back from a poor Week 1 performance, thanks primarily to a long 42-yard touchdown late in the third quarter. That pass was delivered by Jake Browning after Joe Burrow departed with a toe injury, and it was Higgins' only catch on five targets that he was able to haul in from Browning. If Burrow is set to miss additional time, Higgins could become a boom or bust fantasy option with Ja'Marr Chase continuing to dominate targets in the Cincinnati offense.
#### Jerome Ford (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Although debuting rookie Quinshon Judkins paced the ground attack with 10 rush attempts, Ford still logged two more carries than Dylan Sampson, who'd garnered more work than the veteran in Week 1. Ford also tied Harold Fannin for the team lead in receptions, and he filled the role of primary kickoff returner. Judkins' role figures to only grow moving forward, however, so how long Ford can remain truly relevant in the offense of a non-contending team while also navigating Sampson's presence remains to be seen.
#### Christian Kirk (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** questionable
#### C.J. Stroud (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Stroud didn't waste much time scoring the Texans' first touchdown of the season after failing to get his team into the end zone against the Rams in Week 1. The 24-year-old dialed up WR Nico Collins for a 27-yard score on Houston's opening drive, but that would end up being his only touchdown of the contest. Stroud failed to capitalize on a golden opportunity on the opponent's one-yard line early in the fourth quarter when he missed on two consecutive throws to turn the ball over on downs. With marginal yardage totals (197.5 passing yards per game) and just one touchdown to one interception through two starts, Stroud has played his way out of starting consideration in standard 1QB formats ahead of Sunday's tilt against Jacksonville.
#### Tre Tucker (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Tucker was one of four Raiders to average more than 20.0 yards per reception during quarterback Geno Smith's first game with Las Vegas on Sunday, and Tucker's performance was highlighted by a 26-yard touchdown catch on the opening possession. Working as the WR2 behind Jakobi Meyers with Amari Cooper electing to retire just before the start of the season, Tucker ultimately played 57 of a possible 63 offensive snaps. Additional targets could be up for grabs if tight end Brock Bowers (knee) were to miss any time.
#### J.J. McCarthy (QB)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Not long after coach Kevin O'Connell revealed Monday that McCarthy showed up to team facilities with a sore ankle that was deemed a sprain, Rapoport and Tom Pelissero of NFL Network are reporting that the injury may require some time on the sideline. McCarthy didn't fare well in Week 2, completing 11 of 21 passes for 158 yards, no touchdowns and two interceptions, turning five carries into 25 yards and losing one of his three fumbles. O'Connell also told Alec Lewis of The Athletic that Minnesota will get backup QB Carson Wentz ready for Sunday's game against the Bengals in the event McCarthy eventually is inactive.
#### DeMario Douglas (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** With the Patriots rolling with their share of multi-TE groupings in Week 2, in addition to the team mixing which WRs were on the field in three-WR alignments, Douglas saw a dip in playing time Sunday. Looking ahead, game plans and game flows in the coming weeks could lead to added opportunities for Douglas, but with a 3-6-1 receiving line (on eight targets) through two games, the Patriots' slot man profiles as a hit-or-miss option in PPR formats.
#### Juwan Johnson (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** For the second straight game Johnson saw impressive volume, finishing second on the Saints in targets behind Chris Olave's 10, and this time the tight end was able to turn one of them into a score as he caught an 18-yard strike from Spencer Rattler inside the final two minutes of the first half. Johnson saw only 66 targets in 17 regular-season games in 2024, but he's already gotten 21 in the first two games of the current campaign, leading to a 13-125-1 line. He could be headed for another big effort in Week 3 against a Seahawks defense that gave up two TDs to San Francisco TEs -- George Kittle (hamstring) and Jake Tonges -- in its opener before allowing a combined 7-58-0 line on eight targets to Steelers tight ends Jonnu Smith and Pat Freiermuth in Week 2.
#### Breece Hall (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Hall finished second on the team in both rushing yards and receiving yards, as Garrett Wilson (50) was the only Jet to reach double digits in the latter category. Justin Fields couldn't get anything going through the air prior to sustaining a concussion in the fourth quarter, and the lack of any passing threat made it hard for Hall to find any holes against a front-loaded Bills defense. Backup Braelon Allen handled just two carries, so at least Hall's locked in as the lead back heading into a Week 3 trip to Tampa Bay.
#### Dallas Goedert (TE)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** questionable
#### Zach Charbonnet (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Charbonnet was outplayed by Kenneth Walker, who turned 14 touches into 118 scrimmage yards and a touchdown. The 2022 and 2023 second-round draft picks have been deployed in a near-even split to begin the 2025 campaign. Seattle will likely continue to ride the hot hand in Week 3 against the Saints, though the workload could start to shift away from Charbonnet if Walker continues to outplay him.
#### Kenneth Walker III (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Walker was far more effective than Zach Charbonnet, who had just 10 rushing yards on 15 carries. The former put an exclamation point on the win by breaking free for a 19-yard touchdown run with 3:41 left in the fourth quarter. Walker had just 24 scrimmage yards and was outplayed by Charbonnet in Seattle's Week 1 loss to the 49ers, so they will likely continue to operate in a timeshare in Week 3 against the Saints, though the workload distribution could start to tilt in Walker's favor after his strong Week 2 performance.
#### Terry McLaurin (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** McLaurin finished third in receptions and second in receiving yards on the Commanders for the night, while also setting the pace in targets. As a whole, his collection of numbers certainly represented a nice boost from his 2-27-0 line on four targets Week 1 against the Giants, but through two games, the Commanders' passing game has been relatively conservative. McLaurin and Jayden Daniels will have some extra time to reestablish chemistry ahead of a Week 3 home matchup against the Raiders on Sunday, Sept. 21.
