## Player Report

#### Khalil Shakir (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Shakir matched his season high of nine targets, though he wasn't able to turn that into much production. Four of his six catches went for six or fewer yards, leading to his third performance with less than 50 receiving yards on the campaign. Shakir will continue to be a key part of the Buffalo offense, but he's reliant primarily on yards after the catch or touchdowns for big fantasy performances, with the majority of his opportunity coming in the short areas of the field.
#### Harold Fannin Jr. (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Fannin had a mixed performance in Dillon Gabriel's first game under center. He was overshadowed by David Njoku -- who led the team with nine targets -- but was a reliable short-area target for Gabriel. Fannin accounted for the Browns' first touchdown of the day with a one-yard catch midway through the first quarter, also the first of his career. He hasn't shown much upside, but Fannin could emerge as a favorite target of Gabriel in the quick-pass game.
#### Jake Ferguson (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Dak Prescott continues to lean heavily on the tight end while CeeDee Lamb (ankle) is sidelined. Ferguson was on the other end of two of the QB's four TD passes on the afternoon, hitting paydirt on a 26-yard strike and a one-yard toss in the second quarter as the Cowboys built a 23-3 lead before halftime. Over three games since Lamb went down, Ferguson has compiled a 27-171-3 line on 30 targets, and his seven receptions Sunday were a team high. He'll look to keep rolling in Week 6 against the Panthers.
#### George Pickens (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** The game was more lopsided than the final score might suggest -- Dallas took a 30-6 lead into the fourth quarter -- and Pickens wasn't needed for much volume as a result. He made his few looks count, however, burning Sauce Gardner for a 43-yard TD in the third quarter. Since CeeDee Lamb (ankle) got hurt early in Week 3, Pickens has erupted for a 15-259-4 line on 24 targets as Dak Prescott's most dangerous downfield threat. Whether he's able to continue that hot streak in Week 6 against the Panthers may depend largely on Lamb's health.
#### Jahmyr Gibbs (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Gibbs has showcased his versatility in the Lions' offense in the last two games, primarily working as a rusher in Week 4 before being excellent as a pass catcher in Sunday's win. His touchdown came on an impressive 20-yard yard catch and run on a quick screen, during which he weaved through traffic before barreling through several players to reach the end zone. David Montgomery saw the majority of work in the fourth quarter with Detroit in control of the game, but Gibbs has still found the end zone in four straight games while surpassing 85 scrimmage yards in each of those contests.
#### Woody Marks (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Marks rotated within drives with Nick Chubb for most of the game, but he still ended up with four fewer carries. Neither back was able to get much going, and three of Marks' seven carries went for one yard or less. While it was a disappointing follow-up to what appeared to be a breakout performance in Week 5, game script didn't help as Houston pulled most of its offensive starters early in the fourth quarter.
#### Michael Pittman Jr. (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** The veteran receiver finished second on the Colts in receptions during the lopsided victory, and although he averaged only 7.8 yards per catch, he rounded out his production nicely with a four-yard scoring grab late in the first half. Pittman has at least five receptions in four of the first five contests of the season, and although he continues to be used primarily in a short-area role, he's already recorded four touchdown catches, one more than he tallied across 16 regular-season games in 2024. Pittman will look to continue adding to that total in a Week 6 home matchup against the Cardinals.
#### Daniel Jones (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Jones' solid, efficient stat line was a fitting microcosm of what's come to define his body of work early in his Colts tenure, as the veteran signal-caller once again turned in a mistake-free effort that complemented the exploits of Jonathan Taylor and the defense perfectly. Jones worked with a tight circle of five targets overall, tossing his pair of touchdowns to Tyler Warren (11 yards) and Michael Pittman (four yards). Jones has completed a sharp 71.3 percent of his passes and posted a 6:2 TD:INT through his first five games at the helm of Indianapolis' offense, and he's added another three scores on the ground. Jones next takes aim at the Cardinals' defense in a Week 6 home clash.
#### Bhayshul Tuten (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Tuten has had his practice reps managed in each of the last three weeks of game prep, but he's still been available to the Jaguars offense on game days. While Travis Etienne has been a workhorse out of the backfield this season, Tuten has received regular touches, turning 21 carries into 88 yards and one touchdown and three catches (on four targets) for 40 yards and another score through four contests.
#### Tre' Harris (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Harris actually saw a season high in terms of snap percentage, but the extra work didn't get the rookie more opportunities. The Chargers could be in a few more favorable passing game scripts with the offensive line in tatters due to injuries, but it has yet to significantly unlock the 2025 second-round pick.
#### Justin Herbert (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Herbert did not look comfortable in the pocket without starting left tackle Joe Alt (ankle) on Sunday, finishing below 200 yards passing for the first time this season. The 27-year-old was sacked four times while throwing his fourth interception of the season, all of which have come during his current three-game skid. Things got so bad that head coach Jim Harbaugh turned to backup QB Trey Lance in garbage time of Sunday's loss. Herbert did salvage his fantasy day a bit by providing managers with a season high of 60 yards on the ground. The talented signal-caller will attempt to get his season back on track against the fledgling Dolphins next Sunday.
#### Davante Adams (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Adams edged Puka Nacua by three for the team lead in receiving yards, and he was one target behind his teammate for the top spot in that category as well. Adams' yardage and target tallies were also his best since Week 2 and second highest of the campaign in both cases. Nacua remains the clear alpha option in the Rams' air attack, but Adams' role as the No. 2 receiver is just as clearly delineated heading into a Week 6 road matchup against the Ravens on Sunday, Oct. 12.
#### T.J. Hockenson (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The veteran tight end continued to play a short-area role and finished as the runner-up in receptions for the Vikings while also tying for second in targets. Hockenson provided some key contributions on the Vikings' game-winning drive late in the fourth quarter, making two catches for 20 yards during the possession. He has between four and six receptions in his last three games, but he's yet to top 49 receiving yards in any contest this season heading into the Week 6 bye.
#### Drake Maye (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Maye continued his impressive development in Week 5 despite failing to score a touchdown for the first time this season. The sophomore signal-caller did the dirty work between the 20s, leading a pair of lengthy drives in the second half that RB Rhamondre Stevenson finished off with short rushing scores. Maye is completing an impressive 73.9 percent of his pass attempts through five starts, leading New England to a surprising 3-2 start to the campaign. The North Carolina product should continue offering starter-level production in fantasy in a road tilt against the Saints next Sunday.
#### Alvin Kamara (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** The 55 scrimmage yards were a season low for Kamara, and it's the third time in five games to begin the season that he's failed to reach 60. The veteran back is struggling to make an impact, as defenses haven't had much reason to fear the Saints' passing attack, but they could begin to loosen up for Kamara after QB Spencer Rattler hit Rashid Shaheed for an 87-yard TD in Sunday's win. Kamara will try to rebound in Week 6 against the Patriots.
#### Ricky Pearsall (WR)
**Injury Status:** Out <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** out
