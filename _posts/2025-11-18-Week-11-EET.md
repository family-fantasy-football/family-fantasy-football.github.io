## 🏥 Player Report

### 🔴 Drake London (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Doubtful<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> London also could miss additional time beyond that contest. With Atlanta's top wideout looking doubtful for Week 12, there would be additional pressure on Darnell Mooney to turn his poor season around, while David Sills, KhaDarel Hodge and Carlos Washington might see additional work. Falcons pass catchers will be working with Kirk Cousins moving forward after Michael Penix suffered a potentially season-ending knee injury in a Week 11 loss to the Panthers.
</div>

### 🟡 Justice Hill (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟡 Joshua Palmer (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 Courtland Sutton (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The veteran matched Troy Franklin in receptions and targets, but it was the second-year wideout who paced Denver with 84 receiving yards. Sutton has become the 1B to Franklin's 1A in the Broncos' passing game, and over the last six games he's posted a 19-284-1 line on 37 targets compared to Franklin's 25-278-4 line on 49 targets.
</div>

### 🟢 Trevor Lawrence (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Lawrence put together another lackluster stat line, but he leveraged the strong work of his ground game and defense for an easy win. Both of the fourth-year signal-caller's touchdowns came from one yard out, as he recorded a short scoring run with just under eight minutes remaining in the third quarter and had a short scoring toss to Tim Patrick early in the final period. Lawrence has now been under 200 passing yards in consecutive games and on four occasions overall this season, and he'll next face off with the inconsistent Cardinals defense in a Week 12 road matchup.
</div>

### 🟢 Jakobi Meyers (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> In his second game in a Jaguars uniform, Meyers operated as the team's WR1 due to the absence of Brian Thomas (ankle). Meyers finished Sunday's contest leading both teams in receptions and yards, though it was Tim Patrick who hauled in the Jaguars' lone touchdown pass from Trevor Lawrence. Meyers has an 8-97-0 line (on nine targets) through his first two games as a Jaguar and has accumulated 38 catches (on 55 targets) for 416 yards through eight regular-season games. His volume will likely take a hit if Thomas is cleared to return for Jacksonville's Week 12 road clash against Arizona next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Hollywood Brown (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The veteran finished second among Kansas City wideouts in receptions, behind Rashee Rice's six but ahead of Xavier Worthy's three. Brown hasn't seen more than four targets in any of the last five games, posting a 12-172-3 line on 17 targets during that stretch, but he's remained involved in the passing attack since Rice made his season debut. Brown will look to get back into the end zone for the first time since Week 7 in a Week 12 clash with the Colts.
</div>

### 🟢 Aaron Jones Sr. (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jones finished with a 19-6 edge in touches over Jordan Mason, but Mason scored a 16-yard rushing touchdown in the fourth quarter. Jones just missed scoring a touchdown of his own in the first quarter but failed to come down with a bobbling catch attempt on an acrobatic effort in the end zone. Heading into a Week 12 road game against his former team in Green Bay, Jones has reestablished himself as the top option in Minnesota's backfield.
</div>

### 🟢 Saquon Barkley (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Barkley had a rough go of things on the ground despite Philadelphia picking up another win, requiring a season-high 26 carries to reach Sunday's modest totals. The 28-year-old superstar has struggled out of his team's Week 9 bye, averaging 2.9 yards per carry with no touchdowns in those two contests. The good news for Barkley's managers is that the Eagles face the Cowboys' 29th-ranked rush defense next Sunday, a unit that has surrendered a whopping 143.0 yards per game to opposing rushers in 2025.
</div>

### 🔴 George Kittle (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Kittle welcomed back starting quarterback Brock Purdy (toe) with literal open arms, getting wide open in the end zone on two separate occasions. The talented duo picked up right where they left off when they last played together back in Week 1, when Kittle hit pay dirt before suffering a hamstring injury that would land the tight end on injured reserve. The 31-year-old Kittle was already coming off of a season-best performance against the Rams in Week 10 (9-84-1), with Sunday's two-score day officially putting the fantasy stud on a hot streak. Kittle will attempt to one-up himself against the Panthers under the bright lights of Monday Night Football in Week 12.
</div>

### 🟢 Brock Purdy (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Glazer added that Purdy experienced more than a typical setback after aggravating the toe injury in Week 4, though the quarterback was still able to avoid surgery. Purdy will be making his third start of the season Sunday, while Mac Jones returns to the backup role.
</div>

### 🟢 Rashid Shaheed (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Shaheed ran as the Seahawks' third wideout behind Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Cooper Kupp. Through two games with his new team, Shaheed has managed just three catches for 30 scoreless yards on six targets. He and Sam Darnold are undoubtedly still working on their timing, and it could take a couple weeks to get on the same page. Shaheed gets a plus Week 12 draw against the Titans next Sunday, but he classifies as a low-floor, high-ceiling WR4 fantasy bet.
</div>

### 🟢 Tony Pollard (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Pollard led the Titans' backfield with 13 touches to nine for Tyjae Spears. However, he was inefficient as both a receiver and a pass catcher, with his longest gain of the day going for only nine yards. Pollard has double-digit touches in every game this season, but this was his lowest yardage output of any contest.
</div>

### 🟢 Zach Ertz (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The veteran tight end tied Deebo Samuel for the team lead in targets, but the wideout did a lot more (7-74-1) with his volume. Ertz was also the intended target on Marcus Mariota's only interception of the afternoon on the first play of OT, setting up Miami's winning field goal. Ertz will head into a Week 12 bye with a 39-387-4 line on 57 targets, and his role in the offense seems secure regardless of whether Mariota or Jayden Daniels (elbow) is under center in Week 13 against the Broncos.
