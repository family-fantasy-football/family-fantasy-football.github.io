## Player Report

#### Marvin Harrison Jr. (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** After hooking up with Murray for a 15-yard catch in the preseason opener versus Kansas City, Harrison and the rest of the Cardinals' No. 1 offense sat out this past Saturday's game against Denver. Murray and Harrison connected on a number of passes against a tough Broncos secondary in a joint practice, however. Harrison is looking to build upon a 62-885-8 line on 116 targets over 17 regular-season games as a rookie, and the fourth overall pick in the 2024 Draft seems poised to break out based on early returns in training camp and the exhibition schedule.
#### Joe Burrow (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Burrow played in the first two preseason game, leading Cincinnati's offense to four touchdowns (including three TD passes) on five drives. He'll play at Cleveland in Week 1, mostly surrounded by the same supporting cast as last season, plus TE Noah Fant and two new guards (Dylan Fairchild, Lucas Patrick) that are competing for starting jobs. The Bengals appear shootout-prone again, with minimal offseason upgrades on defense and star DE Trey Hendrickson (contract) missing all of training camp.
#### J.K. Dobbins (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Dobbins' only touch of the night came on Denver's first possession, one play after his first target of the night fell incomplete but was wiped off the books by an illegal use of hands penalty against San Francisco. Dobbins was the only one of the top four backs on Denver's depth chart not to log a carry -- RJ Harvey, Audric Estime and Jaleel McLaughlin combined for 18 rush attempts -- but the veteran is almost certain to open the campaign in a prominent role and could certainly see more action in Denver's second preseason contest next Saturday night at home against the Cardinals.
#### Jared Goff (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** With Goff, who also didn't play in last Thursday's Hall of Fame Game against the Chargers, not slated to see action versus Atlanta, the report notes that Hendon Hooker is set to play the first half Friday, with Kyle Allen on track to play in the second half. Goff is entrenched as the Lions' starting QB ahead of Week 1, but according to Tim Twentyman of the team's official site, Hooker and Allen are in a close competition to back up Goff.
#### Romeo Doubs (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Doubs played for two offensive possessions along with other starters such as Matthew Golden, Tucker Kraft and Josh Jacobs. He caught his touchdown on a slant route on a pass from Malik Willis, who started the game for Green Bay. Most importantly, Doubs looks ready for the Packers' Week 1 matchup against the Lions after working through a back injury for much of the last two weeks.
#### Matthew Golden (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Golden played on the first two offensive possessions along with many of Green Bay's top skill-position players, such as Josh Jacobs, Romeo Doubs and Tucker Kraft. He made a long contested catch down the right sideline on a throw from Malik Willis, showcasing his playmaking ability that will be a welcomed addition to the Packers' receiving corps. Golden looks locked into an immediate role as a starting outside receiver heading into a Week 1 matchup against the Lions.
#### Jayden Higgins (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The Texans rested their starters, including Nico Collins and Christian Kirk, for their final exhibition contest, and Higgins made only a brief cameo on the team's first two drives before exiting. The 2025 second-round pick seems locked into the No. 3 spot on the depth chart due to Tank Dell (knee) still lacking a timeline for his return, and it's a role that could result in significant volume for Higgins in a high-ceiling passing game led by C.J. Stroud.
#### Travis Hunter (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Hunter missed Jacksonville's preseason finale due to an upper-body issue, but the team had consistently indicated that the injury was only minor. The rookie first-rounder is ready to make his regular-season debut Sunday, Sept. 7, though it remains to be seen exactly how the Jaguars intend to divvy up his snaps between offense and defense. Hunter has been listed as a starting wide receiver on the Jaguars' unofficial preseason depth charts, but the team's first official regular-season depth chart, to be released during Week 1 prep, will provide a clearer indication of the dual-threat playmaker's current standing on both sides of the ball.
#### Ashton Jeanty (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Jeanty logged the Raiders' first touch from scrimmage and shared time with Zamir White on the drive. Jeanty, the rookie first-round pick, had a relatively quiet first preseason as a pro, rushing 12 times for 37 yards and a touchdown while recording one catch for two yards over three games. That type of sparse usage should be a distant memory as soon as the regular season begins, as Jeanty is expected to handle a robust role in the Raiders' ground attack beginning with a Week 1 road matchup against the Patriots on Sunday, Sept. 7.
#### Omarion Hampton (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Hampton played in one series with the rest of the Chargers' starters and logged gains of five and seven yards. More importantly, he was the only back to appear with the starting offensive unit, which included Justin Herbert. Hampton is likely to be a part of a rotation at the start of the regular season, though it remains to be seen if he is paired with Najee Harris (eye) or one of a few other running backs vying for a role in the team's backfield.
#### Ollie Gordon II (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Gordon is fresh off an impressive preseason and is currently the only healthy running back on Miami's active roster, though Achane is expected to be ready for Week 1 despite not having practiced since Aug. 16. The team has added a pair of depth backfield options to the practice squad in Jeff Wilson and JaMycal Hasty, but after looking like the Dolphins' best running back in three consecutive preseason games, Gordon should be the favorite to handle any additional available backfield reps Week 1. If Achane ends up limited in practice leading up to the regular-season opener, it's possible Gordon is tasked with a significant workload.
#### Jaxson Dart (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Though the Giants had listed him behind Russell Wilson and Jameis Winston on depth charts throughout the preseason, Dart took reps ahead of Winston in all three of New York's exhibition contests, with the rookie first-round pick completing 32 of 47 attempts for 372 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions to go with six carries for 52 yards and another score. He now appears to have clinched the No. 2 job heading into Sunday's season opener in Washington. While Wilson should start for the Giants as long as he stays healthy and keeps the team competitive, Dart's excellent preseason could embolden the coaching staff to make a change if the veteran shows any signs of slippage.
#### Chig Okonkwo (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Okonkwo's lone catch came on a pass from rookie first overall pick Cameron Ward, who played two drives. Okonkwo appears to be locked in atop Tennessee's tight end depth chart, ahead of rookie fourth-round pick Gunnar Helm and last year's backup Josh Whyle. Tennessee's starters may see more extensive action in the team's second preseason game Friday against the Falcons.
