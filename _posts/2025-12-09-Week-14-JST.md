## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟡 Emari Demercado (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟡 Rome Odunze (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 D'Andre Swift (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Swift was stuck in a secondary role to Kyle Monangai in the first half, but he ended up with one more touch than the rookie. Swift didn't have any explosive plays -- his longest gain came on a 10-yard catch -- though he helped keep the Chicago offense on schedule while averaging 4.8 yards per carry. Despite slipping into a clear backfield split with Monangai, Swift has at least 80 yards from scrimmage in four of his last five games and will remain a key contributor in the Chicago offense.
</div>

### 🟢 Caleb Williams (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Bears had an abysmal first half, managing only 71 net yards on 28 offensive plays. Williams predictably played a significant role in that showing, as he had only 32 yards on 14 pass attempts.  However, he rebounded for a decent effort in the second half, recording three completions of at least 20 yards while also tallying a pair of one-yard passing scores. That was enough for Williams to turn in a passable fantasy performance -- particularly given the tough matchup -- but he ended the Bears' rally in the final minutes of the game with an interception in the end zone. Overall, Williams managed only his third multi-touchdown showing in his last six games, and he's also reached 200 passing yards in only half of those six matchups.
</div>

### 🔴 Jayden Reed (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Reed made a successful return to action Sunday after a pair of early-season injuries that required surgery kept him sidelined since Week 2. The 25-year-old finished in a three-way tie for the team lead in targets, which bodes well for his usage moving forward. The versatile receiver logged his first carries of the season after posting a 31-282-3 rushing line across his rookie and sophomore campaigns. With a sizeable role and good health in tow, Reed should find himself back on the fantasy map for next Sunday's tilt against the Broncos.
</div>

### 🟢 Travis Kelce (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Kelce was completely eliminated from Sunday's game plan, as he was held by Houston's dominant secondary to a season-low one reception. The Chiefs committed six drops altogether on Sunday Night Football, but none stood out more than the star tight end's late bobble that landed safely in the hands of the defense on his team's second-to-last possession. Kelce has provided fantasy managers with consistent weekly production outside of Sunday's dud, so a bounce-back outing could be in order against the Chargers next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Hunter Henry (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Henry co-led the Patriots in receptions while setting the pace in receiving yards and targets on the night. The veteran tight end also tied with running back Rhamondre Stevenson for the longest reception of the night (36 yards), and Henry now has 187 receiving yards and a touchdown on 11 catches over the last two games. Henry has flashed excellent chemistry with Drake Maye throughout the season, and the duo should remain busy in a Week 15 home showdown against the Bills on Sunday, Dec. 14 following a Week 14 bye.
</div>

### 🟢 Chris Olave (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Olave played through a back issue for the second straight week and put together a modest performance by his lofty standards, although Devaughn Vele was the Saints' leader in receiving yards with just 10 more than Olave. The fourth-year wideout's yardage tally was his second lowest of the season, but Olave managed to keep his season-long streak of no less than three catches in any game alive. Olave next takes aim at the Panthers secondary in a Week 15 home clash next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 DeVonta Smith (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Smith found himself acting as the third wheel for the Eagles' passing offense in Week 14 after fellow wideout A.J. Brown and TE Dallas Goedert commanded double-digit targets from QB Jalen Hurts. The 26-year-old Smith has seemingly fallen out of favor coming out of Philadelphia's Week 9 bye, posting averages of 4.0 receptions and 50.2 yards in those five outings. Perhaps a favorable matchup against the Raiders in Week 15 will reignite Smith in time for the fantasy playoffs.
</div>

### 🟢 Jalen Hurts (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> There is simply no other way to break it down, this was Hurts' worst performance of his otherwise impressive professional career. The 26-year-old tripled his season interception total with Monday's quartet of picks, and he even had a potential fifth one reversed following a replay review. To add insult to injury, a comedy of errors unfolded in the second quarter that resulted in Hurts scooping up a ball that a defender who intercepted his initial pass had fumbled away, only to have the ball stripped away from his arms by a Chargers' defender to give possession back to Los Angeles. The mobile quarterback has done a commendable job protecting the football prior to Monday's outburst of turnovers, so fantasy managers should not lose faith in Hurts ahead of a get-right matchup against Las Vegas in Week 15.
</div>

### 🟢 Will Shipley (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Clemson product received his first offensive touch since the Eagles' Week 10 win over the Packers and played ahead of Tank Bigsby (no touches on just one offensive snap) during Friday's loss, suggesting he may be emerging as the team's No. 2 running back. Shipley has now appeared in 10 games this season, recording 84 total yards on 16 touches while also accumulating 520 kick-return yards. He's likely to remain a minor factor in Philadelphia's offense in the Week 14 matchup against the Chargers.
</div>

### 🟡 DK Metcalf (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Metcalf took a hard hit during Sunday's contest, per the report, and he was sent to the hospital "out of an abundance of caution" after "experiencing stomach pains" once he'd boarded the Steelers' team flight. Metcalf wound up staying overnight in Baltimore for observation, but he was cleared to fly back to Pittsburgh on Monday. It's unclear how the injury will affect the wideout's status for a Week 15 matchup with the Dolphins, but he will be afforded an extra day to rest and recover before the Monday nighter.
</div>

### 🟢 Christian McCaffrey (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The 21 receiving yards represented his lowest total of the season, while the 74 scrimmage yards were his worst production since Week 8 as the 49ers offense struggled in bad weather against a tough Cleveland front seven. McCaffrey salvaged his day with a one-yard TD plunge to open the scoring in the first quarter however, his eighth rushing score and 13th total touchdown in 13 games. McCaffrey will get a breather during next week's bye before taking on a more vulnerable Titans defense in Week 15.
</div>

### 🟢 Rachaad White (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The veteran back gained just two fewer yards than backfield mate Bucky Irving on four less carries, putting together his third effort of over 4.8 yards per carry in the last four games. White continued to see a reduced pass-catching role, however, as he's now been held to two catches and 11 yards or fewer in three of the last four games. White does appear to be the clear No. 2 back over Sean Tucker despite the latter's touchdown Sunday, so the former retains value in deeper PPR formats heading into Thursday night's Week 15 home matchup against the Falcons.
</div>

### 🟢 Elic Ayomanor (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Ayomanor got off to a promising start when he took a 14-yard pass from Cam Ward into the end zone early in the first quarter. However, that was the extent of the rookie wideout's production, as he didn't catch either of the other two balls thrown his way. Ayomanor finished fourth on the Titans in targets behind WR Chimere Dike (eight), WR Van Jefferson (four) and RB Tyjae Spears (four). With just four catches on 14 targets for 30 yards combined over his past three games, Ayomanor will be a very shaky fantasy play in Week 15 versus the 49ers.
