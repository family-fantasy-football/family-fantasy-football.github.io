## Player Report

#### James Cook (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Josh Allen was the entire Buffalo offense, as he led the team in rushing attempts and yards while also scoring a trio of times on the ground from one yard away. Allen's usage combined with a negative game script left little opportunity for Cook, who saw his fewest rushing attempts of the season. More concerning was his lack of involvement as a receiver despite Allen taking to the air 37 times. Cook has now failed to reach 50 rushing yards in four of his last seven games.
#### Ty Johnson (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Johnson saw five opportunities on the ground for the second-straight game, but the veteran was unable to make much happen with his limited attempts. The 27-year-old played just 16 of the Bills' 58 offensive snaps, behind starter James Cook (26) and rookie Ray Davis (19). Barring injuries, Johnson should continue to be ignored for fantasy purposes as the Bills square off against the Rams in Week 14.
#### Xavier Legette (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** The rookie wideout had trouble hanging onto the ball all day, but Legette's biggest drop came in the fourth quarter when he couldn't haul in what might have been a game-winning 32-yard touchdown in the final minute. Legette has still caught multiple passes in eight straight games, posting a 26-281-3 line on 46 targets over that stretch. He'll try to put his volume to better use in Week 15 against the Cowboys.
#### CeeDee Lamb (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Lamb was confident earlier this week that he'd be able to play in the primetime matchup, and he's now poised to enter an incredibly enticing fantasy position as the primary focal point for an offense that likely will need to move the ball through the air. The All-Pro wideout has gutted through a difficult shoulder injury since Week 9 and has failed to play more than 83 percent of the snaps in all but one of the last four games as a result, but he's effectively in must-play territory regardless given how porous Cincinnati's defense has been against the pass all season.
#### Sam LaPorta (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** LaPorta tied multiple teammates for second in receptions and finished as the runner-up in receiving yards to Jameson Williams on the night. The talented tight end also matched Tim Patrick for second in targets during what was one of LaPorta's busiest games yet this season. The catch total was LaPorta's second highest of 2024, and the targets qualified as a new season high, sending him into a Week 15 home showdown against the Bills on Sunday, Dec. 15 with plenty of momentum.
#### Dontayvion Wicks (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Wicks tied Tucker Kraft for second in targets and Christian Watson for the team lead in receptions, although he was a distant second to the latter in receiving yards. Nevertheless, it was notable that Wicks logged four more targets than No. 1 receiver Jayden Reed, who went without a catch. Wicks has back-to-back four-reception outings heading into a Week 15 road matchup against the Seahawks on Sunday night, Dec. 15, but he could be looking at a reduced role if Romeo Doubs (concussion) returns for that game.
#### Hollywood Brown (WR)
**Injury Status:** Injured Reserve <br>
**Lineup Slot:** IR <br>
**Details:** Brown has been out all season after suffering a sternoclavicular joint injury to his left shoulder in the Chiefs' Aug. 10 preseason opener and then undergoing surgery in mid-September. Though initial reports after his surgery was performed suggested that Brown would likely miss the entire regular season, the wideout has seemingly avoided any setbacks thus far in the recovery process and looks like he'll have a chance to get in a few tune-up games before the playoffs get underway. If Brown's surgeon is satisfied with the health of his shoulder following the upcoming checkup, the Chiefs will likely open the receiver's 21-day practice window before mapping out a target date for his season debut. Rapoport notes that Brown could be ready for game action as soon as Week 16, when the Chiefs host the Texans on Dec. 21.
#### Justin Herbert (QB)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Herbert said he "took a shot there and was in some pain, but felt good to go and went back in" during Sunday Night Football. The franchise quarterback could be seen walking with a visible limp after Sunday's contest, but it doesn't appear as though he expects to still be dealing with any restrictions versus Tampa Bay in Week 15. Herbert completed 21 of 30 pass attempts for 213 yards and one touchdown versus Kansas City, in addition to taking four carries for 12 yards.
#### DeMario Douglas (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Douglas approached the contest listed as questionable, but played through the ankle issue that had limited him at practice. With the Patriots on bye in Week 14, Douglas may be able to avoid the team's Week 15 injury report. Either way, he figures to maintain enough volume down the stretch to merit lineup attention in PPR formats.
#### Rhamondre Stevenson (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** It was a solid performance from Stevenson, but his numbers would have been even better had Antonio Gibson not vultured a red-zone touchdown on an 11-yard run midway through the fourth quarter. Stevenson has gone seven straight games without reaching 80 rushing yards in a game, and the Patriots' offensive line woes have limited him to a rough 3.1 yards per carry over that stretch. The team's entire offense will get a breather, and a chance to solve some of its issues, over a Week 14 bye.
#### Drake Maye (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** It was a mostly efficient performance from the rookie quarterback, but Maye's red-zone INT late in the third quarter ended up being very costly in a one-point loss. He's been picked off at least once in five straight games, posting a 6:6 TD:INT over that stretch, but growing pains are to be expected from the third overall pick in the 2024 Draft. Maye will get a chance to regroup during the Patriots' Week 14 bye.
#### Kendre Miller (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Making his return to the lineup after a four-game absence due to a hamstring strain, Miller opened the scoring on the afternoon with an eight-yard score late in the first quarter. Alvin Kamara led the Saints' backfield with 22 touches, but Miller's 10 topped the five that Jamaal Williams handled, and the second-year back appears to be taking advantage of the clean slate he received when Dennis Allen was let go as head coach. Miller will look to build on this effort in Week 15 against the Commanders.
#### Saquon Barkley (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** The star running back reached 100 rushing yards for the fourth straight game and the 10th time this season, in the process setting a new Eagles record with 1,623 rushing yards on the year, topping LeSean McCoy's 1,607 yards from 2013. Barkley remains on track to top 2,000 yards on the season, and Eric Dickerson's NFL record of 2,105 yards is firmly in his sights. Barkley will look to keep rolling in Week 15 against the Steelers.
#### Jaylen Warren (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Warren was on the field for 52 percent of the Steelers' offensive snaps Sunday, outpacing Najee Harris' 42 percent and Cordarrelle Patterson's 14 percent. Warren responded by topping 50 yards from scrimmage for a seventh consecutive game, but Harris was the only Pittsburgh back to reach the end zone with a one-yard touchdown run in the second quarter. Warren has carved out a somewhat consistent fantasy role, but his ceiling is limited as long as he's sharing the backfield with Harris.
