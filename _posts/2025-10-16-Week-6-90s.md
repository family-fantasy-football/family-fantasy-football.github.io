## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Lamar Jackson (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Out<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jackson has missed Baltimore's last two games, but Harbaugh indicated Sunday that his hope and expectation is that the star QB will be available for the team's Oct. 26 game against the Bears. The looming return of Jackson, among others, in Week 8 offers hope that a turnaround can be engineering by the Ravens, who head into their bye week with a 1-5 record. Either way, if Jackson is healthy, he belongs in fantasy lineups.
</div>

### 🟢 Dillon Gabriel (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Gabriel was constantly under pressure, taking six sacks while averaging only 4.25 yards per attempt. Positively, he did continue to show a connection with fellow rookie tight end Harold Fannin, as the duo connected for a 25-yard gain -- the longest of the day for both Gabriel and the team. Gabriel should have the chance to put together a better performance in Week 7 when the Browns host the Dolphins.
</div>

### 🟢 Quinshon Judkins (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Browns fell behind early in the game and took to the air 52 times in a comeback effort. That limited Judkins' opportunity, and he also lost out on touches to Jerome Ford as a pass catcher. Judkins also suffered from an efficiency perspective, with his longest gain of the day going for only six yards. The Browns should be in a more neutral game script in Week 7 against Miami, so Judkins is likely to be in for a bounce-back performance.
</div>

### 🟢 Jameson Williams (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Williams finally put together a strong showing, leading the Lions in receiving yards while finding the end zone for the first time since Week 2. His touchdown catch was his longest of the day, as he caught a pass deep across the middle of the field before crashing through several defenders for a 22-yard score. Williams also tallied a pair of 15-yard gains to help him surpass 50 receiving yards in a game for only the second time this season.
</div>

### 🟢 Jonathan Taylor (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Taylor put together another signature stat line, averaging 5.9 yards per carry on his way to his second-highest rushing yardage total of the season. He also scored his fourth touchdown of the last two games on a one-yard rush with under five minutes remaining to erase a 27-24 deficit and put the final points of the day up on the board. Taylor is already sitting on 603 rushing yards, seven rush TDs and an average of 5.3 yards per carry through six contests, and he'll face the Chargers' porous run defense in a Week 7 road showdown next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟡 Brock Bowers (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Bowers is standing on the sideline in shorts, which comes as no surprise after reports this past weekend suggested he's unlikely to return for Week 7 at Kansas City. He initially suffered a PCL injury and bone bruise in Week 1, and it now seems the goal may be a return after the Raiders' Week 8 bye. TE Michael Mayer filled in admirably during Sunday's 20-10 win over Tennessee, catching five passes for 50 yards and a touchdown on a team-high seven targets (while playing 91 percent of snaps on offense).
</div>

### 🟢 Kimani Vidal (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Despite reports earlier this week Vidal and Hassan Haskins would be a part of a committee, the second-year back proved definitively he was the more explosive player by tallying 138 total yards on 21 touches to Haskins' 23 yards on seven opportunities. Omarion Hampton (ankle) is expected to be out at least a month, and while the Chargers have reportedly been sniffing around available options according to NFL.com's Ian Rapoport, Vidal's massive outing might quiet the trade calls for another week. It's worth noting Miami's run defense is one of the worst in the league, and it should be tougher sledding at home against the Colts next week.
</div>

### 🟢 Tua Tagovailoa (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Tagovailoa's turnover issues persisted in the narrow loss, although the last of his three interceptions came on a last-gasp play to close out the contest. The 2020 first-round pick's first two INTs were much more ill-timed, as Tagovailoa short-circuited drives at the Chargers' 39-yard line and his own 37, which led to 10 points for Los Angeles. Tagovailoa did lead Miami to two fourth-quarter touchdown drives and capped the second one off with a seven-yard scoring toss to Darren Waller with 46 seconds remaining, but he also undeniably played a direct part in the Dolphins falling to 1-5. Tagovailoa's Week 7 matchup is far from ideal in terms of his quest to atone for the turnover-filled performance, as a road trip to Cleveland to face the Browns' aggressive defense awaits.
</div>

### 🟢 Jaylen Waddle (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Waddle fell just short of his second consecutive 100-yard effort, but he still led the Dolphins in receptions, receiving yards and targets on the afternoon. The 2021 first-round pick has unsurprisingly seen an uptick in involvement during the first two full games Miami has played without Tyreek Hill (IR, knee), posting a combined 12-205-1 receiving line on 17 targets in that pair of contests. Waddle's clear-cut No. 1 receiver role should persist in a Week 7 road matchup against a talented Browns defense.
</div>

### 🟢 Jordan Addison (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Kevin Seifert of ESPN.com reported Addison was subject to a first-quarter benching for undisclosed reasons, but the third-year wideout ultimately would make up for lost time in clutch fashion. Addison was efficient with his opportunities, and the bulk of those came at the tail end of the Vikings' game-winning drive late in the fourth quarter. Addison was on the receiving end of each of Carson Wentz's final three completions and totaled 21 yards on those catches, the last which was a go-ahead 12-yard touchdown grab. For his part, Addison conceded afterward that he wasn't sure if he'd even be able to play in the game, per Seifert, but he made good on his vow to be ready if he did step on the field. Following the completion of his season-opening three-game suspension, Addison has immediately played a key part in Minnesota's air attack with a 9-155-1 line on 14 targets over his first two contests. He'll now prepare to play his first 2025 game stateside following the Week 6 bye when the Vikings host the Eagles on Sunday, Oct. 19 in a contest that could also provide Addison his first regular-season opportunity to work with J.J. McCarthy (ankle) as his quarterback.
</div>

### 🟢 Jordan Mason (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Mason's rushing opportunities were limited, but he locked in a solid fantasy day with a three-yard touchdown run to cap off the first drive of the second half. The offseason addition generally found tough sledding on the ground outside of the short score and his game-long 14-yard run, but he continued to keep Minnesota's ground attack viable in the ongoing absence of Aaron Jones (IR, hamstring). Mason should be in line to remain the lead back when the Vikings come out of the Week 6 bye with a Week 7 home matchup against the Eagles on Sunday, Oct. 19.
</div>

### 🔴 Garrett Wilson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Doubtful<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Wilson also logged a 'DNP' on Wednesday, and though coach Aaron Glenn hasn't ruled out the wideout for Sunday's game against the Panthers, ESPN's Adam Schefter previously reported that Wilson is expected to miss a couple of weeks after hyperextending his knee in Week 6. While Wilson is trending in the wrong direction ahead of the weekend, fellow WR Josh Reynolds (hip) participated in practice Thursday after missing Wednesday's session.
</div>

### 🟢 Jaylen Warren (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Warren returned from a one-game absence caused by a knee injury with his role in question due to competition from Kenneth Gainwell. Warren comfortably led the team with 11 carries, though he gave up a considerable amount of work to Gainwell in the receiving game. He was efficient with his work, but Warren appears to be the leader of a committee in Pittsburgh rather than a true lead back for the time being.
</div>

### 🟡 Jauan Jennings (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jennings played through five broken ribs, among other health concerns, during the 49ers' loss to Tampa Bay in Week 6, a contest in which he handled 77 percent of offensive snaps but secured just one of three targets for seven yards. While Jennings may again manage to play through his injuries at home against the Falcons on Sunday, he's combined for just three grabs for 31 yards (on seven targets) in his last two appearances. Meanwhile, Ricky Pearsall (knee) and Skyy Moore (undisclosed) are not practicing Wednesday.
</div>

### 🟢 AJ Barner (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Barner finished in the relatively unfamiliar position of second in receiving yardage and tied with Jaxon Smith-Njigba for the longest reception of the game. That catch covered a distance of 61 yards on the first play of Seattle's game-clinching drive, with Barner getting loose down the middle of the field after making the reception and taking the ball down to the Jaguars' 12-yard line. Barner has now set new single-game season highs in receiving yards in three consecutive contests, but he's typically much more of a shorter-area target for Sam Darnold and will remain a complementary pass-catching option in a tough Week 7 home matchup against the Texans on Monday night, Oct. 20.
</div>

### 🟢 Tyjae Spears (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Spears more than doubled his total touches in his second game back from an ankle injury. Tony Pollard (10-34-0) still spearheaded the Titans' backfield, but the gap in touch distribution inched even closer Sunday. The speedy backup will continue vying for more snaps against the Patriots next Sunday.
