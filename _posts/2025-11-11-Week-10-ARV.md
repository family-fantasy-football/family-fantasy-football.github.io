## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Bijan Robinson (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> While the third-year back posted his best rushing yardage total since Week 6, he was denied a much bigger performance, as Tyler Allgeier punched in a pair of one-yard TDs in his place. Robinson hasn't scored a rushing touchdown in four straight games, his longest drought since his rookie season, as a result of the increased red-zone usage for his backup, and he has just two rushing scores on the year compared to Allgeier's six. Robinson will try to hit paydirt in Week 11 against the Panthers, a team he's scored five total touchdowns against (four on the ground, one through the air) in five career meetings.
</div>

### 🟢 Xavier Legette (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The second-year wideout from South Carolina went without a catch for the first time this season in the Week 10 loss. He was overshadowed by Tetairoa McMillan and Jalen Coker, who led Carolina's wide receivers with 60 and 21 yards, respectively. Since Legette's breakout performance in the Week 7 win over the Jets (9-92-1), he's caught just three of seven targets for 39 yards over the past three games. With the Panthers' passing attack continuing to struggle, Legette likely won't carry much fantasy value in the Week 11 matchup against the Falcons.
</div>

### 🟢 Colston Loveland (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Loveland finished second on the team in receiving yards behind Rome Odunze (86), though this was a substantial step back from Loveland after the rookie first-round pick broke out for 118 yards and two touchdowns in the Week 9 win over the Bengals. Prior to Week 9, Loveland hadn't exceeded 38 receiving yards in a game, but he looks to have surpassed Cole Kmet as the go-to pass catcher among Chicago's tight ends heading into a Week 11 road matchup against the Vikings.
</div>

### 🟢 Dylan Sampson (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Browns' backfield clearly belongs to Quinshon Judkins, while Sampson has emerged as the No. 2 back ahead of veteran Jerome Ford. For the second consecutive game, Sampson was given more opportunities (22 snaps, three touches, three targets) than Ford (14, one, one). Cleveland has accepted its fate and is looking toward the future, which means a focus on youth for the remainder of a season. Should Judkins get injured, Sampson could earn more than just a handful of touches per game, but for now his fantasy utility is mainly limited to formats that value return yards.
</div>

### 🟢 Jaydon Blue (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> 
</div>

### 🟢 Kalif Raymond (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Raymond posted season highs in both receptions and receiving yards in Week 10 after he had reeled in just three of four targets for 17 total yards over the team's last four games. The wide receiver remains the team's No. 3 option at his position behind Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jameson Williams, and considering Sunday represented high-water marks for 31-year-old, his fantasy value remains rather low.
</div>

### 🟢 Parker Washington (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The seven targets led the Jaguars, and while Washington wasn't particularly efficient with the volume, he was on the other end of Trevor Lawrence's only TD pass of the afternoon, a seven-yard toss in the first quarter. Washington's 73-yard punt return to the house in the second quarter was also the second of his career. The third-year wideout has seen 26 targets over the last three games while Travis Hunter (knee) and now Brian Thomas (ankle) are on the shelf, and the addition of Jakobi Meyers hasn't yet impacted Washington's volume. That could change as Meyers gets acclimated to his new offense and once Thomas is able to return, but if those things take longer than expected, Washington should be busy again in Week 11 against the Chargers.
</div>

### 🟢 Brashard Smith (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Smith failed to capitalize on the absence of Isiah Pacheco (knee), finishing the loss with just three total touches. Kareem Hunt (11-49-1) finished as Kansas City's only fantasy-relevant back Sunday. With a bye week upcoming, Smith could find himself back in the No. 3 spot on the depth chart if Pacheco is ready to return for a Nov. 16 matchup against the Broncos.
</div>

### 🟡 Geno Smith (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Smith played through the injury for most of the fourth quarter, but he drew a questionable tag in the final minutes of the game and was spotted with his quad area wrapped on the bench. He'll now have 10 days to recover before a Week 11 matchup against the Cowboys, and there doesn't appear to be concern about his availability for that matchup for the time being.
</div>

### 🟢 Kyren Williams (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Williams followed up his first 100-yard rushing game of the season last week with his first multiple rushing touchdown performance of 2025. Blake Corum remained involved with 13 carries for 56 yards, but Williams continues to outproduce the backup while handling the important touches around the goal line. Expect the Rams to lean on Williams and their other top offensive weapons in a potential shootout against the red-hot Seahawks next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Puka Nacua (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Nacua showed no ill effects from the minor chest injury he picked up in last week's contest, rewarding managers with his second score in as many appearances. Co-star Davante Adams (oblique) picked up a minor injury at the tail end of the win, but early indications point toward both superstar wideouts being available for next Sunday's NFC West showdown against the Seahawks. Nacua is putting together another strong fantasy campaign, compiling 830 yards from scrimmage and five total touchdowns across the eight games in which he's played.
</div>

### 🟢 Cade Otton (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Otton led the Buccaneers in receptions and was second to Emeka Egbuka in both receiving yards and targets. All three components of the tight end's receiving line also qualified as season highs, and he's now exceeded 50 receiving yards in four of the last five games. Given both Chris Godwin (fibula) and Bucky Irving (foot/shoulder) could remain out for next Sunday's Week 11 road matchup against the Bills -- while Mike Evans (IR, collarbone/concussion) remains on injured reserve -- Otton may have another busy afternoon.
</div>

### 🟢 Emeka Egbuka (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Egbuka reemerged as a force in the air attack after a quiet three-game stretch during which he topped out at four catches and 58 receiving yards in terms of single-game highs. The rookie first-round pick led the Bucs in both receiving yards and targets while checking in second in receptions to Cade Otton. The ongoing absences of Chris Godwin (fibula) and Mike Evans (IR, collarbone/concussion) continues to afford the Ohio State product the chance to serve as Baker Mayfield's top wide-receiver target, and even if Godwin manages to return for next Sunday's Week 11 matchup against the Bills, Egbuka figures to retain a sizeable role.
</div>

### 🔴 Calvin Ridley (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 Deebo Samuel (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Commanders attempted only 22 passes, leaving no pass catcher with more than five targets. That limited the upside for any individual player, though Samuel was even more limited with only short-area targets. He now has fewer than 45 yards in four straight games, with only a four-yard touchdown catch midway through the third quarter saving his performance. Samuel's production is likely to remain volatile so long as Jayden Daniels (shoulder) is sidelined.
