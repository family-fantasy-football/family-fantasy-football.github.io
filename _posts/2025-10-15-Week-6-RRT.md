## Player Report

#### Trey McBride (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** McBride finished as the Cardinals' leader in receptions and targets and checked in just behind Zay Jones in receiving yards while working with Jacoby Brissett as his quarterback in the absence of Kyler Murray (foot). The veteran tight end's reception and yardage totals also were new season highs, and his target tally tied a high-water mark he'd reached two games prior against the Seahawks. Despite the superior production and his second TD catch of the season, McBride's day ended in frustration when he didn't get a pass interference call in the end zone he felt was warranted on the Cardinals' final play of the contest, a pass that fell incomplete. With talk of a potential multi-game absence for Murray, McBride's evident chemistry with Brissett is encouraging heading into a daunting Week 7 home matchup against the Packers next Sunday afternoon.
#### DeAndre Hopkins (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Baltimore's passing game was limited under the direction of Cooper Rush and Tyler Huntley on Sunday, but an underlying detail from the game was Hopkins' playing time ticking up. Hopkins played a season-high 26 snaps, which was good for 33 percent of the plays. He also had a season-high four targets. Baltimore is on a bye in Week 7, but given that Hopkins has been excellent on a per-target basis (13.7 YPT), it would not be surprising to see his role continue on an upward trend, especially when Lamar Jackson returns.
#### Chuba Hubbard (RB)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** questionable
#### Ja'Marr Chase (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Chase got a change in quarterback with Joe Flacco under center, and he logged his highest target total since Joe Burrow (toe) has been sidelined. The Packers did a good job limiting his production for most of the game, though Chase eventually managed to break through for long catches of 12, 18 and 19 yards in the second half, the final of which went for an acrobatic touchdown late in the fourth quarter. The performance gives some hope that Chase will remain a reliable fantasy contributor even in the absence of Burrow, as he has now found the end zone and topped 100 receiving yards in consecutive contests.
#### David Montgomery (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Montgomery nearly had a one-yard passing touchdown on the opening possession of the game to Jared Goff, but the score was nullified by an illegal motion penalty on Detroit. With the team falling behind early, the running back never really was able to establish himself on the ground, logging a season-low four totes. Montgomery will look to bounce back Week 7 against the Buccaneers.
#### Dalton Schultz (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Schultz was C.J. Stroud's favorite target in the first half, recording four receptions on four targets for 53 yards. Schultz played a key role on multiple scoring drives for Houston, recording 11- and 12-yard receptions to keep a pair of possessions alive on third down before logging a 21-yard catch to set up a touchdown just before halftime. This was Schultz's highest yardage total of the season, and he has five receptions in three consecutive contests.
#### Josh Downs (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Downs' day got off on the right foot with receptions of nine, 11 and five yards on the opening drive, and he ultimately added his first touchdown catch of the season on a five-yard grab early in the fourth quarter. Downs has back-to-back six-catch efforts heading into a Week 7 road matchup against the Chargers, and he's logged at least five targets in three consecutive contests.
#### Travis Etienne Jr. (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Etienne was absolutely stonewalled on the ground by a talented Seahawks front seven, although he was able to partly atone for the shortfall with a solid day through the air that saw him post new season highs in receptions, receiving yards and targets. The fifth-year back now has back-to-back 12-carry tallies after opening the season with at least 14 rush attempts in each of the first four games, but he remains the Jaguars' unquestioned No. 1 back and next faces a Rams defense that was gashed by the Ravens' Derrick Henry in Week 6.
#### Hassan Haskins (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Haskins was supposed to be part of a committee with Kimani Vidal replacing the injured Omarion Hampton (IR, ankle), but Vidal quickly proved to be the far more explosive back and ran away with the workload in the second half, finishing with 124 rushing yards and 14 receiving yards plus a touchdown. That's about as definitive of a difference as one could envision and likely means Haskins, who has primarily been a special-teams player during his time with the Chargers, could get squeezed out of platoon work after Vidal's amazing efforts. It's worth noting Miami's run defense is one of the worst in the league, and the Chargers could lean on the bruising Michigan product in short-yardage situations in future weeks.
#### Matthew Stafford (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Stafford had a fairly efficient performance, but it was a tough day for the Rams' offense as a whole. They possessed the ball for only 22:05 while also running their offense with a hobbled Puka Nacua (ankle) for nearly three-quarters of the contest. As a result, Stafford failed to throw for multiple touchdowns for the first time since Week 1 and also turned in his lowest yardage total of the season. His outlook for Week 7 against the Jaguars will depend relatively heavily on Nacua's availability.
#### Rhamondre Stevenson (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** The fifth-year RB avoided committing another fumble, but that was about the only silver lining to his performance. Stevenson has failed to reach 40 rushing yards in four straight games, producing a woeful 2.7 YPC over that stretch, and only a couple Week 5 rushing TDs have salvaged any real fantasy value for him during that span. TreVeyon Henderson hasn't had much more success, so the duo will likely continue to work in a timeshare in Week 7 against the Titans.
#### Spencer Rattler (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The second-year QB didn't commit a turnover for the fifth time in six starts to begin the season, but Rattler also wasn't able to produce a touchdown as the Saints had to settle for four Blake Grupe field goals, as well as a one-yard TD run from Taysom Hill. Rattler's 8.7 YPA on Sunday was a season high, as were his 227 passing yards. He'll take a 6:1 TD:INT into a Week 7 matchup against the Bears.
#### A.J. Brown (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** This comes with the territory for a big market team that's the defending Super Bowl champs, but the drama surrounding the Eagles' key offensive players has been exhausting. However, it's prudent to remember how the Eagles' offense was also off-kilter at this point in the season last year, too.
#### Cooper Kupp (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Kupp got into the end zone for the first time as a member of the Seahawks, recording an 11-yard touchdown grab early in the third quarter. The veteran wideout remains a distant No. 2 in the offense's pecking order behind No. 1 receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba, who had another prolific afternoon Sunday and has logged 56 targets to Kupp's 32. Kupp has now been under 60 receiving yards for four straight games heading into a challenging Week 7 home matchup against the Texans on Monday night, Oct. 20.
#### Sam Darnold (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Darnold looked as impressive as usual outside the friendly confines of Lumen Field, averaging 10.9 yards per attempt as he remained aggressive downfield. The veteran signal-caller once again focused the majority of his attention on Jaxon Smith-Njigba, who ended up on the receiving end of half of Darnold's completions and 162 of his yards, not to mention one of his two touchdowns, a perfectly thrown 61-yard strike in the second quarter. Darnold added a nifty 11-yard scoring toss to Cooper Kupp in the fourth quarter, and he'll head into a Week 7 home clash with the Texans on Monday night, Oct. 20 having thrown for multiple touchdowns in four of the last five games.
#### Jaxon Smith-Njigba (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Smith-Njigba was in the familiar position of leading the Seahawks' air attack in receptions, receiving yards and targets, posting a new season high in the middle category along the way. His catch total also tied for second highest of the season, and he added three more grabs of 20-plus yards, the most prominent a 61-yard touchdown on a beautifully thrown ball from QB Sam Darnold. The third-year star now has back-to-back 100-yard tallies for the second time this season and takes a robust 42-696-3 receiving line into a Week 7 home matchup against the Texans on Monday night, Oct. 20.
