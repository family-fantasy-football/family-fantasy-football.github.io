## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Lamar Jackson (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Making his return from a three-game absence, Jackson turned in one of his signature efficient performances in front of his hometown crowd. The two-time MVP didn't show any evidence of rust, throwing a two-yard touchdown pass to Mark Andrews to cap off a short second possession for Baltimore set up by a Tahj Washington fumble. Jackson connected with Andrews again from 20 yards out in the second quarter before launching scoring strikes to Charlie Kolar (three yards) and Rashod Bateman (nine yards) in the third quarter on the way to a comfortable win. The game marked Jackson's second of four touchdown passes this season, as well as his fourth with a 70.0 percent or better completion rate. Apparently back to full health, Jackson regains his status as an elite fantasy option heading into an intriguing Week 10 road interconference matchup against the Vikings on Sunday, Nov. 9.
</div>

### 🟡 Quinshon Judkins (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Judkins was forced out of Sunday's loss to the Patriots in the third quarter, prior to which he rushed nine times for 19 yards and secured all three of his targets for minus-2 yards. To see the rookie second-round pick now labeled day-to-day is encouraging as to his odds of being ready to return to action after Cleveland's Week 9 bye, when the team will travel to face the Jets on Sunday, Nov. 9. If Judkins isn't ready to retake the field Week 10, however,  Jerome Ford and Dylan Sampson will lead the Browns backfield. Ian Rapoport of NFL Network reports that Judkins is dealing with an AC joint sprain.
</div>

### 🟢 Dillon Gabriel (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Gabriel had a few good moments during Cleveland's 32-13 loss to the Patriots, including a pair of touchdown strikes, his first since Week 5. Unfortunately for the Browns, the rookie threw two interceptions and was whistled for a safety in the fourth quarter when he intentionally grounded a pass while in his own end zone. If Stefanski eventually makes a change, Gabriel would likely be replaced by Shedeur Sanders, who was inactive Week 8 due to a back injury,
</div>

### 🟢 Jameson Williams (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Williams was surprisingly shut out altogether during the Lions' Week 7 win over the Buccaneers, but after some bye-week chatter from the coaching staff about making it a priority to get him the ball, the fleet-footed wideout delivered a solid performance. Williams' yardage total tied for his second highest of the campaign, and his 37-yard touchdown down the left sideline that he finished with a full extension was his third of the season. Williams will have a positive outlook going into a Week 10 road matchup against the Commanders, who'll enter their Week 9 Sunday night matchup against the Seahawks allowing an NFL-high 12.0 yards per completion.
</div>

### 🟢 Nico Collins (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The star wideout returned from a one-game absence due to a concussion, and he took advantage of Patrick Surtain (pectoral) being missing from the Denver secondary by leading Houston in catches and targets. Collins' production took a hit when C.J. Stroud (concussion) was knocked out of the game in the second quarter, however. Collins remained the top option for Davis Mills, but he doesn't have the same chemistry with the team's backup QB. If Stroud remains sidelined in Week 10 against the Jaguars, Collins may be more of a floor than a ceiling play for fantasy purposes despite his 33-414-3 line on 57 targets through seven games this season.
</div>

### 🟢 Jonathan Taylor (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Taylor has been unstoppable most of the season, but he was underwhelming in Sunday's loss. He was limited to only 3.2 yards per carry with a long gain of nine, though the Colts were also forced to take to the air as they faced a two-score deficit for nearly the entire second half. That limited Taylor's volume and led to his lowest yardage output of the season. This was also the first time he didn't find the end zone since Week 4.
</div>

### 🟢 Brock Bowers (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Bowers burst back onto the fantasy scene with three trips to the end zone for his managers after missing the Raiders' last three contests with a knee injury. The explosive tight end notched his second 100-yard game of the season while recording his first rush attempt in 2025 (he logged five attempts as a rookie). Bowers made up for lost time with Sunday's outpouring of production, bumping his receiving line up to 31-357-3 in five starts. With no setbacks to report, Bowers will attempt to become a matchup problem for Denver's highly-touted defense on Thursday Night Football in Week 10.
</div>

### 🟢 Oronde Gadsden II (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Justin Herbert distributed targets extremely evenly among all of his top pass catchers, including Gadsden. Even so, Gadsden narrowly led the team in receiving yards, thanks primarily to a long 34-yard catch that came just short of the end zone. This was the fourth consecutive game that Gadsden has had at least five receptions and 65 receiving yards, and he's quickly become a reliable starting tight end in all formats.
</div>

### 🟢 Kimani Vidal (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Vidal had high expectations entering this favorable matchup, but he instead might have ceded clear lead-back duties while Omarion Hampton (ankle) remains sidelined. Vidal led the Chargers backfield in carries 8-2 at halftime, but he was out-carried by Jarrett Patterson 7-4 in the final two quarters. While it's possible that had to do with game script, the Chargers only briefly held a two-score lead and Patterson was also more effective with his work. Vidal should remain in fantasy consideration so long as Hampton is out, but his role is a bit murkier moving forward.
</div>

### 🟢 Jaylen Waddle (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Waddle tied for the team lead in receptions with De'Von Achane while setting the pace in receiving yards and finishing second in targets. It was the second productive game in the last five days for the fifth-year receiver, who posted a 5-99-1 line on six targets versus the Falcons on Sunday. Waddle has exceeded 80 receiving yards in four of the last five games overall, and he should continue to fill a clear No. 1 role in a typically concentrated Dolphins air attack when the Bills come to town for a Week 10 matchup on Sunday, Nov. 9.
</div>

### 🟢 Tua Tagovailoa (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Tagovailoa's completion percentage and passing yardage numbers weren't objectionable from a fantasy standpoint, but his real-world impact on the Dolphins offense was middling. To be fair, Tagovailoa also was victimized by a couple of fumbles -- the second by Malik Washington early in the fourth quarter on the Ravens' 11-yard line to short-circuit a 12-play, 81-yard drive -- as well as a missed field goal by Riley Patterson. Tagovailoa now has sandwiched a pair of games with zero touchdown passes around the four scoring tosses he recorded against the Falcons in Week 8, and he's up to 11 interceptions on the campaign heading into a Week 10 home matchup against the Bills on Sunday, Nov. 9.
</div>

### 🟢 Jordan Addison (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Addison's yardage total, modest as it was, led the Vikings on the afternoon, and he also made good use on his one rush attempt. The third-year wideout exceeded the 100-yard mark in two of his first three games after starting his season in Week 4 due to a suspension, but he's posted a modest 5-74-1 receiving line on eight targets over the last pair of contests. Sunday marked the first opportunity J.J. McCarthy and Addison had to work together in a regular-season setting, so the duo should continue building chemistry in a Week 10 home matchup against the Ravens.
</div>

### 🟢 Jordan Mason (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Mason opened the game splitting work as customary with Aaron Jones, but the latter's exit early in the third quarter due to a shoulder injury afforded more opportunity for the former. Mason still found running room mostly at a premium against a talented Lions run defense, and while Jones' inability to return to the game would seemingly portend a potentially serious injury, Tom Pelissero of NFL Network reports the veteran back has an AC joint sprain and believes he'll be available for a Week 10 home matchup against the Ravens.
</div>

### 🔴 Garrett Wilson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 Jaylen Warren (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Warren dominated rushing opportunity out of the Pittsburgh backfield, accounting for 16 of 21 attempts by running backs. He was equally inefficient with the chances, with his longest rush of the game going for only eight yards. Warren continues to concede targets to Kenneth Gainwell, though he seemingly strengthened his grip on the goal-line role by punching in a pair of scores from one and two yards, respectively. Warren has had an up-and-down season, but he's generally found a way to turn in productive performances.
</div>

### 🟢 Jauan Jennings (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jennings continues to gut it out while playing through multiple injuries, but he has reportedly started to feel healthier in recent weeks, which is supported by an uptick in production. He has notched four receptions in three consecutive games after reaching that threshold only once through Week 6. Jennings scored his second touchdown of the season on an 11-yard catch in the second quarter. It remains to be seen if he'll be catching passes from Mac Jones again in Week 10 against the Rams or if Brock Purdy (toe) will be back under center.
</div>

### 🟢 Tyjae Spears (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Spears was out-touched only 13-12 by Tony Pollard, with Spears being the primary pass catcher. His most notable contribution was a 26-yard catch that set up a game-tying field goal late in the second quarter. That made up for Spears' lack of efficiency on the ground, as he was held to less than 4.0 yards per carry for the first time since his season debut in Week 5. Positively, Spears has at least three catches in four straight games while also seeing an uptick in his usage as a ball carrier.
