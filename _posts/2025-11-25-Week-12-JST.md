## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟡 Emari Demercado (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 Michael Penix Jr. (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Injured Reserve<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> With Penix set for season-ending surgery, Kirk Cousins will take over as the Falcons' new starting quarterback beginning with Sunday's game in New Orleans. Even though Penix's estimated nine-month recovery timeline would give him a chance to be ready to play by Week 1 of the 2026 campaign, head coach Raheem Morris acknowledged that Penix's medical history will likely prompt the team to make alternative plans at quarterback -- whether that's retaining Cousins or bringing aboard someone else -- this coming offseason as a safeguard. During his time in college, Penix previously underwent surgeries to repair the ACL in his right knee in 2018 and 2020, and he also had two other seasons end early due to joint injuries to each of his shoulders.
</div>

### 🟢 D'Andre Swift (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> As his final rushing line indicates, Swift was absolutely stonewalled on the ground, and to make matters worse, he also lost a fumble in Steelers territory early in the second quarter. The turnover didn't lead to any Pittsburgh points, but backfield mate Kyle Monangai notably outpaced Swift in carries by four and also scored a rushing touchdown. Whether the developments signal a changing of the guard remains to be seen, but both backs have a tough matchup against Swift's former Eagles squad on the road on Black Friday.
</div>

### 🟢 Rome Odunze (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Odunze was second in receiving yards for the Bears on the afternoon, but his day could have been appreciably bigger with an uptick in efficiency. Nevertheless, the second-year wideout eclipsed 50 receiving yards for the third time in five games, all contests in which he's drawn at least nine targets. Odunze should be busy again in a Week 13 road matchup against the Eagles on Black Friday.
</div>

### 🟢 Caleb Williams (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Williams wasn't at his most efficient, but he still put together a rewarding fantasy effort thanks to his trio of scoring tosses. The 2024 first overall pick connected with DJ Moore (five, 25 yards) and Colston Loveland (12 yards) for his touchdown passes, recording his fourth multi-TD effort through the air this season. There's no question head coach Ben Johnson's tutelage and scheme have both done plenty to advance Williams' game in the latter's sophomore NFL campaign, but he'll still head into a Week 13 road showdown against the Eagles on Black Friday completing just 59.2 percent of his passes through 11 games.
</div>

### 🔴 Jayden Reed (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Injured Reserve<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Reed was limited in his return to practice last Friday, so while Green Bay isn't actually hosting an on-field session Monday, it's no surprise that the third-year pro isn't yet ready to handle reps without restrictions. It's possible Reed will need to log at least one full practice Tuesday and/or Wednesday in order to have a chance at coming off IR in time to suit up versus Detroit on Thanksgiving Day. In the event that Thursday's turnaround is too short a window for Reed, he should have a solid chance to return Week 14 against the Bears on Sunday, Dec. 7.
</div>

### 🟢 Travis Kelce (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The yardage total was his lowest since Week 3, but Kelce did record at least four receptions for the fourth straight game, a stretch in which he's delivered a 23-299-2 line on 32 targets. The veteran tight end remains a key part of the Kansas City passing game at age 36, and Kelce could be busier in Week 13 during a Thanksgiving clash with the Cowboys.
</div>

### 🟢 Hunter Henry (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The veteran tight end led the Patriots in receptions, targets and yards, capping his big day with a 28-yard TD from Drake Maye in the second quarter. It's the first 100-yard game for Henry since Week 2 of last season, and he's amassed a 41-537-5 line on 63 targets through 12 contests in 2025. He'll look to keep rolling in Week 13 against the Giants.
</div>

### 🟢 Chris Olave (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Olave stayed hot coming out of the Saints' bye week despite his team finding itself back in the loss column after beating the Panthers in Week 10. The 25-year-old generated a stellar PPR score on the backs of his second-highest target and reception totals of 2025. The Ohio State product continues to display a good rapport with rookie QB Tyler Shough, with the duo producing 17 receptions for 231 yards and a touchdown in the three games the latter has started this season. Olave should be treated as a starting-caliber receiver with a high fantasy floor in next Sunday's road tilt against Miami.
</div>

### 🟢 Will Shipley (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The 23-year-old from Clemson played more offensive snaps than Tank Bigsby (three) but still didn't record an offensive touch. Shipley has now gone without a carry in four of the Eagles' last six games, indicating he's operating as the team's No. 3 running back. He's expected to continue contributing as one of Philadelphia's top kick returners in the Week 13 matchup against the Bears.
</div>

### 🟢 DeVonta Smith (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Smith led the Eagles in targets and also matched his season high. His longest catch of the day went for 41 yards, which came on an impressive catch deep down the right sideline as he was forced to adjust to an underthrown ball. Smith had a needed bounceback performance after struggling in Week 11, and he now has at least 65 receiving yards in four of his last five games while serving as Philadelphia's most consistent pass catcher.
</div>

### 🟢 Jalen Hurts (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Hurts appeared to be in for a huge fantasy performance, as all three of his touchdowns came in the first 19 minutes of game time. While the offense stalled from there, Hurts logged both his most pass attempts and completions of the season to post his second-highest yardage total of the campaign. That led to an excellent fantasy performance, though it masked his ongoing inconsistency as a passer, as he had topped out at 183 passing yards over his previous three contests. Hurts also continues to rely primarily on touchdowns for his rushing production, racking up fewer than 35 rushing yards in seven straight games.
</div>

### 🟢 DK Metcalf (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Metcalf led the Steelers in targets but had a quiet game with Aaron Rodgers (wrist) sidelined and Mason Rudolph under center. His longest catch of the day went for only eight yards, and his lone deep target was picked off. Metcalf saved his performance with a six-yard touchdown run late in the first quarter-- his first score since Week 8. Metcalf also battled an ankle injury for much of the second and third quarters. While he didn't miss a significant amount of time in the loss, his practice status will be worth monitoring ahead of Pittsburgh's Week 13 matchup against the Bills.
</div>

### 🟢 Christian McCaffrey (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> McCaffrey showed no mercy to the team that drafted him in the first round of the 2017 NFL Draft after finishing Monday Night Football as the star of the game while earning his current club its eighth victory in the process. The dual-threat workhorse accounted for 42 percent of the 49ers' 340 yards of offense in his fifth game garnering 30 or more touches this season. McCaffrey continues to carry fantasy squads with 1,581 combined yards from scrimmage and 12 touchdowns scored in as many starts, showing no ill effects from his injury-plagued 2024 campaign. CMC will face a stiffer test Week 13 against the Browns' vaunted defense, but there is little reason to believe that he won't command as many touches as he can handle Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Rachaad White (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> White maintained a key role in the Buccaneers' backfield with Bucky Irving (shoulder) remaining inactive. He served as the change of pace to Sean Tucker, though White was the more efficient back thanks to lengthy runs of 16 and 12 yards. Irving reportedly has a realistic chance to return in Week 13, leaving White's future role unclear.
</div>

### 🟡 Elic Ayomanor (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
