## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Drake London (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> London returned from a four-game absence due to a knee injury and was held in check by Arizona's defense. The star wideout was averaging 6.7 receptions and 90.0 yards in nine active games prior to going down in Week 11, highlighting the stark drop-off in production in Sunday's return. The good news is that London appeared to get through the contest without suffering a setback, potentially setting up a true return to form in Week 17 against the Rams.
</div>

### 🟢 Justice Hill (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Injured Reserve<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Hill will miss a fourth consecutive game while on injured reserve Sunday against the Patriots, but the change-of-pace running back could be back before the conclusion of the regular season. Keaton Mitchell and Rasheen Ali have mixed in behind Derrick Henry during Hill's absence.
</div>

### 🟢 Joshua Palmer (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Since returning from injury in the Bills' Week 15 win over the Patriots, Palmer has caught two of three targets for just 18 yards. However, he's played the third-most offensive snaps (58) among Buffalo wideouts during that span, trailing Khalil Shakir (72) and Tyrell Shavers (64). Palmer likely won't carry much fantasy value in the Week 17 matchup against the Eagles, despite his role.
</div>

### 🟢 Courtland Sutton (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Sutton was unsurprisingly Bo Nix's favorite target, which allowed him to reach double-digit opportunities for the third straight week. He got involved early in the game, logging long receptions of 17 and 14 yards on Denver's second possession before catching a 15-yard touchdown early in the second quarter. While Sutton was quiet for most of the game thereafter, he has a touchdown or 100 receiving yards in four straight contests.
</div>

### 🟢 Jakobi Meyers (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Parker Washington took over as the Jaguars' top pass catcher in the win, though Meyers still managed eight targets -- his second-highest mark with the team. He failed to record a catch on his first three opportunities, though he managed to make a 25-yard reception just before halftime, setting up a field goal. Meyers continues to have a consistent role in the team's offense, though he's now been held to 50 yards or fewer in four of seven games with the Jaguars.
</div>

### 🟢 Trevor Lawrence (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Even facing one of the toughest matchups in the league, Lawrence continued his very strong stretch of play. He completed six passes of at least 20 yards in addition to touchdown strikes from 12, 10 and three yards away. While he had a modest yardage total on the ground, he chipped in a one-yard rushing score midway through the third quarter to give him five rushing touchdowns in his last eight contests. Overall, Lawrence has at least 240 passing yards in four of his last five games while accounting for multiple scores in all five contests. Though it didn't cost him playing time, Lawrence did have his ankle taped late in the game, which could be worth monitoring throughout the week, per Ryan O'Halloran of The Florida Times-Union.
</div>

### 🟢 Hollywood Brown (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> With Rashee Rice (concussion) and Tyquan Thornton (concussion) inactive against Tennessee, Brown operated as the Chiefs' clear WR2 alongside Xavier Worthy. Unfortunately for Brown, Patrick Mahomes (knee) is out for the remainder of the season, and backup Gardner Minshew suffered a potentially significant knee injury of his own against Tennessee, leaving Chris Oladokun as Kansas City's quarterback by default. It's a lost season for Kansas City, and Brown won't be a recommended fantasy target Thursday against the Broncos.
</div>

### 🟡 Aaron Jones Sr. (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jones exited in the first quarter of Sunday's 16-13 win over the Giants with an ankle injury, but he subsequently returned en route to carrying 21 times for 85 yards and catching two of his three targets for eight yards. His listed limitations Monday are likely maintenance-related, and at this stage there's nothing to suggest that Jones will miss Thursday's game against the Lions. Meanwhile, fellow RB Jordan Mason, who didn't return to Sunday's contest after sustaining an ankle injury, was listed as a non-participant Monday.
</div>

### 🟢 Saquon Barkley (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Barkley topped 100 rushing yards for the third time this season and for the second time in his last three games. He picked up consistent yardage for most of Saturday's matchup, but his performance turned a corner in the fourth quarter. Barkley began his final frame with a 12-yard touchdown run, and he then broke off a 48-yard gain to set up a Philadelphia touchdown two plays later to clinch the victory. His explosive rush was particularly encouraging, as it was only his fourth gain of at least 20 yards on the ground this season.
</div>

### 🟡 George Kittle (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Kittle missed all of the fourth quarter and some of the third due to the ankle issue, and the outcome of the contest wasn't certain until late, so it appears there's at least some chance the star tight end will miss next Sunday's game against Chicago. With that said, further evaluation is needed to determine how serious of an issue Kittle is dealing with, and he will likely do everything he can to play next week given that there is a lot at stake for San Francisco against the Bears. Despite his early exit Monday, Kittle did plenty for fantasy managers who started him, amassing 115 yards and a touchdown on seven catches. Jake Tonges was effective as the 49ers' pass-catching tight end following Kittle's departure and would be a viable fantasy asset in Week 17 if Kittle is forced to sit out.
</div>

### 🟢 Brock Purdy (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Purdy took his game to new heights by throwing five touchdown passes in a game for the first time in his career. The 25-year-old attacked Indianapolis' reeling secondary from the onset, firing three scores to three different receivers on San Francisco's first three possessions Monday. Purdy has been on an absolute heater coming out of the 49ers' bye week, amassing 590 passing yards and eight touchdowns without ever being forced to punt in both starts. The Iowa State Cyclone did lose star TE George Kittle (7-115-1) to an ankle injury in the second half, so Purdy could be missing one of his top weapons against the Bears in Week 17.
</div>

### 🟢 Rashid Shaheed (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Shaheed made the most of his limited touches. His punt return touchdown provided the first six of Seattle's 16 unanswered points in the final 8:03 of regulation, and Shaheed's 31-yard carry came on the team's next offensive play as the Seahawks found a way to get the speedster in space once again. The Seahawks employ a run-first approach on offense and Sam Darnold usually looks Jaxon Smith-Njigba's way when Seattle turns to the air, leaving limited opportunities for supporting players like Shaheed to contribute. That philosophy has led to a 12-3 record, so it's unlikely to change in Week 17 against the Panthers.
</div>

### 🟢 Tony Pollard (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The veteran back continues to roll, topping 100 rushing yards for a third straight game after going the first 12 games of the season without reaching triple digits. Pollard did cede more work to Tyjae Spears, however, as the younger RB saw a season-high 13 carries and 18 touches, turning them into 105 scrimmage yards of his own along with a rushing TD. With the Titans' offense finally looking at least competent, Pollard and Spears could remain in something close to a timeshare over the final two weeks of the season. Pollard is 51 rushing yards shy of his fourth straight 1,000-yard campaign, a milestone he'll look to reach in Week 17 against the Saints.
