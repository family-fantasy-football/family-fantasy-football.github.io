## 🏥 Player Report

### 🔴 Kyler Murray (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Injured Reserve<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> While the Cardinals haven't explicitly indicated Brissett will remain their starting quarterback for the remainder of the season, head coach Jonathan Gannon implied Tuesday that Brissett would have started Week 10 in Seattle even if Murray was fully healthy. The Cardinals then deactivated Murray a day later, and though he'll be eligible to return from IR beginning in Week 14, he looks like he could be ticketed for backup duties so long as Brissett stays healthy and continues to direct a productive offense. With that in mind, Rapoport suggests Murray may have played his last game with Arizona, potentially making the 28-year-old signal-caller a trade or cut candidate during the upcoming offseason. Murray is already fully guaranteed $36.8 million for 2026, and he'll be guaranteed an additional $19.5 million in base salary for 2027 if he remains on the roster through March 16.
</div>

### 🟢 Kyle Pitts Sr. (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The catches and yards were each the second-highest total on the day by a Falcon, as Drake London once again dominated looks from Michael Penix with a 6-104-1 line on eight targets. Pitts has caught multiple passes in every game this season, but he has yet to top 70 receiving yards and has only one touchdown, giving him a decent floor but little ceiling. The tight end will take a 45-420-1 line on 59 targets into a Week 11 meeting with the Panthers.
</div>

### 🟢 Mark Andrews (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Andrews was one of three Baltimore pass catchers to earn at least five targets. He still turned in a limited performance due to being targeted nearly exclusively in short areas of the field, with his longest gain being only six yards. Andrews did manage to find the end zone for his second consecutive game on a two-yard reception, and he now has at least one target in the red zone in three consecutive contests.
</div>

### 🟢 Keon Coleman (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Coleman was far from efficient, but he did finish second in receiving yards and targets behind Khalil Shakir and recorded his third touchdown of the season on a 35-yard catch early in the fourth quarter. Coleman's receiving yardage tally was his highest since Week 1, but his production remains modest overall, and he's posted three catches or less in seven of the last eight games. Coleman next takes aim at the Buccaneers secondary in a Week 11 home matchup.
</div>

### 🟢 Tetairoa McMillan (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The rookie wideout continues to be the most reliable downfield option in an underpowered Panthers passing attack. McMillan has at least three receptions in every game so far this year, putting together a 46-618-2 line on 77 targets in nine contests. He'll look for his first TD since Week 6 in a Week 1 clash with the Falcons.
</div>

### 🟢 Javonte Williams (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Williams ceded just a single rushing opportunity to another running back (Malik Davis) and once again churned out an efficient performance, averaging over 5.0 yards per carry for the fifth time this season. Williams recorded three runs of 10-plus yards along the way, but his fumble at the Cardinals' 37-yard line with just under five minutes remaining and Dallas trying to reduce a 10-point deficit proved costly. The miscue aside, Williams has enjoyed a resurgent first half of his debut Cowboys campaign, and he'll continue in his unquestioned lead-back role in a Week 11 road matchup against the Raiders on Monday night, Nov. 17 following a Week 10 bye.
</div>

### 🟢 Josh Jacobs (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jacobs recorded the Packers' only touchdown of the game on a six-yard run with just under six minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, which marked his 11th score of the season on the ground. The veteran back's trip to the end zone extended his touchdown streak to six games, but he also lost a fumble at his own 44-yard line with only 1:30 remaining, significantly hampering the chances of a comeback. Jacobs has yet to crack the 100-yard threshold in any contest this season, but a Week 11 road matchup against the Giants on Sunday presents a very good opportunity to put an end to that unfavorable trend.
</div>

### 🟢 Nick Chubb (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Rookie Woody Marks led the Texans' backfield with 16 touches to Chubb's six, but the veteran was still productive on his limited volume. It was the third time this season Chubb has failed to get double-digit carries, as he continues to fall behind Marks in the pecking order. Both backs could pop for big numbers, no matter how the workload is split, in Week 11 against the Titans.
</div>

### 🟢 Davis Mills (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Making his first start of the season with C.J. Stroud (concussion) unavailable, Mills struggled through three quarters before coming to life in the fourth, hitting Jayden Higgins and Dalton Schultz for TDs before running in a 14-yard score of his own to complete a stunning comeback from a 29-10 deficit. Mills could return to the bench in Week 11 against the Titans if Stroud gets cleared to return, but if he gets a second start he likely won't need to be quite as busy.
</div>

### 🟢 Quentin Johnston (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Johnston paced the Chargers in targets on Sunday Night Football, finishing with his second game recording double-digit targets this season. The large volume didn't result in a notable fantasy score this time around, as it was Ladd McConkey (4-107-1) who cashed in Justin Herbert's lone touchdown pass of the evening. Johnston is still on pace for a career year with a 37-502-6 receiving line through nine appearances. The 23-year-old will look to enter Los Angeles' Week 12 bye on a high note with a strong showing against the Jaguars next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Malik Washington (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Washington filled his usual jack-of-all-trades role and managed to make an impact as a receiver with a nine-yard touchdown reception to open the scoring. The versatile second-year pro has scored both of his TDs in the last three games, and he now has multiple receptions in eight straight contests but has yet to top 48 receiving yards in any outing this season. Washington will remain in his versatile role during a Week 11 matchup against the Commanders in Madrid next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Justin Jefferson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Opportunity wasn't an issue for Jefferson, as he commanded a season-high 12 targets to lead the team. However, he couldn't get on the same page with J.J. McCarthy -- the Ravens had two interceptions when Jeefferson was targeted -- and his four receptions marked his fewest since Week 2. The duo was particularly poor on deep targets, as all of Jefferson's targets came in the short area of the field, with his longest gain going for just 11 yards. He has now been held below 50 receiving yards in three of McCarthy's four starts this season.
</div>

### 🟢 Theo Johnson (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Johnson set career highs in targets, catches and receiving yards. He has built nice chemistry with rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart, but Dart exited in the second half due to a concussion. It may be more difficult for Johnson to build on this strong outing if he's catching passes from backup quarterback Russell Wilson in Week 11 against the Packers.
</div>

### 🟢 Justin Fields (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Glenn waited until the last moment to name Fields the starter for Sunday's 27-20 win over the Browns despite having had a Week 9 bye to prepare, and per Al Iannazzone of Newsday, the head coach said he wouldn't "waste [his] time" answering questions about the quarterback situation entering Thursday's divisional contest. Fantasy managers in need of a Week 11 starter may need to roster both Fields and Taylor -- or, better yet, avoid the situation entirely -- until an official decision is announced. Fields struggled again despite eking out a win versus Cleveland, completing just six of 11 passes for 54 yards, one touchdown and one interception, with most of his passing yards coming on a 42-yard touchdown to Breece Hall on a screen pass. Part of Fields' issues can be attributed to Garrett Wilson (knee) having been forced out before securing a single catch, but with the No. 1 wideout now seemingly trending in the wrong direction for Week 11, it will be difficult to trust any part of New York's passing game regardless of who lines up under center.
</div>

### 🟢 Mac Jones (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jones made another start under center for the injured Brock Purdy (toe), and the results were positive from a fantasy perspective. It was Jones' third spot-start in which he threw for more than 300 yards, and the second in which he recorded three touchdown passes. After the loss, head coach Kyle Shanahan hinted that Purdy could be ready to return in Week 11, which would put an end to Jones' run as a startable option in fantasy. Managers should hold until an official announcement is made ahead of next Sunday's tilt against the Cardinals, as Jones has been exceeding expectations as the 49ers' starter.
</div>

### 🔴 Chris Godwin Jr. (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Doubtful<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Godwin has yet to return to practice and has missed four straight games. He's looking at missing a fifth consecutive contest versus Buffalo. With Mike Evans (collarbone) also shelved, the Bucs will continue to roll with Emeka Egbuka, Tez Johnson and Sterling Shepard at wide receiver versus Buffalo.
