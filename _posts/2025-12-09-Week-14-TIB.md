## 🏥 Player Report

### 🔴 Kyler Murray (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Injured Reserve<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Many have speculated that this might be Murray's fate, given that he wasn't initially expected to have a lengthy absence and then ended up on IR. The Cardinals will have an interesting offseason discussion, to say the least. Will they use a potential top-10 pick on a quarterback, shop for another veteran, or even bring back Jacoby Brissett? Meanwhile, Brissett will remain the starter the rest of this season.
</div>

### 🟡 Kyle Pitts Sr. (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Pitts recorded a 92 percent snap share in Sunday's 37-9 loss to the Seahawks, a game in which the tight end caught six of his 10 targets for a team-high 90 yards. Chances are, Pitts' listed limitations Monday were maintenance-related, with added context on that front set to arrive via Tuesday's injury report.
</div>

### 🟢 Darnell Mooney (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Even with Drake London (knee) out of action again, Mooney couldn't get anything going against Seattle's tough defense, as tight end Kyle Pitts wound up leading Atlanta in all receiving categories. In the three games London has missed, Mooney's managed just a 6-105-1 line on 12 targets, making him little more than a dart throw for fantasy purposes in Week 15 against the Buccaneers, whether London is healthy or not.
</div>

### 🟢 Mark Andrews (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Fresh off a three-year extension, Andrews finished third on the team in targets behind Zay Flowers and Isaiah Likely. However, he was unable to turn that into much production and was held under 10 yards for the second time in the last three weeks. Andrews should bounce back thanks to his involvement in the Baltimore offense, though Isaiah Likely has been the more productive tight end on the roster in the last two contests.
</div>

### 🟢 Keon Coleman (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> On a snowy Sunday, Josh Allen completed passes to nine different teammates, with much of his production going to tight ends Dawson Knox (6-93-0) and Dalton Kincaid (4-41-1). None of Buffalo's wide receivers had more than two catches or 21 yards, though Khalil Shakir did manage a TD reception. Coleman was a healthy scratch for both Week 11 and Week 12 due to disciplinary measures, and in two games since returning to action, he's tallied four catches on six targets for 25 yards and a touchdown.
</div>

### 🟢 Tetairoa McMillan (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> While the rookie wideout was held in check for three quarters, McMillan finally got free on a fourth-down play in the fourth and hauled in a touchdown from Bryce Young for the go-ahead score. McMillan has gotten into the end zone in three straight games, producing an 11-208-4 line on 21 targets as he establishes himself as Young's go-to option in clutch situations. McMillan will get some rest during next week's bye before taking aim at the Saints in Week 15.
</div>

### 🟢 Javonte Williams (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Williams put together a workmanlike effort that included his ninth rushing touchdown of the campaign on a one-yard run early in the third quarter. The veteran back eclipsed the 60-yard mark on the ground for the fourth time in the last five games, although he averaged under 4.0 yards per carry for the second straight contest. Williams also crossed the 1,000-yard mark for the season with Thursday's production, and he'll look to exploit a vulnerable Vikings run defense in a Week 15 Sunday night home matchup on Dec. 14.
</div>

### 🟢 Josh Jacobs (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jacobs was limited early in the practice week with the same knee injury he picked up in Week 12 before being cleared of the designation with a full practice Friday. The 27-year-old showed no limitations while handling 20 out of 23 backfield carries in the win over Chicago. Jacobs' touchdown run in the fourth quarter was the talented runner's 12th trip to the end zone on the season and first since Week 10. With his health back in order, Jacobs is shaping up to be an RB1 for fantasy managers as the playoff schedule approaches.
</div>

### 🟡 Nick Chubb (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 Quentin Johnston (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Los Angeles couldn't get anything going through the air as almost half of the team's total passing yards (139) came on a two-yard checkdown to second-year running back Kimani Vidal who burst ahead for a 60-yard completion. That's a credit to the fearsome Philadelphia pass rush who created pressure on over half of Justin Herbert's dropbacks. None of that really helps fantasy managers dependent on Johnston, however, and it's entirely possible similar issues present themselves against a difficult Kansas City defense in Arrowhead come Week 15.
</div>

### 🟢 Malik Washington (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Washington finished second on the team in targets behind only Jaylen Waddle (3-50-1 on seven targets), though Tua Tagovailoa looked the way of Darren Waller, Greg Dulcich, and Jaylen Wright three times each, and the early departure of De'Von Achane (ribs) knocked out one of the Dolphins' usual top contributors in the passing game. Though Washington has established a fair floor with at least three catches in eight of his last nine appearances, he's yet to surpass 50 receiving yards this season and lacks a demonstrable ceiling heading into Miami's matchup against the Steelers on Monday Night Football in Week 15.
</div>

### 🟢 Justin Jefferson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> For the second straight game, Jefferson failed to reach 20 receiving yards, but this time he didn't have an undrafted rookie under center as an excuse. J.J. McCarthy returned from a concussion in Week 14 and threw a career-high three TDs, but all three went to tight ends, while Jordan Addison was his top option with a 4-62-0 line on seven targets. Jefferson hasn't scored a touchdown himself since Week 9 and hasn't had a 100-yard performance since Week 5, but he gets another golden opportunity to break out in Week 15 against the Cowboys.
</div>

### 🟢 Theo Johnson (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Johnson matched his previous single-game high in targets (eight) set back in Week 10 against the Bears, but the large volume didn't translate into proportional production this time around. The 24-year-old was New York's fourth-leading receiver despite tying Wan'Dale Robinson for the most looks from Jaxson Dart on Monday Night Football. Johnson has still been a pleasant surprise in fantasy this season by generating a 42-456-5 receiving line across 13 games while catching passes from three different quarterbacks. The Penn State product has carved out a significant role on offense and should maintain steady value when the Giants return from the upcoming bye week to host the Commanders in Week 15.
</div>

### 🟡 Justin Fields (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 Aaron Rodgers (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Rodgers entered the game with one of the lowest average intended air yards in the league, but he took plenty of downfield shots in Sunday's divisional matchup. He was particularly effective targeting DK Metcalf, as the duo connected for long gains of 52 and 41 yards. Rodgers also accounted for multiple scores for the first time since Week 8, beginning with a one-yard touchdown scamper and later on a 38-yard pass -- most of which came after the catch -- to Jaylen Warren. It's difficult to trust the Steelers' passing offense moving forward, but Rodgers could keep the momentum going with a favorable Week 15 matchup against Miami.
</div>

### 🟡 Chris Godwin Jr. (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Godwin continues to manage a fibula issue, but with no reported setbacks in Sunday's 24-20 loss to the Saints, the wideout's listed limitations Monday were presumably maintenance-related. Added context regarding Godwin's status for Thursday night's game against the Falcons will arrive Tuesday, but at this stage there's no reason to believe that his Week 15 availability is in danger.
</div>

### 🟢 Marcus Mariota (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jayden Daniels returned to action in Week 14 but didn't last long, appearing to aggravate an injury to his left elbow in the third quarter and quickly being ruled out for the rest of the contest. Mariota took over the offense the rest of the way but had no more success against the Minnesota defense than Daniels did. There's no indication yet on Daniels' status for a Week 15 tilt against the Giants, but with the Commanders at 3-10 and playing for nothing but draft slotting, it's certainly possible the organization will decide to protect its franchise QB from any further damage and hand the reins to Mariota for the remainder of the season.
