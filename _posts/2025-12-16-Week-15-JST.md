## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Emari Demercado (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Demercado thus is in line for his first game action since he initially suffered a high-ankle sprain during Week 11 at San Francisco. He'll join healthy backfield mates Bam Knight and Michael Carter in Week 15. In the four games in which all three have received offensive snaps this season, Demercado has totaled 18 touches to Knight's 37 and Carter's 44, which would seem to indicate Demercado will be third in the pecking order for reps, especially given that he didn't log a full practice in advance of his return.
</div>

### 🟡 Rome Odunze (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Johnson indicated that Chicago could consider shutting Odunze down for the time being in order for him to rest up in time for the playoffs, saying it may be necessary "to protect him from himself a little bit so he can help us down the road." Odunze had appeared primed to retake the field Week 15 against Cleveland, but he was made a late scratch after aggravating the stress fracture in his foot during pregame warmups. With Luther Burden (ankle) now considered day-to-day ahead of Saturday's divisional matchup against the Packers, it's possible Olamide Zaccheaus and Devin Duvernay could be tasked with expanded roles in the receiving game behind DJ Moore and tight ends Colston Loveland and Cole Kmet.
</div>

### 🟢 Caleb Williams (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Williams had one of the more efficient showings of his career, averaging a solid 8.6 yards per attempt while also completing four passes of at least 20 yards. The highlight of his performance came on a 22-yard touchdown connection with DJ Moore, when Williams split two defenders on a throw to the corner of the end zone while fading away on a rollout midway through the third quarter. The only thing slowing Williams down was game script, as he attempted only 10 passes in the second half with the Bears up by three scores for most of that span. He now has multiple touchdowns in three of his last four games, with this marking his highest yardage total since Week 9.
</div>

### 🟢 D'Andre Swift (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Swift split carries with Kyle Monangai through the first half, but the Bears relied upon him heavily to close out the game. He enjoyed a big second half as a result, picking up 56 yards on nine carries, highlighted by a 17-yard score late in the third quarter. Swift also punched in a score midway through the first quarter, giving him his first multi-touchdown performance of the season. He's now recorded at least 80 yards from scrimmage in five of his last six games.
</div>

### 🔴 Jayden Reed (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Reed tied for the team lead with six targets, though the Packers continued to spread opportunity evenly among several of their skill-position players. He was one of three receivers to top 50 receiving yards, with most of his production coming after the catch -- including a 29-yard gain midway through the second quarter to help set up a Green Bay touchdown. Reed has combined to see 10 targets in two games since returning from a collarbone injury, and he should remain a key playmaker in the Packers' offense down the stretch of the regular season.
</div>

### 🟢 Travis Kelce (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Kelce paced the Chiefs in receiving yards while tying Rashee Rice for the team lead in receptions as well during a loss that officially eliminated Kansas City from playoff contention. The perennial Pro Bowler was the intended receiver on Gardner Minshew's game-ending interception, with the veteran backup quarterback in the game due to Patrick Mahomes having suffered a potentially serious knee injury on the first play after the two-minute warning. Kelce should remain a key part of the offense for the final three games, although how much run head coach Andy Reid will give a veteran player such as the talented tight end remains to be seen, particularly if Mahomes is sidelined the rest of the way.
</div>

### 🟢 Hunter Henry (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Drake Maye completed just 14 of 23 passes during Sunday's loss, and Henry's three targets from the second-year quarterback were his lowest since Week 8 against the Browns (one target). Even with the low number of looks, Henry still finished in a three-way tie for the third-most targets on the Patriots behind Mack Hollins (eight) and Stefon Diggs (four). Henry is up to 46 catches (on 72 targets) for 628 yards and five touchdowns through 14 regular-season games, and he's close to surpassing his career high in receiving yards that he set in 2024 (674 yards over 16 regular-season games). His next opportunity to surpass that career-high mark is Week 16 against the Ravens on Sunday, Dec. 21.
</div>

### 🟢 Chris Olave (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Olave recorded a 12-yard touchdown reception with 2:29 remaining in the fourth quarter. The ensuing PAT tied the game, and Saints kicker Charlie Smyth tacked on the game-winning 47-yard field goal with two seconds left. Working as New Orleans' clear No. 1 wide receiver, Olave has reached 50 receiving yards or scored a touchdown in all but one game this season. He'll likely maintain a prominent role in Week 16 against the subpar Jets secondary.
</div>

### 🟢 Will Shipley (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Eagles went up by 31 pointson the first play of the fourth quarter, a situation which usually leads to some garbage time touches for running backs lower on the depth chart. In this case, those all went to Tank Bigsby, who had 27 offensive snaps to Shipley's three and 17 carries to Shipley's zero.
</div>

### 🟢 DeVonta Smith (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The highlight of Smith's otherwise quiet afternoon was a 44-yard reception in the first half, which helped the speedster finish second in receiving yards to Dallas Goedert. The Eagles' offense didn't need to do much against an overmatched Raiders squad, so Smith's relatively modest afternoon should be viewed in that context. Smith figures to be busier in a Week 16 road matchup against the vulnerable Commanders defense on Saturday afternoon.
</div>

### 🟢 Jalen Hurts (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Coming off a forgettable five-turnover showing against the Chargers in a Week 14 overtime loss, Hurts was near perfect against a considerably inferior opponent. The reigning Super Bowl MVP threw two short shovel-pass TDs to Dallas Goedert before connecting with A.J. Brown from 27 yards out on the first play of the fourth quarter to close out the scoring on the afternoon. Hurts now has multiple TD tosses in two of the last three games after a three-game stretch with one or zero scoring passes, and he lines up for another potentially productive day in a Week 16 road matchup against the Commanders on Saturday afternoon.
</div>

### 🟢 DK Metcalf (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Metcalf managed to finish as the Steelers' leading receiver despite registering his lowest target count to date in 2025. The physical wideout squeezed all the juice out of his limited opportunities by scoring his sixth touchdown of the season on his third and final reception of the evening. After being held to a 18-144-0 receiving line in Weeks 9-13, Metcalf has quickly racked up a 203 yards over his last two starts. A favorable matchup against the Lions' depleted secondary is on tap for Metcalf and Pittsburgh in Week 16.
</div>

### 🟢 Christian McCaffrey (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> McCaffrey battled an illness and a minor back injury in order to suit up for Sunday's contest, and he looked no worse for wear in the win. The 29-year-old punched in his ninth rushing touchdown of the campaign while extending his scoring streak to four games. CMC was used sporadically as a receiver (one target) for the first time this season after entering the contest with averages of 6.5 receptions on 8.2 targets. Assuming his back injury didn't flare up Sunday, fantasy managers can expect McCaffrey to spearhead San Francisco's offense on the road against Indianapolis on Monday Night Football in Week 16.
</div>

### 🟢 Rachaad White (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> White surprisingly was limited to his lowest touch count of the season, just four days after gaining an efficient 53 yards on 11 carries against the Saints. The veteran back was even out-touched by Sean Tucker, who logged three more carries and recorded a rushing touchdown. The usage behind Bucky Irving has been a bit haphazard over a limited sample this season, so White could revert to a more typical workload in a Week 16 road matchup against the Panthers on Sunday, Dec. 21.
</div>

### 🟢 Elic Ayomanor (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Ayomanor recorded a 17-yard catch on Tennessee's opening possession and looked to be in for a big role in the offense. However, he wasn't targeted again and has now been held to only one catch in three straight contests.
</div>
