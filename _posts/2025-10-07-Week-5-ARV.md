## Player Report

#### Bijan Robinson (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The 181 scrimmage yards were a career high for Robinson, as he hit the century mark in receiving yards for the second time in four games to begin the season. The third-year RB scored on a 14-yard run in the second quarter, his first TD on the ground in 2025, and he's topped 100 combined yards in every game so far. Robinson has amassed 314 rushing yards and 274 receiving yards through four weeks, earning a well-deserved rest during Atlanta's Week 5 bye before facing the Bills in Week 6.
#### Xavier Legette (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Making his return from a two-game absence due to a hamstring injury, Legette made an impact with a seven-yard scoring grab late in the second quarter that ignited a comeback from a 17-0 deficit. Despite the score, the 2024 first-round pick continues to struggle to generate anything resembling useful fantasy production, as he now has a 6-39-1 line on 18 targets through his three games. Bryce Young's struggles with consistency and accuracy are partly to blame, but Legette isn't the most inspiring fantasy prospect despite a favorable Week 6 home matchup against the Cowboys next Sunday afternoon.
#### Colston Loveland (TE)
**Injury Status:** Out <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** out
#### Dylan Sampson (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Not much changed for Sampson with the switch from quarterback Joe Flacco to Dillon Gabriel. Sampson's seven snaps Sunday was the third consecutive game with fewer than 10 for the rookie, whose role has diminished since Quinshon Judkins entered the picture Week 2.
#### Jaydon Blue (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** With Miles Sanders (ankle) and KaVontae Turpin (foot) both sidelined, Blue drew into the game-day lineup for the first time but didn't see much usage. It would likely take an injury to Cowboys lead back Javonte Williams for Blue to get onto the fantasy radar.
#### Bo Nix (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Nix had his fair share of struggles against the Eagles' talented defense, but he helped lead Denver back from a 17-3 second-half deficit. Nix led a trio of fourth-quarter scoring drives, capping one of them with an 11-yard touchdown pass to Evan Engram and following it up with a two-point conversion toss to Troy Franklin. Nix has at least one touchdown pass in every game thus far this season and has posted his two highest passing yardage totals of the campaign in the last pair of contests heading into a Week 6 trip across the pond to face the Jets in London.
#### Kalif Raymond (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Raymond remained on the turf for some time after taking a hit on an 11-yard punt return in second quarter before walking off the field under his own power. His only contribution to Sunday's box score was the aforementioned return, as he had no targets at the time of his exit.
#### Geno Smith (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** The left half of Smith's stat line looked perfectly acceptable, but the two picks, four sacks and quarterback rating of 18.9 that comprise the rest of his numbers all underscore how difficult the afternoon was. The Raiders' day actually started off in encouraging fashion via a marathon 16-play, 80-yard drive that consumed 9:50 of the first quarter, but that ultimately culminated in a field goal. The next five possessions would feature a blocked punt, both of Smith's interceptions, a punt and a missed field goal, helping dig Las Vegas into a hole it couldn't recover from. Smith has now thrown nine interceptions over his first five games at the helm of the Raiders' offense, including three contests in which he's tossed multiple picks. Nevertheless, Smith will continue under center, potentially without Brock Bowers (knee) once again, when the Raiders welcome in the Titans for a favorable Week 6 home clash.
#### Kyren Williams (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Williams averaged an impressive 4.6 yards per carry with a long gain of 20 yards, but it was via his work as a receiver that he made the biggest impact by far. His reception, receiving yardage and target totals were all season highs, and he added his second and third receiving touchdowns of the campaign on 14- and eight-yard grabs in the second and fourth quarters, respectively. However, the star running back's night ended on quite the sour note, as he was stuffed on a fourth-and-1 play that ended the game. Williams notably logged 13 more carries than backfield mate Blake Corum in Thursday's loss, a reminder that the former is still the clear leader of the ground attack heading into a Week 6 road matchup against the Ravens on Sunday, Oct. 12.
#### Puka Nacua (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Nacua was in the customary position of leading the Rams in receptions and targets while checking in second in receiving yards. The prolific pass catcher also brought in one of Matthew Stafford's three touchdown passes, recording a one-yard scoring grab with just under four minutes remaining in the third quarter. Nacua now has three consecutive double-digit reception and target totals, and he's posted both of his touchdowns this season in the last pair of contests. Nacua will remain Stafford's most reliable target in a Week 6 road matchup against the Ravens on Sunday, Oct. 12.
#### Tyreek Hill (WR)
**Injury Status:** Injured Reserve <br>
**Lineup Slot:** IR <br>
**Details:** Per Marcel Louis-Jacques of ESPN,   Hill -- who underwent a major procedure Tuesday to repair his dislocated left knee and multiple torn ligaments, including his ACL -- won't need additional surgery, with agent Drew Rosenhaus indicating afterward that the wideout will play next season, while noting that "the realistic goal is the start of the season." In Hill's absence for the rest of the 2025 campaign, Malik Washington and Nick Westbrook-Ikhine are in line to see expanded roles alongside top WR Jaylen Waddle, with Dee Eskridge, Cedrick Wilson and Tahj Washington available to mix in.
#### Cade Otton (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Otton set new season highs in targets, receptions and yardage. The veteran starter produced next to nothing over his previous four appearances, literally saddling managers with bagels in the box score for Weeks 1 and 3. The 26-year-old is averaging 4.5 targets in the two games Mike Evans (hamstring) has missed, highlighting a window of elevated usage for the tight end while the team's star wideout is sidelined. Otton's strong results immediately put him back on the map at a shallow fantasy position for next Sunday's tilt against the 49ers.
#### Emeka Egbuka (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Egbuka was unconscious in Sunday's thrilling victory, catching every ball thrown his way en route to a new career high in receiving yards (163). The standout rookie continued to step up in the absence of Mike Evans (hamstring), who missed his second game recovering from a Week 3 injury. Egbuka produced his second consecutive game with 100-plus yards and a trip to the end zone, proving that he can adequately fill his superstar teammate's shoes as Tampa Bay's No. 1 wideout. The Ohio State product is also proving that he can produce WR1 numbers for fantasy managers heading into a matchup against the 49ers next Sunday.
#### Calvin Ridley (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Ridley entered Sunday's game having recorded only 141 yards combined across his first four games of the season. He finally got on track against the Cardinals, accounting for the Titans' three longest plays from scrimmage with receptions of 47, 38 and 25 yards. His longest two came at particularly opportune times, as he helped set up a touchdown early in the fourth quarter before getting Tennessee into field-goal range to attempt the game-winning kick as time expired. It will still be difficult to consistently trust Ridley given his start to the season, but it was encouraging to see him display some rapport with Cam Ward.
#### Deebo Samuel (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Samuel overcame a heel injury during the practice week to lead a shorthanded Washington receiver room Sunday. The star acquisition led his new club in targets, receptions and receiving yards while catching QB Jayden Daniels' only passing touchdown of the contest. The 29-year-old has turned back the clock in 2025, generating 346 yards of offense and four total touchdowns through five games. Even if No. 1 wideout Terry McLaurin (quadriceps) returns against the Bears next Monday, Samuel's consistent production makes him a must-start asset in fantasy for Week 6.
