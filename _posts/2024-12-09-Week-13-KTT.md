## Player Report

#### Drake London (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Details:** London had a solid but relatively unspectacular afternoon despite Kirk Cousins' 344-yard tally, finishing third in receiving yards behind Darnell Mooney and the surging Ray-Ray McCloud. The third-year wideout did finish second in targets, and he's now reached at least 70 receiving yards in three of the past four games while notching double-digit targets in each of those contests. London next takes aim at a vulnerable Raiders defense in a Week 15 road matchup on Monday night, Dec. 16.
#### Kyle Pitts (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Details:** Pitts was held without a catch for the second time this season, and over the last four games, he has totaled six receptions on 12 targets for 75 yards. From Weeks 5 to 8, the tight end caught 21 of 27 targets for 314 yards and two touchdowns. However, that stretch is starting to look like an outlier compared to the rest of his season -- 14 catches on 27 targets for 180 yards and a TD across his other eight appearances. It's worth noting Kirk Cousins had his worst game of the season against the Chargers, throwing four interceptions and zero touchdowns, so a bounce-back effort from the veteran QB could mean better production from Pitts moving forward.
#### Josh Allen (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Details:** Allen had a prolific performance in the loss, accounting for all six of Buffalo's touchdowns on the day -- a pair of which came on 51- and 41-yard touchdown throws. He also completed a total of six passes that went for more than 20 yards, leading to his highest yardage total of the campaign and his second performance of more than 300 yards. Allen supplemented his work through the air by getting more aggressive with his legs, as his 82 yards on the ground were a season high. He also has at least one rushing score in four straight contests. All told, Allen became the first  NFL player to account for three passing and three rushing touchdowns in a regular-season game in NFL history, per NFL.com.
#### Trey Sermon (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Details:** Sermon continues to see little opportunity in a backfield dominated by Jonathan Taylor. The Ohio State product hasn't had a carry since Week 9, or a target in either of the team's last two contests. However, he was involved in the return game and had a 23-yard kick return Sunday. Indianapolis has a Week 14 bye, but Sermon will be back on the field in Week 15 against Denver and likely continue seeing limited opportunities unless Taylor suffers an injury.
#### Jonathan Taylor (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Details:** The veteran RB just missed compiling 100 rushing yards for the fifth time in 10 appearances this season, and Taylor ended his four-game scoring drought with his first TD reception of the year late in the first quarter. Taylor heads into the Colts' Week 14 bye only 78 yards short of 1,000 scrimmage yards, a mark he reached in each of his first three NFL seasons before falling short in an injury-plagued 2023.
#### DeAndre Hopkins (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Details:** Hopkins scored a nine-yard touchdown in the second quarter and got both hands on a deep ball just outside the end zone early in the fourth before having it knocked out by a jarring hit for an incomplete pass. He accounted for Kansas City's only touchdown of the game but finished third on the team in receiving yards behind Travis Kelce (45) and Xavier Worthy (41) despite pacing the team in targets. Hopkins has established himself as the No. 1 wide receiver in Kansas City heading into a Week 15 matchup with the Browns, notching nine targets in three of his last six games while scoring four touchdowns over that span.
#### Zamir White (RB)
**Injury Status:** Out <br>
**Details:** out
#### Jakobi Meyers (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Details:** Despite the disappointing team outcome and Aidan O'Connell's exit in the second half due to a knee injury, the ever-reliable Meyers turned in another productive effort that included a co-team-high reception total. The veteran wideout also set the pace in targets and finished just a yard short of drawing even with Michael Mayer for the team lead in receiving yards. Meyers has at least six catches in five of the last six contests heading into a Week 15 Monday night home matchup against the Falcons on Dec. 16.
#### T.J. Hockenson (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Details:** The veteran tight end was quiet throughout most of the afternoon, but he opened the second half with catches of 10 and 18 yards on the Vikings' first possession of the third quarter. Hockenson's reception total was the third highest of his injury-delayed season, as was his yardage tally. Hockenson and the Vikings next welcome in the Bears for a Week 15 home matchup on Monday night, Dec. 16.
#### Davante Adams (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Details:** After a quiet start, Adams came alive with four catches for 54 yards -- including a 34-yard reception -- on the Jets' final drive of the first half, which resulted in a go-ahead field goal. Adams kept rolling to begin the second half, catching a three-yard touchdown pass to restore the lead. Miami ultimately came back to tie the game in the final seconds of regulation and won it in overtime without giving the Jets a chance to possess the ball, but Adams still managed to post his highest yardage total as a member of the Jets. Adams has notched at least 11 targets in four of his past five games, so he's likely to play a significant role once again in Week 15 against a weak Jacksonville pass defense.
#### George Pickens (WR)
**Injury Status:** Out <br>
**Details:** Pickens popped up on Pittsburgh's injury report late in Week 14, after he was limited in Friday's practice. The final decision to hold him out versus Cleveland reportedly wasn't made until late Sunday morning, an indication that the Steelers had some hope the standout wide receiver could play through his hamstring issue. A Grade 2 strain, though, could tentatively also impede Pickens' availability Week 15 on the road against Philadelphia, if not for a longer stretch. As long as Pickens can't go, Van Jefferson, Calvin Austin, Mike Williams, Ben Skowronek and Scotty Miller, as well as tight end Pat Freiermuth, will be called upon to handle expanded opportunities in the receiving game.
#### Bucky Irving (RB)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Details:** Bowles said Irving's availability Week 15 against the Chargers will depend on whether his back loosens up in time for the road matchup. In the event that Irving isn't able to get right in time to suit up in Los Angeles, Rachaad White will be positioned to lead Tampa Bay's backfield, with Sean Tucker handling the No. 2 role.
#### Sterling Shepard (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Details:** The veteran wideout tied Cade Otton for the second-most targets on the Bucs while also checking in as the runner-up to Mike Evans in receiving yards. Shepard has carved out a decent complementary niche in the Buccaneers' air attack, recording at least three catches and five targets in four of the last five games while eclipsing 40 receiving yards twice in that span. Shepard should continue drawing his fair share of one-time college teammate Baker Mayfield's attention in a Week 14 home matchup against the Raiders.
#### Will Levis (QB)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Details:** Levis drew one of the best matchups in the league against a struggling Jaguars defense, but he managed to do little with the opportunity. Tennessee didn't find the end zone on the day, while Levis averaged only 5.3 yards per attempt. Most concerning was that he aggravated the AC joint sprain that cost him three games earlier in the season on a hard hit on the final play of the first half, per Turron Davenport of ESPN.com. That likely affected his performance in the final two quarters of the loss and casts doubt on his status moving forward.
#### Zach Ertz (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Details:** Ertz extended Washington's lead to 35-13 with a four-yard touchdown catch in the fourth quarter. He has scored in three consecutive games after recording only one touchdown through 10 games with the Commanders. Ertz will look to extend his touchdown streak in Week 15 against the Saints after a Week 14 bye.
#### Brian Robinson Jr. (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Details:** Robinson quickly showed that he's over the ankle injury he sustained in the Week 12 loss to Dallas, opening the scoring with a 40-yard touchdown run on the game's first possession. That hot start helped Robinson post his third 100-yard rushing performance of the season and first since Week 4. With Austin Ekeler (concussion) on IR, Robinson should continue to handle heavy workloads as the clear lead back after Washington's Week 14 bye.
