## Player Report

#### D'Andre Swift (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Swift created a conundrum for fantasy managers when he was deemed questionable with a groin injury for one of the last two games of Week 15. The 25-year-old performed well on 20 touches given the negative game script, and the 19 carries ranked second for the tailback in 14 starts this season. Swift did fail to punch in a short touchdown early in the second half, forcing the Bears to settle for a field goal in the eventual loss. Now that he's healthy, the Georgia product will prepare to face the team (the Lions) that drafted him in 2020 on Sunday.
#### Joe Burrow (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Burrow's second pass of the game was picked off, but he bounced back with a six-yard touchdown pass to Chase Brown on Cincinnati's second drive. The star quarterback turned it over again on the following possession by losing a red-zone fumble before responding with another game-tying touchdown pass, this time to defensive end Sam Hubbard from two yards out. Burrow finally gave the Bengals their first lead with his third touchdown pass of the first half, finding Tee Higgins for a 38-yard score. Cincinnati ran only six offensive plays in the third quarter, the last of which was Burrow's second interception and third turnover of the afternoon. The Bengals forced six turnovers themselves, so the offense continued to throttle down in the fourth, which kept Burrow 29 yards short of a fifth consecutive 300-yard performance. Burrow will look to add to his league-leading 36 touchdown passes in Week 16 against a Browns defense that held him to 181 passing yards back in Week 7.
#### Devaughn Vele (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Vele's Week 13 performance was a major disappointment considering rookie quarterback Bo Nix threw for 294 yards against the Browns. Operating as the No. 2 wideout, Vele played 31 of the Broncos' 66 offensive snaps Monday, second only to Courtland Sutton's 62. The rookie will look to bounce back against the Colts on Dec. 15 when the Broncos return from their Week 14 bye.
#### Jameson Williams (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Williams was limited to his lowest reception total since Week 10, but he did salvage his day with a three-yard touchdown catch with less than a minute left in the game. The wide receiver has now compiled 25 catches for 386 yards and two touchdowns over the last six games following his two-game suspension. Williams has emerged as a legitimate No. 2 option at wide receiver behind Amon-Ra St. Brown this season, catching 42 of 68 targets for 747 yards and five touchdowns while adding eight carries for 56 yards over 12 games.
#### Joe Mixon (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** The injury occurred during the second quarter, but Mixon was able to finish the game, although his 32 snaps were the fewest since he returned from an earlier ankle injury Week 6. The Texans feel Miami's Jordyn Brooks should have been flagged for an illegal hip-drop tackle, which is similar to the one that resulted in Mixon getting injured in Week 2 against the Bears. Officials did not flag the defender for a penalty on either play; however, Chicago's T.J. Edwards was fined for the tackle under a new NFL rule outlawing a tackling technique that has caused a high frequency of injuries. Mixon's status should be monitored during the preparation week leading into Saturday's game at Kansas City.
#### Ameer Abdullah (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Starter Sincere McCormick (ankle) was injured in the second quarter before being ruled out at halftime, opening extra playing time for the Raiders' backup RBs. Abdullah took full advantage of the opportunity and cashed in a late touchdown reception while Alexander Mattison (7-24-0) handled the early-down work in the second half. Despite the disparity in production Monday, Mattison figures to handle starting duties should McCormick be ruled out for a Week 16 tilt against the Jaguars. Abdullah would likely get worked in as a receiving option like we saw against the Falcons in the aforementioned scenario.
#### Ladd McConkey (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** McConkey was iffy leading up to Sunday's kickoff after missing last week's contest due to injury. Hopefully fantasy managers were able to activate the shifty receiver for Week 15 after he led the Chargers in receiving yards while cashing in one of Justin Herbert's two passing touchdowns in the blowout loss. Don't be surprised if the rookie wideout is limited on a short practice week despite completing Sunday's tilt without issue after logging only limited practices leading up to the contest against Tampa Bay. Assuming he suits up in Week 16, McConkey makes for a fine fantasy play against the Broncos on Thursday Night Football.
#### Demarcus Robinson (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** It was a miserable night for the Rams' pass catchers outside of Puka Nacua (7-97-0), as the rest of the team combined for just nine catches for 63 yards. Robinson's second straight goose egg for fantasy managers can be partially attributed to the rainy weather in San Francisco, but the shoulder injury that limited him to just a single practice prior to Thursday's contest didn't hinder his playing time; he was second on the team behind Cooper Kupp with 51 offensive snaps. Things don't get any easier for Robinson next week, as a formidable Jets pass defense is up next in Week 16.
#### Matthew Stafford (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Stafford didn't look anywhere near as sharp as he had just four days earlier in a track meet against Josh Allen and the Bills, but wet conditions throughout the night certainly played a role. However, the veteran persevered through less-than-ideal circumstances and continued to display a prolific connection with Puka Nacua, with whom he connected on seven occasions for 97 yards. The biggest offensive play of the night also transpired between the two, as Stafford hit the standout receiver for a 51-yard completion to open a late fourth-quarter drive that culminated in a field goal. The veteran signal-caller did see a four-game streak of multiple touchdown passes come to an end, but he has the Rams in solid shape at 8-6 heading into a Week 16 road battle against the Jets on Sunday, Dec. 22.
#### Tyreek Hill (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Hill was unable to take advantage of the fact Jaylen Waddle exited the game with a knee injury in the first half and didn't return, finishing with his lowest catch and yardage totals since Week 7 and 10, respectively. Hill's target total was also his sparsest since the latter contest, and he saw a two-game touchdown streak come to an end. The veteran speedster also was the intended target down the right sideline on Tua Tagovailoa's game-sealing interception, a fitting ending to a disappointing afternoon. Hill's first opportunity to bounce back comes in a Week 16 home matchup against the 49ers.
#### Aaron Jones (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Jones fell short of his third 100-yard effort of 2024 and reaching the 1,000-yard mark on the season, but the veteran back still turned in a solid performance that included his fifth rushing touchdown of the campaign on a one-yard run late in the third quarter. The 30-year-old also extended his streak of games with multiple receptions to four, and his rushing yardage total was his second highest since Week 10. Jones appears to be refreshed down the stretch run as Minnesota continues to push for the No. 1 seed in the NFC, and he'll look to capitalize on a favorable matchup against the Seahawks' run defense in a Week 16 road clash.
#### Hunter Henry (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Henry finished first on the Patriots in receptions and second in targets Sunday, but he ranked fourth in receiving yards in a collective poor offensive showing by New England. The veteran tight end did set a new career high in receptions (64), and he is just 17 yards shy of his current best of 653 receiving yards set back in 2019. Henry's lack of touchdowns (one) holds him back from being a reliable option in fantasy ahead of next Sunday's tilt against Buffalo.
#### Marquez Valdes-Scantling (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Valdes-Scantling briefly exited to get checked for a concussion during the fourth quarter, but he returned for the final drive of the game. The veteran wideout did not record a catch on three targets while quarterback Jake Haener was under center during the first half. He then wound up catching two long passes from rookie Spencer Rattler, who took over coming out of halftime. After totaling four touchdowns in his first three games with the Saints, Valdes-Scantling has gone two games in a row without a score. But, he's logged seven targets in each of these contests, and he's averaged 16.5 yards per catch on 21 targets across five games with New Orleans. The Saints will next play versus Green Bay on Monday, Dec. 23.
#### Malik Nabers (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Nabers led the Giants across the board in receiving categories while posting his third double-digit reception total of his career. The rookie sensation's numbers are all the more admirable considering the team's abysmal quarterback situation, which took another turn for the worse Sunday when Tim Boyle had to replace Tommy DeVito (concussion). Nabers could be working with any of Boyle, DeVito or Drew Lock (heel/elbow) in a Week 16 road matchup against the Falcons.
#### Najee Harris (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** There was limited volume for all skill-position players in the Pittsburgh offense, as the team ran only 41 total offensive plays. Even taking that into account, Harris had a miserable showing as he averaged just 2.3 yards per attempt while also losing a pitch late in the third quarter with the Steelers threatening to score. While Russell Wilson was technically charged with the fumble, Harris did not get a touch for the rest of the game. It's unlikely that usage carries over into a pivotal Week 16 matchup against Baltimore, though Harris has topped 65 rushing yards only once in his last six contests, making him an unreliable fantasy option even with a regular amount of touches.
#### George Kittle (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Kittle co-led the 49ers in receptions while comfortably setting the pace in receiving yards. While the talented tight end's performance was nowhere near the caliber of the season-best 151-yard effort he put up against the Bears in Week 14, he's now eclipsed 60 receiving yards in five of the last seven contests heading into a Week 16 road matchup against the Dolphins on Sunday, Dec. 22.
#### Brock Purdy (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Purdy was able to engineer a short 39-yard drive on the 49ers' second possession that culminated in a field goal, but San Francisco punted the other six times it had the ball in the first half. After another modest 34-yard march that led to three more points to open the second half, Purdy scuffled throughout most of the rest of the contest and also threw an interception on a deep shot to Jauan Jennings with just over five minutes remaining in the game. The Rams would subsequently embark on a marathon 13-play drive that left Purdy with just 11 seconds to try and get the 50 yards necessary for a potential game-winning score, but he threw incomplete and took a sack on the final two plays. Purdy now has thrown for 159 yards or fewer in three of his past four games heading into a Week 16 road trip to face the Dolphins on Sunday, Dec. 22.
#### Nick Westbrook-Ikhine (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Westbrook-Ikhine remained relatively uninvolved in the Tennessee offense for the second straight week, and he now has only five targets combined across his last two games. He's still maintained a near full-time snap rate, so a bounceback is possible. However, Westbrook-Ikhine is also likely to be held back by quarterback play, regardless of whether Mason Rudolph or Will Levis is under center.
