## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 DJ Moore (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Moore was expected to serve in a big role due to Rome Odunze (foot) and Luther Burden (ankle) both being sidelined. However, he made a limited impact early on after suffering an apparent back injury early in the first quarter, while Caleb Williams attempted only nine passes in the first half. Despite the slow start, he managed to play through the injury and played a key role in Chicago's comeback win, delivering long catches of 22 and 20 yards in the fourth quarter. Moore capped off his day with a 46-yard receiving score to give the Bears the win in overtime. This was his highest yardage total of the season, and Moore now has five touchdowns in his last five games.
</div>

### 🟢 Tee Higgins (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Making his return from another one-game absence due to a concussion, Higgins made an immediate impact by connecting with Joe Burrow on a nine-yard TD in the first quarter. He's had to sit out two of the last three weeks while in the concussion protocol, but Higgins had has a nose for the end zone this season whenever he's been in the lineup, finding paydirt in six of his last seven appearances and hauling in 10 touchdowns in total over 13 games in 2025. His next score will set a new career high, a mark he'll look to reach in Week 17 against the Cardinals.
</div>

### 🟢 C.J. Stroud (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Stroud failed to follow up last week's three-score outing with a more modest fantasy performance in Week 16. The 23-year-old returned to his game-manager style of play in which he protected the football and did just enough on offense to secure victory for Houston. The Ohio State product's modest totals resulted in him failing to extend his streak of throwing for 200 or more yards to four games. Stroud's low ceiling in fantasy makes him a middling option for Week 17 in a road matchup against the Chargers.
</div>

### 🟢 Juwan Johnson (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Johnson tied his season high for receptions and came three receiving yards shy of his season high as Tyler Shough threw for a career-high 308 yards. This was the sixth consecutive game with at least four receptions for Johnson, who has emerged as a steady contributor in a Saints passing game that lacks appealing healthy alternatives behind Chris Olave. Johnson will look to keep building momentum in Week 17 against the Titans.
</div>

### 🟢 Tyler Shough (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Shough posted the first 300-yard passing performance of his NFL career, pushing past his previous career high of 282 passing yards. The highlight of the rookie second-round pick's impressive performance was a 23-yard touchdown pass to Chris Olave in the third quarter, as Shough carried the offense with his arm while the Saints played with a depleted backfield. Shough and the Saints will take a three-game winning streak into an eminently winnable Week 17 road game against the Titans.
</div>

### 🟢 Devin Singletary (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Singletary played second fiddle to Tyrone Tracy, who turned 16 carries and two targets into 78 scrimmage yards. Despite Tracy working in the lead role, Singletary has notched double-digit touches in six of the past seven games in the Giants' run-heavy offense. Both running backs could find success in Week 17 against the vulnerable Raiders defense.
</div>

### 🟢 Breece Hall (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Hall has notched at least 14 rushing attempts in 10 of the last 12 games as the most consistent option in the Jets' lackluster offense. He needs 46 rushing yards over the final two games of the regular season to reach 1,000 for the first time in his four-year NFL career. Hall will try to hit that benchmark in Week 17 against the Patriots.
</div>

### 🟢 Dallas Goedert (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Goedert took a step back from his involvement in the Eagles' offense relative to the last two games, but he still managed to make a significant impact. His primary contribution came late in the third quarter, when he hauled in a 15-yard touchdown on a long third down. Goedert's target total will likely remain inconsistent moving forward, though he has either 70 receiving yards or a touchdown in three consecutive contests.
</div>

### 🟡 Calvin Austin III (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 Kendrick Bourne (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Bourne was inserted into the starting lineup in place of injured teammate Ricky Pearsall (ankle/knee) and finished fourth in team targets. The 29-year-old Bourne was unable to recreate the gaudy receiving numbers we saw in Weeks 5 and 6 when he was asked to start in place of injured starters then. If Pearsall remains sidelined against the Bears and TE George Kittle (ankle) is also unable to go, then that scenario could produce enough meat on the bone for Bourne to eat in Week 17.
</div>

### 🟢 Jauan Jennings (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jennings' short touchdown grab on the 49ers' first possession of the second half extended the wideout's scoring streak four games. The 27-year-old has shown a strong nose for the end zone in the second half of the season as well, scoring seven of his career-best eight touchdowns in 2025 over his last seven starts. Jennings was already being asked to play a larger role on offense with WR Ricky Pearsall (ankle/knee) back on the sidelines, and that role could expand further if TE George Kittle (ankle) is forced to miss time after going down in Monday's win. Things are lining up for Jennings to close out the fantasy campaign with a bang, starting with Sunday's home tilt against the Bears.
</div>

### 🟢 Zach Charbonnet (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Charbonnet was two carries behind Kenneth Walker, and although the latter outgained him by 68 rushing yards and 42 receiving yards, the former was able to join his backfield mate in scoring a rushing touchdown. Charbonnet recorded a four-yard TD run in the first quarter to open the scoring, and he alertly picked up a ball in the end zone on a fourth-quarter two-point conversion attempt after it had initially been batted by Jared Verse and subsequently ruled a backward pass. Charbonnet continues to operate in a reliable complementary role alongside Walker and now has nine rushing touchdowns on the season, affording him some standalone fantasy value in deeper formats for a Week 17 road matchup against the Panthers on Sunday, Dec. 28.
</div>

### 🟢 Kenneth Walker III (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Walker delivered quite the spark early in the second half, rattling off a season-high 55-yard touchdown run off right guard to erase what had been a 13-7 deficit. The performance marked Walker's second 100-yard effort of the season, and he also delivered a season-long 46-yard catch on his way to a season-high receiving yardage total. Walker outpaced backfield mate Zach Charbonnet by two carries and 68 rushing yards Thursday, but the two players are likely to remain in their usual narrow timeshare in a Week 17 road matchup against the Panthers on Sunday, Dec. 28
</div>

### 🟢 Terry McLaurin (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> McLaurin looked to be in for a solid game, logging each of his receptions and all of his yardage by halftime. His biggest impact came on a 40-yard catch deep down the left sideline, when he beat Adoree' Jackson midway through the second quarter. The Commanders' entire passing game became limited after Marcus Mariota (hand) was forced to exit early in the third quarter, which led to a muted stat line for McLaurin. He would be a very risky fantasy option in Week 17 against the Cowboys if Josh Johnson is the starter.
