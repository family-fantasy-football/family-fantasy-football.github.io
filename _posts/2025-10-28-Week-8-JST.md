## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟡 Emari Demercado (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟡 Michael Penix Jr. (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Morris said the same of top wideout Drake London (hip), who joined Penix on the sideline during Atlanta's loss to the Dolphins in Week 8. Veteran backup Kirk Cousins struggled to move the offense in place of Penix, completing 21 of 31 passes for 173 yards with no touchdowns (or interceptions) during the 34-10 loss while also rushing twice for two yards. It will bode well for the Falcons offense if both Penix and London are able to get back on the field as the team prepares for a Week 9 road matchup against New England. Penix was limited in practice all of Week 8 due to a bone bruise in his knee, so he may need to resume handling full reps before being cleared to return to the starting lineup.
</div>

### 🟢 Rome Odunze (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Olamide Zaccheaus tied him for the team lead in receptions, but otherwise Odunze was Caleb Williams' clear top downfield option again after a couple lackluster performances, as he topped 100 yards for the first time since Week 2. The second-year wideout sports a 31-473-5 line on 56 targets through seven games, and Odunze will take renewed momentum into a Week 9 clash with the Bengals.
</div>

### 🟢 D'Andre Swift (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The 26-year-old running back accounted for Chicago's only TD of the day on a two-yard run early in the fourth quarter that briefly brought the team within a field goal at 16-13. Swift has a four-game touchdown streak going, scoring three on the ground and one through the air, and over that stretch he's averaged 111 scrimmage yards a contest. Swift could be headed for another big performance in Week 9 against a vulnerable Bengals defense that just got gashed by Breece Hall for 133 rushing yards and two TDs, plus a four-yard touchdown toss on a trick play.
</div>

### 🟢 Caleb Williams (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The second-year quarterback was able to move the ball early, but Williams' inability to get the ball into the end zone eventually cost the Bears after their first two drives ended in field goals. It's the second straight game in which he's failed to produce a TD, and both came against what were statistically poor defenses in New Orleans and Baltimore. Williams will try to get back on track against another vulnerable unit in Week 9 as Chicago faces a Cincinnati defense that just squandered a late lead and handed Justin Fields and the Jets their first win of the season.
</div>

### 🟢 Travis Kelce (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Kelce turned back the clock with a vintage stat line while leading his club in receiving in a one-sided victory. It also was the most yards the star tight end has recorded in a game through eight starts in 2025. The return of top wideout Rashee Rice in Week 7 has not cut into Kelce's production, with the latter averaging 4.5 receptions and 76.5 yards in the two games QB Patrick Mahomes' top targets have been active together this year. Look for Kelce to remain involved against the Bills in a matchup between AFC contenders Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Hunter Henry (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Fortunately for those who had Henry in Week 8 lineups, his season low in targets still yielded fantasy production. Looking ahead to the Patriots' Week 9 game against the Falcons, Henry --  who was on the field for 52 of 68 snaps on offense versus Cleveland, per Mike Reiss of ESPN.com -- merits fantasy consideration given that he continues to see steady playing time and has compiled a 25-317-4 receiving line on 37 targets through eight games.
</div>

### 🟢 Chris Olave (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Olave was unable to replicate last week's multi-score performance, but he still escaped Sunday's one-sided loss with a solid PPR score. The Saints' top wideout finished with double-digit targets for the sixth time in eight appearances this season. Olave has surpassed last year's production in an injury-shortened season with a 52-503-3 receiving line through eight starts in 2025. The Ohio State product checks in as New Orleans' safest fantasy option heading into next Sunday's tilt against the Rams.
</div>

### 🟢 Will Shipley (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Shipley appears to have slipped to third on the depth chart, as his eight offensive snaps were only half of those played by Tank Bigsby, who carried the ball nine times. Saquon Barkley exited with a groin injury at the end of the third quarter but believes he'll be good to go after the team's Week 9 bye. If Barkley does wind up missing time, Shipley should play a larger role than normal in Week 10 against the Packers but would likely still see fewer touches than Bigsby.
</div>

### 🟢 DeVonta Smith (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> With A.J. Brown (hamstring) sidelined, Smith led the Eagles in catches, targets and receiving yards, although he watched all four of Jalen Hurts' TD passes go to teammates. Philly gets a Week 9 bye, so Brown may not miss any further action, but the bigger issue for the defending champions might be the groin injury Saquon Barkley picked up in Sunday's win. Even if Barkley is healthy when the Eagles head to Green Bay in Week 10, Smith still sports an impressive 44-588-2 line on 55 targets through eight games as part of a surging passing attack.
</div>

### 🟢 Jalen Hurts (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Eagles QB didn't need to air it out much, as both Saquon Barkley (groin) and Tank Bigsby topped 100 rushing yards on the afternoon, but Hurts was surgical when he did throw it, hitting Dallas Goedert for a pair of TDs and sending one each to Barkley and Jahan Dotson. The four scores tied Hurts' career high, a mark he reached in both 2022 and 2023, and he's thrown multiple touchdowns in five of the last six contests, amassing a 15:1 TD:INT over that stretch. Hurts will get a well-earned rest on Philly's Week 9 bye before taking on the Packers at Lambeau Field in Week 10.
</div>

### 🟢 Kaleb Johnson (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Johnson's lack of usage continued during Sunday's primetime matchup, as he was held off the field for a second consecutive matchup. The rookie entered the season with intriguing potential, but Jaylen Warren has continued to operate as Pittsburgh's primary running back in 2025, while Kenneth Gainwell has consistently served as the No. 2 option. Johnson has appeared in just four games this season, rushing 14 times for 36 yards while failing to secure his lone target.
</div>

### 🟢 DK Metcalf (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Metcalf found his way back into the end zone after watching his scoring streak of four games come to an end in Week 7. The five receptions tied the athletic wideout's previous high through seven games with his new club, signaling a dip in volume following his transition from Seattle to Pittsburgh this past offseason. The Steelers' No. 1 receiver currently sits at 27 receptions on 43 targets through seven starts, a pace well off the 66 receptions he recorded in each of his last two seasons as a member of the Seahawks. Metcalf has offset the decreased usage with improved red-zone prowess, matching the five touchdowns he recorded in 2024 in less than half of the games played. The total package is good enough to warrant starting consideration in the majority of fantasy formats heading into next Sunday's tilt against Indianapolis.
</div>

### 🟢 Christian McCaffrey (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> McCaffrey's fantasy outlook was a bit dimmer than usual coming in due to the quality of the Texans' defense, but the way the game unfolded made matters even more of an uphill battle. McCaffrey's carry, rushing yardage, receiving yardage and catch totals were all season lows, and nearly all his production as a receiver came on San Francisco's penultimate drive when he accrued 39 of his 43 receiving yards on a pair of receptions. Given McCaffrey's body of work prior to Sunday, the downturn could certainly be labeled an outlier that the star back should have ample opportunity to bounce back from in a favorable Week 9 road matchup against the Giants next Sunday afternoon.
</div>

### 🟢 Rachaad White (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> White got another start in place of injured starter Bucky Irving (foot/shoulder) in Week 8, leading the Buccaneers' backfield in carries (13) and touches (15) in a comfortable win. That's where the good news ends, as backfield mate Sean Tucker (12-42-1) finished as the team's leading rusher while scoring its only touchdown on offense Sunday. With the Buccaneers on a bye in Week 9, there is a possibility that Irving could be ready to return when Tampa Bay resumes play against New England on Nov. 9. White would lose nearly all of his fantasy value in that scenario, so managers have to weigh whether it is worth holding on to the backup through the bye week.
