## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Tyler Allgeier (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Allgeier surprisingly tied starter Bijan Robinson in carries a week after being limited to two touches against the Buccaneers. That's where the comparisons end, as the latter went off for 92 yards and a score as a receiver out of the backfield compared to the backup's negative production in that area Sunday. Allgeier's 16 carries tied his personal high this season, a total he reached twice back in Weeks 2 and 4. Allgeier's 126-475-8 rushing line across 15 games highlights his touchdown dependency while serving as Atlanta's change-of-pace back. The talented backup provides just enough upside to warrant flex consideration against the Rams next Monday.
</div>

### 🟡 David Njoku (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 Evan Engram (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Engram remained relatively uninvolved in the Broncos' offense, finishing fifth on the team in targets. He did manage a long catch of 33 yards, which ultimately helped set up a touchdown. Engram has two or fewer catches in three consecutive games and has combined to record only 56 yards in that span.
</div>

### 🟢 Brian Thomas Jr. (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Thomas had shown some promising signs in recent weeks after underperforming for most of the season. However, he found opportunity hard to come by in Sunday's upset win, as he finished fifth on the team in targets. His longest gain went for only nine yards, and he was held to his lowest yardage total from scrimmage on the campaign.
</div>

### 🟡 Rashee Rice (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Rice hasn't practiced in any fashion since reporting concussion symptoms following the Chiefs' Week 15 loss to the Chargers. Given the unlikelihood that he'll be deemed ready to take contact Wednesday and clear the five-step concussion protocol prior to Thursday's matchup with the Broncos, Rice looks on track to miss a second straight game.
</div>

### 🟢 Isiah Pacheco (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Kareem Hunt saw only three carries on the day, and one of them turned into a two-yard loss for a safety in the second quarter. As a result, Pacheco saw his biggest touch volume since Week 7 and put together season-high numbers as a receiver. The Kansas City offense is in shambles with Patrick Mahomes and Gardner Minshew going down with knee injuries in consecutive weeks, leaving Chris Oladokun as the likely starting QB for what's left of a lost season. With the team already eliminated from playoff contention, the veteran Hunt could be phased out of the offense, with Pacheco and even 2025 seventh-round pick Brashard Smith seeing more work over the final two weeks, including in a Week 17 battle against the Broncos.
</div>

### 🟢 Ladd McConkey (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> McConkey will be hard-pressed to surpass his yardage total from last year given the litany of offensive-line injuries Los Angeles has tried to survive, but the second-year wideout has quietly become a potent scoring threat -- he tallied his 13th touchdown of his career Sunday. The 24-year-old has yet to surpass 50 receiving yards since a stretch where he exceeded the mark in five consecutive games in Weeks 6-10. That directly coincides with the timing of the injury to Joe Alt (ankle) and bears keeping in mind for fantasy managers ahead of a difficult matchup against the Texans in Week 17.
</div>

### 🟢 De'Von Achane (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The highlight of Achane's afternoon came on his 48-yard scoring scamper late in the first quarter, which served as his third-longest run of the season. Achane's touchdown was his eighth on the ground in 2025, with five of those coming within the last six contests. Achane also now has multiple catches in consecutive contests heading into a Week 17 home matchup against the Buccaneers next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Wan'Dale Robinson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Robinson caught Jaxson Dart's only first-half completion for a two-yard gain as the Giants went with a run-heavy game plan. Dart ultimately threw for only 33 yards. Robinson is the top option in the Giants' depleted passing offense, and he had at least eight targets in six consecutive games prior to Sunday's downturn in volume. He'll have a nice opportunity to bounce back in Week 17 against the Raiders.
</div>

### 🟢 Adonai Mitchell (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Mitchell finished second on the team in receiving yards behind backup running back Isaiah Davis' 52. This was the sixth time in as many games with the Jets that Mitchell has drawn at least six targets. Whether the Jets start undrafted rookie Brady Cook at quarterback for a third consecutive game or turn back to one of Tyrod Taylor or Justin Fields (knee), Mitchell should continue to function as the team's top downfield target in Week 17 against the Patriots.
</div>

### 🟢 Tyrod Taylor (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> While managing his pair of injuries, Taylor wasn't available for last week's loss to the Jaguars, paving the way for undrafted rookie Brady Cook to make his first career start. Cook is set to direct the offense once again in Week 16, but Taylor will be available to serve as the No. 2 option after he followed a pair of limited practices Wednesday and Thursday with a full session Friday. If Taylor is able to turn in a full slate of practices next week, he could return to the starting lineup for the Jets' penultimate game of the season against the Patriots, though Cook may retain the top job with a solid showing versus New Orleans.
</div>

### 🟢 Mike Evans (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Evans appeared to be on his way to a big day when he hauled in a one-yard scoring grab with just over four minutes remaining in the first quarter, but he was relatively contained the rest of the afternoon. His day also closed out on a sour note, as Scott Smith of the team's official site reports Evans misread Baker Mayfield's intentions on a fourth-quarter pass that resulted in a game-sealing interception for Carolina. The Buccaneers still have a chance to win the NFC South by prevailing in their final two contests, however, so Evans will be locked in during a Week 17 road matchup against a beatable Dolphins secondary.
</div>

### 🟢 Baker Mayfield (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Buccaneers went with an extremely run-heavy approach in the first half, and although Mayfield was a lot busier in the second half thanks to game script, he still finished with his third sub-200-yard tally in the last four games. Mayfield also tossed a pick for the third consecutive contest, with Sunday's interception -- an apparent miscommunication with Mike Evans -- coming at the Panthers' 30 with 49 seconds remaining and Tampa Bay driving for a game-tying field-goal attempt, at minimum. Despite the stumble, Mayfield can still lead the Bucs to another NFC South title with a win over the Dolphins in Week 17 and a victory against Carolina at home in the regular-season finale a week later.
</div>

### 🟢 Jayden Daniels (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Out<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
