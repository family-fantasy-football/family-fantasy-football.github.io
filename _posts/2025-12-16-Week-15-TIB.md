## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Darnell Mooney (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Mooney played 92 offensive snaps with Drake London (knee) sidelined again, but he was outpaced in the receiving game by all of Kyle Pitts (11-166-3), Bijan Robinson (8-82-0) and David Sills (6-78-0). Across 12 regular-season appearances so far, Mooney has surpassed 50 receiving yards on just two occasions. He'll remain difficult to trust for fantasy purposes Week 16 on the road against Arizona, even if London is unavailable again.
</div>

### 🟢 Kyle Pitts Sr. (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The oft-maligned tight end delivered exactly the type of performance that many assumed would be his standard following his selection with the fourth overall pick back in the 2021 Draft. Pitts set new single-game career highs with all three components of his receiving line, and he recorded his touchdown grabs from eight, 17 and seven yards out. He spectacularly snapped a nine-game TD drought in the process, and after topping out at 70 receiving yards over his first 11 games, the fifth-year pro has now recorded at least 82 such yards in three consecutive contests. Pitts will try to put together a fitting encore against the Cardinals when the Falcons pay a visit to Arizona for a Week 16 matchup on Sunday, Dec. 21.
</div>

### 🟢 Mark Andrews (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Ravens defense dominated, which didn't leave much for Lamar Jackson and the passing attack to do. Andrews has caught two or fewer passes in three of the last four games, managing just an 8-83-0 line on 17 targets over that stretch, and his struggles have largely been tied to Jackson's own lack of production. The duo may need to re-establish their connection in Week 16 against the Patriots to keep Baltimore's playoff hopes alive.
</div>

### 🟢 Keon Coleman (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> On a snowy Sunday, Josh Allen completed passes to nine different teammates, with much of his production going to tight ends Dawson Knox (6-93-0) and Dalton Kincaid (4-41-1). None of Buffalo's wide receivers had more than two catches or 21 yards, though Khalil Shakir did manage a TD reception. Coleman was a healthy scratch for both Week 11 and Week 12 due to disciplinary measures, and in two games since returning to action, he's tallied four catches on six targets for 25 yards and a touchdown.
</div>

### 🟢 Tetairoa McMillan (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> McMillan tied for the team lead in targets, though both Jalen Coker and Tommy Tremble also had four targets. McMillan managed a 21-yard reception late in the second quarter to convert on fourth down, but he was otherwise unable to impact the game. He has now been held below 50 receiving yards in three straight games, though this performance also ended his three-contest touchdown streak.
</div>

### 🟢 Javonte Williams (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Williams picked up 13 yards and a touchdown on the Cowboys' first offensive possession, but he then sat out the rest of the first half with a shoulder injury. While he rotated with Malik Davis more than usual in the second half, Williams managed to run and put together a good showing with chunk gains of 21, 15 and 11 yards in the final two quarters. After averaging only 3.4 yards per carry combined across the last two games, this was a solid bounceback effort for Williams, particularly considering he almost certainly wasn't playing at 100 percent.
</div>

### 🟢 Josh Jacobs (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jacobs' status for this matchup looked to be in doubt for much of the week, as he didn't take the practice field until Friday due to a knee injury. However, he popped for several big plays against the Broncos, including a 40-yard rushing touchdown and an impressive 14-yard score on a contested catch in the corner of the end zone. After being reliant upon touchdowns and volume for long stretches early in the season, Jacobs has recorded a gain of at least 20 yards on the ground in three straight contests. He also has at least 70 rushing yards in five of his last six games.
</div>

### 🟡 Nick Chubb (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟡 Quentin Johnston (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 Malik Washington (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Washington finished second on the team in targets behind only Jaylen Waddle (3-50-1 on seven targets), though Tua Tagovailoa looked the way of Darren Waller, Greg Dulcich, and Jaylen Wright three times each, and the early departure of De'Von Achane (ribs) knocked out one of the Dolphins' usual top contributors in the passing game. Though Washington has established a fair floor with at least three catches in eight of his last nine appearances, he's yet to surpass 50 receiving yards this season and lacks a demonstrable ceiling heading into Miami's matchup against the Steelers on Monday Night Football in Week 15.
</div>

### 🟢 Justin Jefferson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jefferson stayed under 25 receiving yards for the third straight appearance despite the Vikings rattling off consecutive wins. The chemistry with QB J.J. McCarthy is simply not there at the moment, with the duo generating a 50 percent catch rate or worse during the wideout's three-game skid in fantasy. Jefferson had a prime opportunity to turn his fortunes around in the second half when McCarthy rifled a pass to the corner of the end zone that hit his star receiver in the hands before dropping harmlessly to the ground. Fantasy managers may have no choice but to stick with Jefferson through his career-worst slump, as he possesses the skill to break out against the Giants next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Theo Johnson (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The second-year tight end led the Giants in receiving yards on the day, as he topped 70 yards for the third time in the last five games. Johnson is quietly having a breakout campaign despite the struggles of the rest of the team, putting together a 45-528-5 line on 72 targets through 14 contests. He'll look to keep rolling in a Week 16 clash with the Vikings.
</div>

### 🟡 Justin Fields (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 Aaron Rodgers (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Rodgers turned back the clock on Monday Night Football and put on a passing display reminiscent of his heydays in Green Bay. The 41-year-old completed a season-high 85 percent of his attempts in the decisive victory, while hurling multiple touchdown passes for the first time since Week 8 against the Packers -- coincidentally. Rodgers has strung together a pair of strong fantasy outings in favorable matchups, and he'll have another opportunity to produce a third against the Lions' 24th-ranked pass defense in Week 16.
</div>

### 🟢 Chris Godwin Jr. (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Godwin tied for second in receptions on the night for the Buccaneers, even with both Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan being active, and despite his very modest yardage total, he still delivered a serviceable fantasy night thanks to his three-yard TD grab and ensuing two-point conversion catch early in the fourth quarter. The TD was Godwin's first of the season, and he's now accumulated nine receptions over his last two games heading into a Week 16 road matchup against the Panthers on Sunday, Dec. 21.
</div>

### 🟢 Marcus Mariota (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Mariota will close out the 2025 campaign under center for the Commandeers, while Josh Johnson works as the team's No. 2 quarterback. The veteran signal-caller completed 10 of just 19 pass attempts for 211 yards and one touchdown during Sunday's divisional win over the Giants, while rushing 10 times for 43 yards. Mariota also fumbled twice versus New York, losing one. Next on deck for Mariota and Washington will be a home matchup against the Eagles on Saturday, after which the team will have a short preparation window before taking on the Cowboys on Thursday Night Football in Week 17. Mariota's last game of the season will be a Week 18 road rematch against Philadelphia.
