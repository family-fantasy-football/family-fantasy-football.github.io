## Player Report

#### Emari Demercado (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Demercado was expected to see an expanded role in the absence of Trey Benson (knee), but Michael Carter dominated opportunities out of the backfield. Demercado's lack of involvement as a pass catcher was particularly surprising, as he was not targeted. He looked to have made the case for a more expanded role with a long 72-yard touchdown run early in the fourth quarter, but he fumbled on a premature celebration before crossing the goal line for a touchback. The Cardinals still gave him one additional touch before the end of the game, but the key error isn't likely to help his role heading into a Week 6 matchup against the Colts.
#### Michael Penix Jr. (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** After a rough Week 3 performance on the road in Carolina, Penix returned home in Week 4 and looked much more composed, topping his prior career high in yardage by one as he delivered his first multi-TD effort of 2025. The second-year QB hit Drake London for a five-yard score in the first quarter and Kyle Pitts for a seven-yard touchdown in the third, while both London and Bijan Robinson eclipsed the century mark in receiving yards, during a game in which Atlanta never trailed. Penix will get a week off for the Falcons' bye before facing a tough test in Week 6 against the Bills.
#### D'Andre Swift (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Swift was limited during the practice week with a hip injury that had him listed as questionable leading up to Sunday's kickoff. The veteran RB suited up and rewarded fantasy managers with his second trip to the end zone in four games this season. The Bears placed no restrictions on Swift, handing him 14 of its 18 running back carries in the win. He has been generating just enough value on a weekly basis to warrant flex consideration in most formats, but he won't be available in Week 5 with the Bears on a bye, making Week 6 the next time Swift will be in action.
#### Caleb Williams (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Williams also put two balls on the ground, but he was fortunately able to recover both of his fumbles. The sophomore QB was coming off his best game of the season against the Cowboys, but he reverted to inconsistent form Sunday. We have seen flashes of brilliance from Williams in new head coach Ben Johnson's scheme, but he still isn't polished enough to be relied upon regularly. With the Bears entering their bye, Williams' next action will come in Week 6 on Oct. 13 against the Commanders on Monday Night Football.
#### Rome Odunze (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Odunze's scoring onslaught continued when he gutted the Raiders' secondary for a 27-yard touchdown on Chicago's first possession of the second half. The breakout fantasy star has generated five touchdowns during his impressive four-game scoring streak to kick off the season. Odunze's eight targets Sunday were on par with his 8.8 average through four weeks, giving fantasy managers a reliable WR1 asset so far. The talented sophomore will attempt to extend his scoring streak when the Bears resume play against the Commanders in Week 6 on Oct. 13 following the team's upcoming bye.
#### Travis Kelce (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Kelce finally put it all together for his managers Week 5, producing his best fantasy score through five starts. The 35-year-old finished with a season-high seven receptions while scoring his second touchdown of the campaign. Even with his slow start to the season, Kelce is providing enough of a floor for fantasy managers with a 22-243-2 receiving line in 2025. Up next for the Chiefs will be a home tilt against a hot Lions squad on Sunday Night Football in Week 6.
#### Hunter Henry (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Henry ripped off a pair of 20-plus yard receptions in order to check in as the Patriots' second-leading receiver despite finishing with just the two receptions Sunday. The veteran starter failed to extend his modest scoring streak to three games on a night when the passing offense accounted for zero touchdowns. Henry has been a pleasant surprise in fantasy crossing the quarter point of the regular season, producing a 17-250-3 receiving line heading into a Week 6 matchup against the Saints next Sunday.
#### Chris Olave (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** The catches and targets were both team highs, but Olave's output was overshadowed by an 87-yard TD by Rashid Shaheed in the second quarter that sparked the Saints' offense to life. Olave remains the the top option for QB Spencer Rattler, but his volume hasn't resulted in any big performances yet in 2025 -- despite seeing double-digit targets in four of five games and 53 looks in total, he sports just a 33-244-1 line, and Sunday's 59 receiving yards were actually his season high. He'll try to make a bigger impact in Week 6 against the Patriots.
#### DeVonta Smith (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Smith shook off a highly undesirable matchup on paper to produce team-best totals in receptions, receiving yards and targets on the afternoon, as well as a season-long 52-yard catch. The Eagles' unusual pass-centric approach Sunday certainly helped Smith's numbers, but even on lower-volume days for the air attack, Smith has been the more consistent producer between him and A.J. Brown by far through Philadelphia's first five games. Smith will take a 25-272-1 receiving line on 30 targets into a favorable Week 6 road matchup against the Giants on Thursday night.
#### Jalen Hurts (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Despite the Broncos' standout secondary and the fact they held a  lead for a significant portion of the game, the Eagles curiously took a pass-centric approach Sunday, affording Saquon Barkley a scant six carries. Hurts recorded season highs in completions, pass attempts and passing yards, while also recording multiple touchdown tosses for the third consecutive game by connecting with Dallas Goedert (two yards) and Barkley (47 yards) in the second and third quarters, respectively. However, Hurts also took a season-high six sacks, and he threw incomplete on back-to-back plays from the Broncos' 29-yard line to finish the game. Hurts was also much less involved than usual as a runner, but he draws an excellent matchup on a short week when the Eagles visit the Giants on Thursday night to kick off Week 6.
#### Kaleb Johnson (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Jaylen Warren's (knee) absence opened up a lot of opportunity in the Pittsburgh backfield. Kenneth Gainwell was the primary back and performed well, though Johnson did see the most significant opportunity of his rookie season. He was servicable in the role, picking up 14 yards on the ground on a drive early in the fourth quarter to help the Steelers to a field goal.  Johnson isn't likely to see much of a role when Pittsburgh returns to the field in Week 6, but it was a small step forward after a poor start to his rookie campaign.
#### DK Metcalf (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Metcalf found the end zone in his third straight game while also tallying his first 100-yard receiving game as a Steeler. He did the majority of his damage on an 80-yard touchdown early in the second quarter, which came nearly entirely after the catch. Metcalf continues to be Aaron Rodgers' favorite target among the downfield pass catchers, and he has at least 80 receiving yards in half of his four games in his nascent Steelers tenure.
#### Rachaad White (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** White got the spot-start in place of injured starter Bucky Irving (foot/shoulder) on Sunday, commanding 14 of the 18 carries Tampa Bay gave to its running backs in the win. The 26-year-old White masked an inefficient day on the ground (2.9 YPC) with a pair of trips to the end zone in a strong overall fantasy performance. Initial reports hinted that Irving could also miss next Sunday's tilt against the 49ers, a scenario that would unlock another week of fantasy utility for White in Week 6.
