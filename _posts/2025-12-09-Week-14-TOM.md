## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟡 Marvin Harrison Jr. (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 Jacoby Brissett (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Brissett got off to a hot start when he drove his team down the field for a touchdown pass on the game's opening possession. The veteran signal-caller was clamped down from there salvaging his day from a fantasy perspective with a garbage-time touchdown in the fourth quarter. Brissett's three-game streak of reaching 300 passing yards came to an end Sunday, but he is still posting voluminous passing numbers while starting for the fledgling Cardinals. Kyler Murray (foot) has still not been reinstated off injured reserve, leaving Brissett to handle a rough road matchup against the Texans next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 James Cook III (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The star running back had a little trouble holding onto the ball in snowy, cold conditions, committing two fumbles and losing one, but he reached 100 scrimmage yards for a fourth straight game and the sixth time in the last seven contests. Over that stretch, Cook has piled up 771 rushing yards and three TDs on the ground while adding a 17-178-1 line on 17 targets. He'll face a much tougher test in Week 15 against the Patriots' stingy run defense.
</div>

### 🟢 Dalton Kincaid (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> After being listed as limited at practice Wednesday through Friday, Kincaid, who last saw game action in Week 10, was deemed questionable to face Cincinnati. With his return to Buffalo's lineup confirmed, Kincaid will have an opportunity to reclaim his status as his team's top pass-catching tight end, a role that has resulted in him logging a 29/448/4 receiving line on 36 targets through the eight contests he's suited up for, a level of production that keeps the 2023 first-rounder on the fantasy lineup radar, when healthy.
</div>

### 🟢 Jared Goff (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Goff put together a solid all-around performance in a game where he had the benefit of the lead for the majority of the time, averaging 9.1 yards per attempt on the way to his third 300-yard effort of the season. The veteran signal-caller completed five passes of 20-plus yards overall, with Jameson Williams, Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jahmyr Gibbs serving as his top three targets and Isaac TeSlaa on the receiving end of his one touchdown pass (12 yards). Goff boasts an impressive 70.1 percent completion rate and elite 26:5 TD:INT heading into a Week 15 road clash against his old Rams squad on Dec. 14.
</div>

### 🟢 Romeo Doubs (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Doubs' role in the offense fizzled in Week 14, no doubt in large part due to the return of Jayden Reed from injured reserve. It is worth noting that Jordan Love targeted 10 different pass catchers, and no Packers player saw more than four targets during Sunday's game. It was the first time Doubs failed to record a catch this season, and the third-year wide receiver sits at a 45-542-5 line on 73 targets through 13 regular-season games. He'll look to bounce back in Week 15 against the Broncos on Sunday, Dec. 14.
</div>

### 🟢 Jayden Higgins (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Higgins finished second on the team in targets, receptions and yards, with Nico Collins being the only Texans pass catcher who was able to produce much. While his stat line wasn't spectacular, Higgins did convert a pair of first downs in the game, both of which were pivotal in Houston securing a win. He now has at least five targets in five straight games and will benefit from a better matchup in Week 15 against the Cardinals.
</div>

### 🟢 Tyler Warren (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Warren maintained a solid role in the Colts' offense, finishing third on the team with six targets. However, he struggled to get on the same page with Riley Leonard, converting only one of his five targets into a catch, which went for only two yards. While that could change for the better moving forward, Warren's outlook has worsened due to Daniel Jones (Achilles) being out for the rest of the season.
</div>

### 🟢 Ashton Jeanty (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Raiders were within one possession for nearly three quarters of the game, though they still attempted only 12 rushes. Jeanty accounted for 10 of those, but his longest gain went for only six yards, and three of his 10 carries went for two yards or fewer. He's now been held to 50 rushing yards or fewer in five of his last six games, and he also had his lowest reception total since Week 7.
</div>

### 🔴 Omarion Hampton (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Kimani Vidal got the start, but Hampton quickly was brought back into the fold after missing the past seven games due to an ankle injury, finishing with an even distribution of the 30 touches from the backfield. It's unclear if that was a counter to Philadelphia's ferocious front seven, or if the duo of Vidal and Hampton will truly have an even split moving forward, but the rookie 2025 first-round pick did have the most explosive of the carries (long of 18 yards). Up next is another difficult matchup against a Kansas City defense fighting for their playoff lives.
</div>

### 🟢 Blake Corum (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Corum was able to take advantage of starter Kyren Williams' brief absence in Week 13 in order to elevate his game in the loss to the Panthers. The talented backup benefited from a favorable game script Sunday that afforded him the opportunity to pad his stats in garbage time of the blowout win over the Cardinals. That said, Corum did score the first of his two touchdowns when the game was closer in the first half. The Michigan product has carved out a nice role behind Williams this season, but it would be stunning if Corum could maintain this level of production as the change-of-pace option against the Lions next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Kayshon Boutte (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Boutte tied Hunter Henry for the team lead in receptions and brought in one of Drake Maye's two touchdown passes, recording a three-yard scoring grab with one minute remaining in the first quarter. Five of Boutte's six touchdowns on the campaign have come within the last six contests, although he's only totaled 50 receiving yards in the last three games. Boutte next takes aim at the Bills' talented secondary in a Week 15 home clash on Sunday, Dec. 14 following a Week 14 bye.
</div>

### 🟢 Jaxson Dart (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Dart returned from a two-game absence after clearing the league's concussion protocol in order to reclaim his starting gig ahead of Monday's primetime tilt. The rookie signal-caller was understandably conservative from the pocket -- after already being checked for a possible concussion four times since the preseason -- finishing with the second-lowest passing yardage total through eight starts. The Ole Miss product also recorded his lowest carry total while failing to extend his rushing touchdown streak to six games. Dart has been a fantasy revelation in his first year as a pro, generating 1,893 yards from scrimmage with 18 touchdowns to five turnovers heading into the Giants' Week 14 bye. The dual-threat quarterback will look to build confidence in a favorable home matchup against the Commanders when play resumes on Sunday, Dec. 14.
</div>

### 🟢 AJ Barner (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Barner followed up Wednesday's limited session with all activity one day later, clearing him to continue serving as the Seahawks' No. 1 tight end. In such a role, he's put together a respectable 37-359-4 line on 46 targets in 12 games to date.
</div>

### 🟢 Tez Johnson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Johnson went without a target for the first time in his nascent career, despite the fact he logged a solid 34 snaps (46 percent). Johnson now has one or zero catches in three of the last four contests, and with Mike Evans (collarbone) and Jalen McMillan (neck) seemingly on the verge of activation from injured reserve, the rookie could have an even more difficult path to targets down the stretch.
</div>

### 🟢 Chimere Dike (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Dike set the pace in receptions and targets on the afternoon for the Titans while also leading the team's wide receivers in yardage on a day when Cam Ward threw for just 117 yards. It was Dike's second five-catch tally in three games, while his five-yard catch with under 10 minutes remaining served as his third from scrimmage. Dike will continue to operate as the No. 2 receiver in Tennessee's typically low-volume passing attack during a Week 15 road matchup against the 49ers.
</div>

### 🟢 Chris Rodriguez Jr. (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> As the game got away from the Commanders the rushing attack became less of a factor, hurting Rodriguez's volume despite his healthy 5.2 yards per carry. The third-year back also failed to get into the end zone for only the second time in the last seven games. Jayden Daniels' return from an elbow injury only lasted a little over three quarters Sunday, but Rodriguez has found ways to be productive with Marcus Mariota under center as well, and he might be able to exploit a soft Week 15 matchup against the Giants.
