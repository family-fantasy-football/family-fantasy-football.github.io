## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Trey McBride (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> McBride had a rough go of things Sunday, recording his lowest reception and yardage totals of the season against Atlanta. His 50 percent catch rate also checked in as the worst mark through 15 starts in 2025. The star tight end still finished in a tie for the team lead in targets (eight) in what turned out to be a down day for most of Arizona's top receiving options. The dud did little to thwart McBride's stellar fantasy campaign (109-1,099-10), and he needs just 48 receiving yards against the Bengals next Sunday to set a new high-water mark for his career in that category.
</div>

### 🟢 Chuba Hubbard (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Hubbard logged three fewer carries than Rico Dowdle but gained just two less rushing yards, although neither back made a significant impact fantasy-wise. Hubbard surprisingly broke out for an 83-yard showing on the ground against the Chargers three games ago, but otherwise, he's been capped overall by having to share time with Dowdle. The duo will likely continue working in a close timeshare during a Week 17 home matchup against a tough Seahawks defense.
</div>

### 🟢 Kyle Monangai (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Monangai was modestly out-touched by D'Andre Swift, but the rookie was the more productive in Saturday's comeback win. Monangai delivered a few particularly impactful plays, highlighted by a  34-yard catch and run on a screen pass to set up a field goal for the Bears. His longest rushes went for 13 and 11 yards, the latter of which converted a third down and set up Caleb Williams' game-winning throw. Monangai has double-digit touches in six consecutive games while splitting the backfield with Swift, and the former has reached 90 yards from scrimmage twice in that span.
</div>

### 🟢 Ja'Marr Chase (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The superstar wideout topped 100 receiving yards for the seventh time this season, and the third time in four games since Joe Burrow came off IR. During that four-game stretch, Chase has hauled in 31 catches on 49 targets for 395 yards but curiously hasn't gotten into the end zone once, and his TD drought stands at six games. He'll look to hit paydirt for the first time since Week 7 in a Week 17 clash with the Cardinals.
</div>

### 🟢 Joe Burrow (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> One week after the Bengals got shut out for the first time with Burrow under center, the 29-year-old quarterback bounced back with his best performance of 2025. Burrow hit Tee Higgins for a nine-yard score in the first quarter before really getting going after halftime, finding Chase Brown for two short TDs in the third quarter before connecting with Mike Gesicki for a 17-yard touchdown in the fourth. Burrow has two four-TD games in the last three weeks and a 10:4 TD:INT in four games since returning from a toe injury, and he'll take aim at another struggling defense in a Week 17 clash with the Cardinals.
</div>

### 🟢 David Montgomery (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Montgomery played a season-low 13 snaps on offense as Detroit failed to ever get the ground game going in Week 16. The running back failed to reach the end zone for the first time since Week 12, and he now has gone six straight contests without garnering double-digit carries and back-to-back without a catch. Montgomery will look to right the ship Christmas Day versus the Vikings.
</div>

### 🟢 Christian Watson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Watson seemed destined to miss time after he suffered a chest injury last Sunday against the Broncos that forced a visit to a Denver-area hospital. Having said that, he followed up no activity at Tuesday's walkthrough with back-to-back limited practices, leaving the door open for him to play this weekend. Coach Matt LaFleur told Zach Kruse of USA Today on Thursday that Wednesday's session was "encouraging" for Watson, but that his availability was "going to come down to a medical decision and where he's at Saturday." With his status now confirmed for Week 16, Watson will join Romeo Doubs, Jayden Reed, Matthew Golden, Dontayvion Wicks (ankle), Bo Melton and Savion Williams as the wide receivers available to QB Jordan Love.
</div>

### 🟢 Dalton Schultz (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Schultz had the highest fantasy score of any pass catcher for Houston on Sunday after coming down with QB C.J. Stroud's only touchdown pass of the contest. It was the veteran tight end's third touchdown catch of the season, surpassing last year's total of two in two fewer games. Schultz is providing a consistent floor for fantasy managers heading into a matchup with the Chargers in Week 17.
</div>

### 🟢 Josh Downs (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Downs led the Colts in receptions and tied Tyler Warren for the team lead in targets, once again displaying some solid chemistry with Philip Rivers after catching the latter's first touchdown pass since the 2020 season in Week 15. Downs has drawn a total of 14 targets over his first two games working with the veteran signal-caller, and he's likely to be busy again in a Week 17 home matchup against the Jaguars on Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Travis Etienne Jr. (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Etienne wasn't particularly efficient in his capacity as a rusher or a receiver, but he still managed a solid performance on 20 total touches while benefiting from the absence of Bhayshul Tuten (finger). His longest gain on the ground nearly resulted in a touchdown, as he went for 24 yards midway through the second quarter before being tackled at the three-yard line. Etienne then managed to reach the end zone on Jacksonville's second possession of the second half, catching a short pass before making a defender miss in the open field for a 10-yard trip to the end zone. Etienne has been inefficient as a runner this season, but he has 10 total touchdowns across his last seven games to remain a very consistent fantasy contributor.
</div>

### 🟢 Matthew Stafford (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Stafford's outstanding numbers, which included a season-high passing yardage total, ultimately went for naught from a real-world football perspective, but the veteran signal-caller certainly delivered handsomely for fantasy managers rolling with him in their playoff games. With Davante Adams (knee/hamstring) sidelined, Stafford unsurprisingly focused even more attention than usual on Puka Nacua, who he'd end up connecting with on 12 occasions for 225 yards and two touchdowns from one yard (fourth quarter) and 41 yards (overtime) out. Stafford also hit rookie tight end Terrance Ferguson from three yards out with under four minutes remaining in the first half for his third three touchdown-pass tally over the last five games, and he'll next take aim at the Falcons in a Week 17 road matchup on Monday night, Dec. 29.
</div>

### 🟢 Rhamondre Stevenson (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Rookie starter TreVeyon Henderson was ruled out at halftime after suffering a concussion in the first half. Stevenson played a large part in the Patriots erasing an 11-point deficit in the fourth quarter when he scampered for a 21-yard touchdown with less than three minutes remaining in the contest. The veteran backup is no stranger to starting for New England, so he would immediately become a hot waiver add if Henderson is unable to clear the league's concussion protocol in time for next Sunday's tilt against the Jets.
</div>

### 🟢 A.J. Brown (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Brown bounced back after seeing only two targets in Philadelphia's Week 15 win, serving as Jalen Hurts' favorite target throughout Saturday's win over the Commanders. He didn't break one particularly long gain, but he did log receptions of 24, 16 and 15 yards. After a volatile start to the year, Brown has double-digit targets in five of his last six games and has at least 95 receiving yards or a touchdown in all but one game in that span.
</div>

### 🟢 Cooper Kupp (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Kupp fumbled at the end of a 17-yard catch late in the first half, but he contributed to Seattle's comeback by securing the first of the Seahawks' three successful two-point conversions, all of which proved pivotal in the one-point win. The former Rams wide receiver continues to work as the distant second option among Seattle's wideouts behind Jaxon Smith-Njigba, as no other Seahawks wide receiver recorded a catch Thursday, though Rashid Shaheed contributed a punt return touchdown and a 31-yard run. Kupp will face the Panthers in Week 17.
</div>

### 🟢 Sam Darnold (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Darnold threw his fifth and sixth interceptions against the Rams this season in the second half, with the first pick leading to a Blake Corum one-yard touchdown one play later. However, the veteran signal-caller bounced back with a 26-yard touchdown strike to AJ Barner with just over six minutes remaining in regulation, and he then led a nine-play, 65-yard march in overtime that he capped off with a four-yard touchdown toss to Jaxon Smith-Njigba. Head coach Mike Macdonald then opted to go for the game-winning two-point conversion, and Darnold delivered once again by finding Eric Saubert to seal the comeback victory. Darnold's multi-touchdown tally was his third in the last five games, and he'll look to carry over the late-game momentum into a Week 17 road matchup against the Panthers on Sunday, Dec. 28.
</div>

### 🟢 Jaxon Smith-Njigba (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Smith-Njigba was shockingly shut out in the first half, but the star wideout made up for it in the second half and overtime. The star wideout delivered his touchdown in the extra period to get Seattle within a point before Eric Saubert snagged a game-winning two-point conversion reception. Prior to the scoring catch, Smith-Njigba also recorded a critical 17-yard reception earlier in the possession to move the Seahawks into Rams territory, and he finished with his best reception tally in the last four games. Smith-Njigba will head into a Week 17 road matchup against the Panthers on Sunday, Dec. 28 with a 104-1,637-10 line on a whopping 143 targets.
