## Player Report

#### Bryce Young (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Young was pulled late for Andy Dalton in the 29-point defeat, and the third-year signal-caller was largely ineffective most of the afternoon. The highlight of his performance came very early, as Young capped off a crisp seven-play opening possession with a seven-yard touchdown pass to Tommy Tremble. The now 1-3 Panthers will try to capitalize on what should be a favorable matchup against the middling Dolphins defense in a Week 5 home clash next Sunday, but coach Dave Canales' patience with Young may be wearing a bit thin.
#### Chase Brown (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Brown's opportunities were limited by game script, but he turned in his most efficient performance of the season as both runner and receiver. Prior to Monday night, Brown hadn't averaged more than 2.9 yards per carry in his first three contests, and his 10.3 yards per catch versus Denver edged the 9.0 figure he'd mustered on two grabs Week 2 against the Jaguars. The Bengals offense appears stuck in the mud over its first two full games with Jake Browning at the helm, however, so Brown's fantasy prospects remain muted heading into a Week 5 home matchup against a tough Lions defense.
#### CeeDee Lamb (WR)
**Injury Status:** Out <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** out
#### Dak Prescott (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Prescott broke out of his early-season slump in a big way, matching his passing touchdown total through his previous three games in one fell swoop. The 31-year-old even added a rare rushing touchdown on a designed run from in close for his fourth score of the contest. The loss of star receiver CeeDee Lamb (ankle) certainly hurts Prescott's stock for as long as his top option remains out. That said, Prescott also proved that he is nowhere near washed up with Sunday's monster fantasy output. Managers with restored faith in Dallas' signal-caller will be rolling him out against the Jets in Week 5.
#### RJ Harvey (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The rookie second-round pick saw his biggest opportunity yet with the Broncos dominating throughout the majority of the last three quarters, and Harvey put his touches to good use. He picked up a pair of first downs on his runs, and he recorded new career highs in receptions and receiving yards while scoring his first NFL touchdown on a 12-yard catch with just under five minutes remaining. Harvey still is a complementary option to lead back J.K. Dobbins, who gained 101 yards on 16 carries Monday, but the rookie could continue to see his role expand in a Week 5 road showdown against the defending champion Eagles.
#### Brenton Strange (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Strange finished in a tie with Brian Thomas for the lead in team targets while leading his club in receptions in a solid overall effort. The 24-year-old tight end has produced 19 receptions for 182 yards through four starts, well ahead of his pace across 17 games last season (40-411-2).  Strange has quietly entered the fantasy conversation at a shallow position as the Jaguars prepare to face Kansas City on Monday Night Football in Week 5.
#### Xavier Worthy (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Worthy returned from a shoulder injury and was active for the first time since Week 1, and he quickly regained his role as Kansas City's top playmaker. He accounted for each of the team's three longest plays from scrimmage on gains ranging from 28 to 37 yards while being used in all areas of the field and on an end around. While Worthy did his damage on big plays, he also led the team in targets, indicating this level of production is sustainable as long as his shoulder holds up.
#### Patrick Mahomes (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Mahomes turned in a vintage effort, perhaps not coincidentally as the return of Xavier Worthy reinforced his wide receiver corps. Mahomes threw four touchdowns in a regular-season game for the first time since Week 10 of the 2023 season, with all four scores coming in the red zone. He primarily attempted passes in the short areas of the field but still recorded six completions of at least 15 yards. This was Mahomes' first game with multiple touchdowns this season, and it also accounted for his highest yardage total of 2025. If Worthy's shoulder holds up, Mahomes could be in for much improved results as the campaign progresses -- particularly once Rashee Rice (suspension) is eligible to return in Week 7.
#### Darren Waller (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** The veteran tight end finally got on the field following his year-plus span on the sideline, with the majority of that absence due to his retirement during the 2024 offseason. Waller also had to overcome a hip issue before getting on the field Monday night, but he mostly looked like his old self while recording four- and nine-yard touchdown grabs in the second and third quarters, respectively. Waller's apparent readiness to immediately contribute is particularly a welcome sight in the context of Miami likely having lost Tyreek Hill for the remainder of the season Monday due to a knee dislocation, as the Dolphins offense will be in need of playmakers to absorb the significant loss.
#### Stefon Diggs (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Drake Maye threw for a relatively modest 203 yards on the afternoon in the easy victory, but Diggs accounted for about half of that in his best game yet as a Patriot. The veteran wideout led New England's pass catchers across the board, including a team-best 33-yard reception, and the performance could serve as a launchpad for Diggs ahead of a marquee Week 5 divisional showdown against his old Bills teammates next Sunday night.
#### Tyrone Tracy Jr. (RB)
**Injury Status:** Out <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** out
#### Cam Skattebo (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** The rookie RB become the focal point of the Giants offense with Jaxson Dart getting his first career NFL start under center and Tyrone Tracy (shoulder) sidelined, with Skattebo's 27 touches representing a huge increase on the career-high 16 he got last week. That volume on the ground came in a contest that New York led from its opening possession, however, a game script that may not be repeated too often in 2025. Devin Singletary got seven carries as the backup with Tracy out, but Skattebo should remain the unquestioned top option in the backfield Week 5 against the Saints.
#### Braelon Allen (RB)
**Injury Status:** Doubtful <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** doubtful
#### Bucky Irving (RB)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Irving suffered a sprained foot during Tampa Bay's 31-25 loss to the Eagles in Week 4, per Adam Schefter of ESPN, and he was spotted on crutches and in a walking boot at Wednesday's walk-through practice. It's a relief that the second-year pro has avoided a long-term injury, but it appears his status for Week 5 may come down to the wire. If Irving ends up missing any time, Rachaad White and Sean Tucker will be slated to lead the Buccaneers' backfield.
#### Chris Godwin Jr. (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Godwin made his season debut after completing his recovery from last October's ankle dislocation, and despite concerns he'd be eased into action, the veteran wideout finished tied for the team lead in targets with Emeka Egbuka. Godwin's inefficiency wasn't unexpected considering the coverage skills of the Eagles' secondary and his long layoff, but the immediate attention from Baker Mayfield was also warranted due to the absence of Mike Evans (hamstring). With Evans expected to miss multiple games, Godwin is likely to remain heavily involved in the passing attack in a Week 5 road trip to Seattle.
