## Player Report

#### Trey McBride (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** The talented tight end was on the receiving end of Kyler Murray's longest completion of the night, kickstarting Arizona's second drive. McBride, who signed a four-year, $76 million extension in April, is ticketed for another massive role again in 2025 after recording 111 receptions for 1,146 yards and two touchdowns across 16 regular-season contests last season.
#### Chuba Hubbard (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** The Panthers' lead back was out there with his first-unit mates for two series, but Hubbard was sparsely used. That was also the case in the preseason opener against the Browns, as keeping the versatile back healthy for Week 1 is clearly a top priority. Hubbard will share the backfield with Rico Dowdle this coming season, which will likely lead to at least a slight hit to the former's touches, but he should still be in line for a robust role as both runner and receiver.
#### Ja'Marr Chase (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Chase played just one drive Monday night, after catching four passes for 71 yards and a TD on two series in Cincinnati's preseason opener. He'll likely be held out of the final preseason game, ahead of a Week 1 contest at Cleveland against a defense led by DE Myles Garrett and CB Denzel Ward. Chase caught 11 of 14 targets for 152 yards and two TDs in his two matchups with Cleveland last season, after having just one big game against the Browns through his first three years in the league.
#### Dalton Schultz (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The move to restructure Schultz's 2025 pay from base salary into a signing bonus lowers the Texans' salary cap for this season, and the veteran tight end is still slated to make the $11 million he's owed in 2026. Schultz played in all 17 regular-season games in 2024 and finished with 53 catches (on 85 targets) for 532 yards and two touchdowns, all of which were his lowest since the 2019 campaign as a member of the Cowboys.
#### Josh Downs (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Downs has been dealing with a hamstring issue since Aug. 14, but it appears as though he's not too far away from returning to practice. With that in mind, the wideout is trending toward being ready for Week 1 action, in the absence of any setbacks.
#### Travis Etienne Jr. (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** All four of Etienne's touches came on Jacksonville's second drive after Tank Bigsby played the first drive, though both possessions featured the rest of the team's healthy starters, including quarterback Trevor Lawrence. Etienne and Bigsby appear headed for a timeshare in the regular season, though rookie fourth-round pick Bhayshul Tuten is pushing to crack that rotation and helped his case by scoring a second-quarter touchdown with the backups Sunday. Etienne's standing in the Jaguars' backfield competition is unlikely to change in the team's preseason finale against the Dolphins on Saturday.
#### Amari Cooper (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** On the same day reports surfaced that Jakobi Meyers is seeking  a trade, the Raiders move to bolster their wideout depth. Once Cooper is up to speed with the team's offense, he should have an immediate opportunity to make his mark in a pass-catching corps that otherwise features Meyers (for now, at least) and TE Brock Bowers. In six games with the Browns and eight with the Bills in 2024, the 31-year-old -- who the Raiders drafted fourth overall in 2015 -- combined to record a 44-547-4 line on 85 targets.
#### Matthew Stafford (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Stafford has practiced in full since his return to the field Aug. 18, so while him being named the Week 1 starter was expected, McVay hadn't actually communicated the decision until now. With game day now approaching, the 37-year-old quarterback could begin having a cap on his reps as a form of load management, but barring a tangible setback in his recovery from the back injury that caused him to miss most of training camp and the preseason, fantasy managers will be able to count on Stafford's presence under center, a notable development for Puka Nacua, Davante Adams and RB Kyren Williams. Per Stu Jackson of the Rams' official site, starting left tackle Alaric Jackson (tailbone/blood clots) also is expected to play Week 1.
#### Rhamondre Stevenson (RB)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Stevenson, who has been managing an unspecified injury that isn't viewed as significant, sported a non-contact jersey in his return to practice this week, per Andrew Callahan of the Boston Herald, but there's nothing to suggests that his Week 1 status is in any danger. Added clarity in that regard will arrive no later than the Patriots' first official injury/practice report, but as the coming season approaches Stevenson is set to reprise his key role in a backfield that also includes dynamic 2025 second-rounder TreVeyon Henderson, along with fellow returnee Antonio Gibson. Though Henderson remains the upside play from a fantasy standpoint and figures to cut into Stevenson's volume this season, there should be enough touches, in an offense that could lean toward the run, for both players to carry weekly fantasy lineup utility.
#### Spencer Rattler (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The NFL's last remaining preseason QB competition finally reached its conclusion, as Rattler beat out rookie second-round pick Tyler Shough. In seven games (six starts) as a 2024 fifth-rounder last season, Rattler completed 130 of 228 passes (57 percent) for 1,317 yards, four touchdowns and five interceptions, while adding 18 carries for 146 yards and fumbling five times (three lost). He'll be under center for the Saints on Sunday, Sept. 7 against the Cardinals, but Rattler likely won't have much job security.
#### A.J. Brown (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** The same applies to DeVonta Smith (groin), which paves the way for the Eagles' top two wideouts to be available for Week 1 action. Brown is coming off a 2024 regular season in which he recorded a 67-1,079-7 line on 97 targets in 13 contests and is in line to continue in his key role in a Philadelphia passing offense that runs largely through him, Smith and TE Dallas Goedert.
#### Brian Robinson Jr. (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Christian McCaffrey has remained healthy all summer, but nearly all of the 49ers' other running backs have missed time with injuries, including Isaac Guerendo (shoulder). Guerendo did return to practice earlier this week, but there's now risk he drops down the depth chart with San Francisco trading for Robinson, who has 40 starts and 22 TDs to his name in the NFL (including playoffs). The Commanders, meanwhile, are left with Austin Ekeler, Jacory Croskey-Merritt, Chris Rodriguez and Jeremy McNichols in the backfield. Washington reportedly will receive a sixth-round pick and eat some of Robinson's $3.4 million base salary, Mike Garafolo of NFL Network reports.
#### Sam Darnold (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Coach Mike Macdonald said rookie QB Jalen Milroe will start and play the entire contest. Darnold will next be seen in action Week 1, when the Seahawks host the rival 49ers.
#### Cooper Kupp (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Kupp made his official debut with the Seahawks after switching allegiances within the NFC West this past offseason. The veteran superstar had little to do in his one drive of action after Zach Charbonnet (5-45-1) stole the show on the ground. The end of Kupp's tenure with the Rams saw his production dwarfed by injury, with his last 1,000-yard season coming during his MVP run in 2021. The 32-year-old will look for a fresh start while starting opposite Jaxon Smith-Njigba and catching passes from Sam Darnold in 2025.
#### Jaxon Smith-Njigba (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Seattle's key starters on offense got to see the field for the first drive of Friday's exhibition before exiting with a clean bill of health. New starting QB Sam Darnold connected with Smith-Njigba for the first time as teammates for a short gain. With DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett joining different clubs this past offseason, Smith-Njigba will attempt to build off of last year's fantasy breakout as Seattle's undisputed No. 1 receiver in 2025.
