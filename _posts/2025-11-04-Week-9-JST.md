## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Emari Demercado (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Demercado used the Cardinals' bye week to fully recover from an ankle injury that wound up costing him just one contest. The 26-year-old jumped right into a prominent role, leading the backfield in production even though Bam Knight drew the start. Knight still saw plenty of involvement with 47 yards gained on 11 combined touches, but Demercado came out of the contest looking like the superior fantasy option. Trey Benson (knee) is eligible to be activated from injured reserve against the Seahawks in Week 10, but it's currently unclear if he'll be physically ready to play right away. Benson's eventual return should push Demercado back into a change-of-pace role, but the latter likely will maintain fantasy value until that happens.
</div>

### 🟢 Michael Penix Jr. (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Penix posted a new career high with three touchdown passes in his return from a one-game absence due to a knee injury. All three were thrown to Drake London, who returned from a one-game absence of his own due to a hip injury. They connected for a one-yard touchdown in the first quarter, a two-yard touchdown in the second and an eight-yard score in the third. Seventeen of Penix's 22 completions went to either London or Bijan Robinson. Penix will likely continue to lean heavily on those two playmakers in Week 10 against the Colts in Berlin.
</div>

### 🟡 D'Andre Swift (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 Rome Odunze (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Odunze had logged at least five targets in every prior game this season before being limited to three in Cincinnati. The receiver has 32 or fewer yards in three of the last four games. He remains a full-time starter with WR3 appeal, though this marked his first game without a reception in 2025.
</div>

### 🟢 Caleb Williams (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Williams' brimming stat line tells the tale of a wild afternoon at Paycor Stadium that featured seven lead changes. Williams had a hand in the decisive one, connecting with rookie tight end Colston Loveland for a 58-yard game-winning touchdown. That momentous play was preceded by 15- and five-yard scoring strikes to Olamide Zaccheaus and Loveland, respectively, as well as Williams' own two-yard TD grab from DJ Moore on a trick play to cap off Chicago's opening possession. The 2024 first overall pick snapped a two-game TD-pass drought with Sunday's performance, and he also hit the 280-yard mark for the second consecutive contest. Williams and the Bears have another favorable matchup on tap when the Giants pay a visit to Soldier Field for a Week 10 matchup next Sunday afternoon.
</div>

### 🟢 Travis Kelce (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Kelce finished right around the single-game averages of 4.6 receptions and 59.3 yards that he entered Sunday's contest with, highlighting the consistent production the aging superstar has provided in fantasy this season. The 35-year-old enters Kansas City's Week 10 bye with a solid 41-540-3 receiving line through nine starts, putting him on pace to finish with his first 1,000-yard campaign since 2022. It is worth noting that Kelce was evaluated for a concussion at halftime, but he was cleared for the second half and finished without any reported setbacks. Kelce and the Chiefs will attempt to get back into the win column in a road tilt against the Broncos on Nov. 16.
</div>

### 🟢 Hunter Henry (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Henry logged 51 of 68 snaps on offense in the contest, per Mike Reiss of ESPN.com, and on the heels of being targeted just once in Week 8, the tight end saw more typical volume Sunday. Overall, Henry has recorded a 29-368-4 receiving line on 43 targets through nine games, a rate of production that keeps him on the fantasy radar in most formats.
</div>

### 🟢 Chris Olave (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Olave was not the primary target for rookie quarterback Tyler Shough, who made his first career start Sunday after replacing previous QB1 Spencer Rattler at the end of the Week 8 loss to Tampa Bay. Instead, No.2 wide receiver Rashid Shaheed led the Saints with nine targets. Olave tied with tight end Juwan Johnson for the team's second-most targets, which represented a season low for the wideout. It didn't help that LA dominated New Orleans in time of possession 43:53-16:07. If the Saints' offense continues to struggle at this rate, Olave could be in store for another low output Week 10 versus division-rival Carolina.
</div>

### 🟢 Will Shipley (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Shipley appears to have slipped to third on the depth chart, as his eight offensive snaps were only half of those played by Tank Bigsby, who carried the ball nine times. Saquon Barkley exited with a groin injury at the end of the third quarter but believes he'll be good to go after the team's Week 9 bye. If Barkley does wind up missing time, Shipley should play a larger role than normal in Week 10 against the Packers but would likely still see fewer touches than Bigsby.
</div>

### 🟢 DeVonta Smith (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> With A.J. Brown (hamstring) sidelined, Smith led the Eagles in catches, targets and receiving yards, although he watched all four of Jalen Hurts' TD passes go to teammates. Philly gets a Week 9 bye, so Brown may not miss any further action, but the bigger issue for the defending champions might be the groin injury Saquon Barkley picked up in Sunday's win. Even if Barkley is healthy when the Eagles head to Green Bay in Week 10, Smith still sports an impressive 44-588-2 line on 55 targets through eight games as part of a surging passing attack.
</div>

### 🟢 DK Metcalf (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Steelers came away with a win primarily on the strength of their defense, and there was minimal impact by any pass catcher. That was particularly true of Metcalf, who matched his season-low with four targets and turned in by far his least productive game. Metcalf has been productive for fantasy purposes with five touchdowns in eight games, but he's also been held to 50 yards or fewer in half of his contests.
</div>

### 🟢 Christian McCaffrey (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> McCaffrey got wide open for a five-yard touchdown catch in the first quarter and powered in a three-yard touchdown run in the fourth. The star running back has produced multi-touchdown performances in two of his last three games, sandwiched around McCaffrey's worst outing of the season (68 scrimmage yards against Houston in Week 8). He has at least 107 scrimmage yards in all but one appearance this season. Backup Brian Robinson rushed for 53 yards on his five carries, including an 18-yard touchdown in the third quarter, but McCaffrey continues to operate in a workhorse role, averaging 25.4 touches per game heading into a Week 10 home game against the Rams.
</div>

### 🟢 Rachaad White (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> White got another start in place of injured starter Bucky Irving (foot/shoulder) in Week 8, leading the Buccaneers' backfield in carries (13) and touches (15) in a comfortable win. That's where the good news ends, as backfield mate Sean Tucker (12-42-1) finished as the team's leading rusher while scoring its only touchdown on offense Sunday. With the Buccaneers on a bye in Week 9, there is a possibility that Irving could be ready to return when Tampa Bay resumes play against New England on Nov. 9. White would lose nearly all of his fantasy value in that scenario, so managers have to weigh whether it is worth holding on to the backup through the bye week.
</div>

### 🟢 Elic Ayomanor (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Ayomanor turned in a modest stat line, though he led the team in targets and yards. He nearly broke free for a touchdown on a 29-yard catch over the middle of the field to begin the third quarter, but it was still the second-longest catch of his rookie season. Ayomanor has topped 45 yards in each of his last two games after achieving that mark just once in his first seven contests.
