## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Rico Dowdle (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The yardage total was Dowdle's lowest since he took on a significant role in the Panthers' backfield in Week 5, but he did score his fifth rushing TD of the season on a five-yard dash in the first quarter for the team's only score. Over his last six games, Dowdle has piled up 705 rushing yards and four touchdowns while adding a 13-122-1 receiving line on 17 targets. He'll look to staying productive in Week 11 against the Falcons.
</div>

### 🟢 Bryce Young (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The third-year QB failed to produce a touchdown for the second straight game, while extending his streak of games with under 200 passing yards to seven. Young remains a desperation play in most fantasy formats given his limited ceiling heading into a Week 11 trip to Atlanta.
</div>

### 🟢 Chase Brown (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The wild back-and-forth nature of the game limited Brown's rushing opportunities against a vulnerable Bears run defense, but the third-year back made up for it with his work as a receiver. Brown's catch and target totals were both team and season highs, and he did manage to log double-digit carries for the third straight contest. Brown will face the Steelers' inconsistent run defense on the road when the Bengals return from their Week 10 bye on Sunday, Nov. 16.
</div>

### 🟢 Jerry Jeudy (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> After a forgettable first half of the season, the mercurial wide receiver put forth an encouraging performance coming out of Cleveland's Week 9 bye. Jeudy scored his first touchdown of the season on a 22-yard catch in the second quarter. His 66 receiving yards at halftime matched Jeudy's full-game season high. Jeudy tacked on only 12 yards in the second half but finished with game-high totals in targets, catches and receiving yards. Given the lack of proven alternatives in Cleveland's wide receiver room, Jeudy should continue to command significant volume in Week 11 against the Ravens.
</div>

### 🟢 Dak Prescott (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Prescott took just two sacks against the Broncos in Week 8 but was pressured quite often in the loss, and the Cardinals then were much more successful getting home Monday night while racking up five sacks. The porous protection was particularly disappointing considering center Cooper Beebe returned from an ankle injury to anchor the Cowboys' offensive line, although Prescott was at least able to bounce back from the season-low-tying 188 yards he'd thrown for against Denver. The veteran signal-caller's one touchdown toss went to Ryan Flournoy from five yards out early in the fourth quarter, and Prescott's rushing yardage total qualified as a new season high. Prescott and his teammates will now have a Week 10 bye to regroup before returning to action with a Week 11 road matchup against the Raiders on Monday night, Nov. 17.
</div>

### 🟢 CeeDee Lamb (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Lamb led the Cowboys across the board in receptions, receiving yards and targets while also contributing a team-high 33-yard reception. The overall numbers were certainly solid from a fantasy perspective, but they came in a disappointing home loss that dropped the Cowboys to two games under .500. Lamb has back-to-back seven-catch tallies and no fewer than 74 receiving yards in any non-injury-shortened game this season, and he'll draw a highly favorable matchup coming out of Dallas' Week 10 bye when the Cowboys face the Raiders on the road on Monday night, Nov. 17.
</div>

### 🟢 RJ Harvey (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Harvey's veteran backfield mate J.K. Dobbins appeared to be examined by trainers on the sideline at one point, but the rookie still logged very modest action from scrimmage. After breaking out with a 7-46-2 rushing line in Week 8 against the Cowboys, Harvey has logged only six combined carries for 15 yards over the subsequent pair of contests, although he did tally five receptions for 51 yards and a touchdown in the Week 9 win over the Texans. Nevertheless, Dobbins remains the unquestioned lead back as long as he's healthy, meaning Harvey is likely to remain in a clear complementary role for a Week 11 home showdown against the Chiefs on Sunday, Nov. 16.
</div>

### 🟢 Luke Musgrave (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> In the first game since Tucker Kraft (IR, knee) was lost for the season, Musgrave still put together a modest performance. The Packers were also down Matthew Golden (shoulder) and saw Romeo Doubs (chest) exit in the fourth quarter, but Musgrave still finished with fewer yards than in Week 9 against the Panthers (34 yards) on the same number of receptions. The Packers' typically lower-volume passing game and Jordan Love's propensity for spreading the ball around leave Musgrave's fantasy outlook muted even in a favorable Week 11 road matchup against the Giants.
</div>

### 🟢 Xavier Worthy (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Worthy tied Rashee Rice for the team lead in targets Sunday, but that's about where the good news ends. The 22-year-old Worthy couldn't turn those opportunities into production, finishing fourth in receiving despite garnering such a large share of targets. The speedy gadget receiver is still providing a decent floor for fantasy in his current role, but we haven't seen him explode for a notable performance yet. Perhaps Worthy can finally rip off a long score when the Chiefs return from the upcoming bye to face the Broncos in Week 11.
</div>

### 🟢 Patrick Mahomes (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Mahomes picked a poor time to have his worst passing performance of the season after being outshined by rival Josh Allen (123.2 QB rating) in a loss that reshaped the landscape atop the AFC. It was Mahomes' first contest in 2025 in which he failed to register a touchdown, and also the first time he finished with a completion rate below 50 percent. Even with Sunday's dud, the 29-year-old heads into the upcoming bye week completing 65 percent of his passes for 2,349 passing yards and 21 total touchdowns through nine starts. Fantasy managers will have to search for a replacement signal-caller in Week 10 before Mahomes returns to action against Denver on Nov. 16.
</div>

### 🟢 Blake Corum (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Corum received double-digit touches for the third game in a row as the Rams' offense continued to toy with opposing defenses. Kyren Williams (14-73-2) still led the Rams' backfield in production while maintaining his elite fantasy status, but Corum has quietly carved out a consistent change-of-pace role during Los Angeles' hot stretch of play. With just one touchdown over nine appearances, the talented backup's recent increase in playing time only benefits those in deeper formats for next Sunday's tilt against the Seahawks.
</div>

### 🟡 TreVeyon Henderson (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Henderson appeared to get his knee twisted up during Sunday's 28-23 win at Tampa Bay, but he continued onward and authored the first signature performance of his career with 14 carries for 147 yards and two touchdowns to go with one catch (on one target) for three yards. He was getting a second straight spot start in place of Rhamondre Stevenson (toe), but the latter also was listed as limited Monday -- in addition to Terrell Jennings (knee) -- meaning all three players at the position on New England's active roster are banged up ahead of Thursday's game against the Jets.
</div>

### 🟢 Tyrone Tracy Jr. (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Neither Tracy nor Devin Singletary found any running room in the first half, but Tracy was far more effective on the ground in the second half, while Singletary finished the game with just eight carries for 20 yards. Quarterback Jaxson Dart carried the offense prior to departing due to a concussion to end the third quarter. If the Giants are forced to turn to Russell Wilson under center in Week 11, the entire offense's ceiling would be lower against a stout Packers defense, though Tracy's arrow is pointing up with the backfield workload distribution shifting in his favor.
</div>

### 🟢 Mason Taylor (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The only other Jets player with multiple targets in the game was Garrett Wilson (knee), who had three targets prior to exiting Sunday's win. Taylor has had an inconsistent rookie season, seeing two or fewer targets on four occasions and five or more targets five times. Given the Jets' lack of talent at wide receiver, Taylor could see a bump in volume if the Jets fall behind and pass more against the Patriots in Week 11.
</div>

### 🔴 Brandon Aiyuk (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Out<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Aiyuk remains in the rehab stages of the torn ACL and MCL that he suffered in his right knee Week 7 of last season. Shanahan told David Lombardi of SFStandard.com last Wednesday that he's "pretty confident" Aiyuk will play at some point this season, but it's unlikely to happen this coming Sunday and probably for at least a few more weeks after that point.
</div>

### 🔴 Bucky Irving (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Doubtful<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Bowles indicated that Irving's shoulder is what's holding him back right now, saying Monday that Irving has to be able to take a hit to the shoulder before he returns to game action. It sounds as if the Bucs again will lean on the tandem of Rachaad White and Sean Tucker next Sunday versus Buffalo's subpar run defense. Fantasy players need to plan for yet another Irving absence, and it would mark his sixth consecutive missed contest if he's ultimately unable to play against the Bills.
