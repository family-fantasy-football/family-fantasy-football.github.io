## Player Report

#### Tyler Allgeier (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Bijan Robinson had a massive day with 21 touches, a career-high 181 scrimmage yards and a rushing TD of his own, but Allgeier still made an impact with a 15-yard score late in the third quarter. It was the fourth-year RB's second touchdown of the season, and despite his backup role he's been able to carve out some fantasy value behind Robinson, turning 41 carries through four weeks into 155 rushing yards. The Falcons will be on bye in Week 5, but Allgeier's volume in Week 6 could depend on whether the team can keep things close against the Bills.
#### Troy Franklin (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Franklin rebounded from last week's stinker (2-8-0) with his second-highest yardage total through four games. The 22-year-old's eight targets paced Denver's receiving corps, but drops were an issue after finishing with a 50 percent catch rate. Franklin has flashed upside with a 18-196-1 line as a second-year pro, but his Week 5 fantasy value should be limited to deeper formats against the Eagles on Sunday.
#### Evan Engram (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** A back issue prevented Engram from practicing and playing in Week 3, but following full practices both Thursday and Friday, the tight end is poised to return to action Monday night against the Bengals. With just four catches (on six targets) for 33 yards in his first two games with the Broncos, the early returns on Engram aren't great, but assuming his back injury is no longer an issue, he's a player capable of picking up the pace, as soon as Monday. With that in mind, Zac Stevens of TheDNVR.com relays that Engram indicated Friday that he feels "great" ahead of Week 4 action, while, for his part, offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi told Stevens that he believes Engram will "be getting going here real soon."
#### Joe Mixon (RB)
**Injury Status:** Out <br>
**Lineup Slot:** IR <br>
**Details:** The veteran back can be activated as soon as Week 5, but Texans head coach DeMeco Ryans was asked twice during Monday's session with reporters and declined to provide any kind of estimated return date for Mixon, per Jonathan M. Alexander of the Houston Chronicle. While there's no official word, it doesn't appear he is close to returning. In the meantime, Woody Marks, fresh off a breakout performance in Week 4, and Nick Chubb will continue to share the bulk of the backfield work.
#### Brian Thomas Jr. (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Thomas finished as the Jaguars' leading receiver in another low-volume passing day from Trevor Lawrence (21-for-31, 174 yards, one TD). The 22-year-old wideout gained seven yards on his second rushing attempt of the season, but he was unable to reproduce the trip to the end zone from his first attempt back in Week 1. The positive takeaway from this matchup was Thomas posting his first catch rate north of 50 percent (71.4) after suffering a bad case of the drops over his previous three contests. Thomas will attempt to carry over the confidence from this solid showing into next Monday's primetime matchup against Kansas City.
#### Isiah Pacheco (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Kareem Hunt saw more volume in the game with 14 touches, though he averaged an abysmal 2.6 yards per attempt and played 32 snaps on offense to Pacheco's 27. Pacheco was more efficient, logging a long run of 12 yards while also finding the end zone for the first time in 2025 with an eight-yard touchdown catch late in the second quarter. Pacheco will be difficult to trust so long as he's splitting opportunities with Hunt, but he's showcased improved efficiency and volume in the last two games.
#### Ladd McConkey (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Justin Herbert had his worst game of the season to date, but Quentin Johnston (8-98-1 on 13 targets) still put together a strong performance while Keenan Allen (5-37-0 on seven targets) maintained a solid floor. McConkey, on the other hand, failed to catch multiple passes in a game for the first time in his career. The 2024 second-round pick showed too much chemistry with Herbert as a rookie to think he's suddenly going to disappear from the Chargers' game plan, but McConkey will be tough to have active in most fantasy formats until he begins to show the same kind of spark he did last year. He'll look to begin a breakout Week 5 against the Commanders.
#### De'Von Achane (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Achane rattled off several chunk gains against the Jets defense, particularly on a key fourth-quarter drive as the Dolphins looked to ice their first victory of the season. The speedy third-year back's carry and yardage totals were both season-high figures, as the combination of Tyreek Hill's early exit due to a gruesome knee injury and a game script favorable to the ground game helped Achane's cause. With Hill presumably sidelined the rest of the season, Achane will be looked at to provide some of the explosive component lost by the wide receiver's absence, especially since the former is also a very capable pass catcher. Achane draws a highly favorable matchup Week 5, as the Dolphins travel to Carolina to face the Panthers.
#### Wan'Dale Robinson (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** The five targets tied for the team lead with tight end Theo Johnson, but it was still disappointing volume for Robinson in Jaxson Dart's first career NFL start under center, especially considering that Malik Nabers (knee) was knocked out of the game in the second quarter. Nabers could have a torn ACL which would sideline him for the remainder of 2025, a brutal blow to the Giants offense that would leave Robinson and Darius Slayton atop the depth chart at WR. Robinson will take an 18-237-1 line on 27 targets into a Week 5 clash with the Saints, but the bulk of that production came Week 2 with Russell Wilson at the helm of the offense.
#### Darius Slayton (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** While the volume and production were modest, Slayton wound up leading the Giants in receptions and receiving yards in Jaxson Dart's first career start at QB, as Malik Nabers (knee) was knocked out of the game in the second quarter. Nabers' injury is feared to be a torn ACL which would end his season, a development that would make Slayton the team's top downfield option, albeit in arguably the weakest wide receiver group in the league. The veteran WR will take a 9-135-0 line on 13 targets into a Week 5 contest against the Saints.
#### Aaron Rodgers (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** The Steelers played from ahead for most of the game, so Rodgers attempted only eight passes in the second half. He managed to move the offense efficiently when asked, however, with the key to his day being an explosive 80-yard touchdown to DK Metcalf early in the second quarter. This was a return to form for Rodgers, as he had only a 3:3 TD:INT while combining to throw for 332 yards across his last two games. Pittsburgh is likely to continue to rely on its run game and short passes to move the offense, which will lead to inconsistent fantasy results for Rodgers.
#### Mike Evans (WR)
**Injury Status:** Out <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** out
#### Baker Mayfield (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Mayfield got limited throwing work in practice this week due to a biceps issue, but he still mustered his best passing yardage total of 2025, thanks in large part to 77- and 72-yard touchdown passes to Emeka Egbuka and Bucky Irving, respectively. Considering he was playing without Mike Evans (hamstring) and that Chris Godwin was making his season debut, Mayfield's numbers have to be considered encouraging. He'll aim to get the Bucs right back into the win column during a tough Week 5 road matchup against the Seahawks next Sunday afternoon.
#### Tyler Lockett (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** There were some positives to take away from the performance, as Lockett logged a season-high 74 percent of offensive snaps and drew four targets for the second consecutive game. However, he was unable to connect with Cam Ward, who has struggled in his first four starts as a pro. Like nearly every Titans' pass catcher, Lockett is an unreliable fantasy option.
#### Jayden Daniels (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Daniels will return from his two-game absence due to a knee sprain and start Sunday's road matchup against the Chargers. It appeared as though the second-year signal-caller had at least a chance to return Week 4 versus Atlanta, so by this stage there should be minimal, if any, lingering concerns about Daniels' mobility and rushing upside. Meanwhile, Quinn also said things are "trending up" for wideouts Terry McLaurin (quadriceps) and Noah Brown (groin), per Nicki Jhabvala of The Washington Post.
