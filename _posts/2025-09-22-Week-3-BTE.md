## Player Report

#### Dalton Kincaid (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Kincaid led the Bills in receptions, receiving yards and targets on the night, rounding out his productive performance with a 20-yard outstretched touchdown grab in the first quarter that answered Miami's early score. The athletic tight end has arguably been Buffalo's most consistent game-to-game pass catcher for fantasy purposes through the first three games, as he'll take a 13-151-2 line on 16 targets into a Week 4 home matchup against the Saints on Sunday, Sept. 28.
#### DJ Moore (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Moore continued to be overshadowed by Rome Odunze, but he also lost out to Luther Burden in the blowout win. Moore still finished second on the team in targets, but his longest gain went for only 12 yards as he was targeted exclusively in short areas of the field. He saved his day with a four-yard touchdown catch late in the fourth quarter, his first trip to the end zone this season. Nevertheless, Moore has yet to see more than six targets in a game and has topped 50 receiving yards only once in three contests.
#### Tee Higgins (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Higgins barely saw Jake Browning look his way, as he logged more targets than only Cam Grandy and Mitchell Tinsley. The valued No. 2 wideout's muted performance was naturally part of a miserable day for the Bengals' offense overall, but better days should be ahead for both Browning and Higgins the more the former settles in under center. However, another tough matchup awaits in Week 4, when Cincinnati travels west to face the Broncos on Monday night, Sept. 29.
#### Jake Browning (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** The Vikings jumped on Browning and the Bengals early, establishing a 14-0 lead through one quarter, and the veteran backup was never able to get his side of the ball fully on track. Browning ultimately took three sacks and tossed a pair of picks in Minnesota territory, the first of which was a pick-six in the first quarter. Browning has demonstrated the ability to play appreciably better than he demonstrated Sunday in a game that got out of hand due largely to turnovers, but atoning for the poor performance in Week 4 could be a heavy lift with a road trip to Denver for a Monday night, Sept. 29 date with the Broncos on tap.
#### Jerome Ford (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Ford didn't get a carry for the first time in three weeks, but he has emerged as a primary target out of the backfield. He actually caught a fifth pass, but the play was negated by a holding penalty. Ford has 10 official targets over the last two weeks and 11 for the season. That's tied with Dylan Sampson for the lead among Cleveland's running backs, but Sampson went untargeted Sunday and has just three over the last two weeks. Ford was not used in the return game after returning six kicks in Week 2.
#### Christian Kirk (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Making his season/team debut, Kirk finished tied for third in receptions on another relatively difficult day for the Texans' passing game. The veteran wideout was projected to serve as an effective short-to-mid-range complement to Nico Collins coming into the season, and now that Kirk is finally healthy, he'll have a chance to start building chemistry with C.J. Stroud on an ongoing basis and likely provide Houston's struggling air attack with a boost. Kirk next takes aim at the Titans' inconsistent defense in a Week 4 home matchup.
#### C.J. Stroud (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Another sluggish day for the Texans offense saw Stroud toss his second and third interceptions of the season on the Jaguars' 19 and four-yard line, respectively, in the second half. The second pick was a true back-breaker, as it came with 27 seconds remaining and Houston seemingly on the verge of going in for a game-tying touchdown. Stroud and his teammates on that side of the ball have looked out of sorts through three games, albeit against the tough defenses of the Rams, Buccaneers and Jaguars. Stroud will look to rebound in a Week 4 home matchup against the vulnerable Titans defense.
#### J.J. McCarthy (QB)
**Injury Status:** Out <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** inactive
#### Juwan Johnson (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Johnson continued his early-season surge with another strong PPR effort despite his team suffering yet another loss. The veteran starter has been an early surprise in fantasy, racking up 19 receptions on 29 targets for 176 yards and a touchdown through three contests. Johnson has quickly become a must-start option at such a shallow fantasy position heading into next Sunday's road tilt against the Bills.
#### Breece Hall (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** The fourth-year RB posted disappointing numbers for the second straight week as Hall drifted closer to a full timeshare with Braelon Allen, seeing 13 touches to the younger back's eight and barely out-producing him (52 yards to 47). Hall is still looking for his first TD of 2025, and through three contests he's averaging 4.1 yards per carry on 38 totes. He'll try to break out in Week 4 against a Dolphins defense that just got gashed for 108 yards and a touchdown by the Bills' James Cook.
#### Dallas Goedert (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Goedert returned from a one-game absence and was the odd-man out on a strong offensive day for the Eagles. He did manage to make his lone reception of the day count by hauling in a 33-yard touchdown early in the third quarter as he split the Rams' defense down the middle of the field. Though it's come in very different ways, Goedert has had a productive start to the season after tallying seven catches in Week 1.
#### Kenneth Walker III (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Walker punched in a pair of short touchdowns early on to help build a 38-6 lead over the Saints at halftime. The 24-year-old has bounced back nicely from a Week 1 dud against San Francisco (10-20-0), generating 143 rushing yards and three touchdowns in the two starts since. The Seahawks were without the services of RB Zach Charbonnet (foot) on Sunday, and a similar situation could unfold in Week 4 with a short practice week on tap ahead of Thursday Night Football. Walker would still generate flex value if Charbonnet is able to suit up against Arizona, but the former would see a huge boost in fantasy value if his backfield mate remains sidelined.
#### Zach Charbonnet (RB)
**Injury Status:** Out <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Given that Charbonnet didn't practice this week due to a foot injury that left him doubtful to suit up Week 3, his lack of availability doesn't come as a surprise. The Seahawks have a short turnaround Week 4 with a visit to the Cardinals on tap Thursday, so there's a chance he's in line for a multi-game absence. In the meantime, Kenneth Walker is set to be a workhorse out of Seattle's backfield, while George Holani and undrafted rookie Jacardia Wright are the options behind him.
#### Terry McLaurin (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Prior to the Commanders deeming him questionable to return early in the fourth quarter, McLaurin had three catches (on four targets) for 74 yards, including a team-high 56-yard connection with fill-in starting QB Marcus Mariota. With Noah Brown (groin) inactive, Deebo Samuel, Jaylin Lane, Luke McCaffrey and Chris Moore are Washington's healthy and available wide receivers.
