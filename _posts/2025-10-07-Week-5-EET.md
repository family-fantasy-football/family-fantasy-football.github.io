## Player Report

#### Drake London (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The fourth-year wideout didn't reach 60 receiving yards or find the end zone in the first three weeks of the season, but London broke out in Week 4, highlighting his performance with a five-yard TD reception from Michael Penix in the first quarter. London led the Falcons in targets -- no one else got more than five -- as well as catches and receiving yards, and he remains the unquestioned top option in the team's passing game headed into a Week 5 bye, ahead of a tough Week 6 battle against the Bills.
#### Justice Hill (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Though the Ravens were in a catch-up script for much of the game, Hill played his fewest snaps of the season by a wide margin. The veteran had played at least 40% of the snaps in the first four weeks before bottoming out with 30% on Sunday. Opportunities dried up as a result as he had just one carry and two targets on the day. Baltimore's offense is in a tough spot as long as Lamar Jackson is sidelined and the ripple effects fall across the skill players, including Hill. The Ravens host the Rams in Week 6
#### Joshua Palmer (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Palmer was held to a 23-yard catch in the the second quarter for much of the game before hauling in a 13-yard grab on the last play of regulation. He was on the field for 35 of 68 offensive snaps (51.5 percent), which was third most among Bills wide receivers behind Khalil Shakir (43) and Keon Coleman (42). Palmer saw nine targets in his Bills debut Week 1 against the Ravens, but he has seen three looks or less from Josh Allen in each of the four games since. The lack of targets makes Palmer hard to count on from a fantasy perspective heading into Buffalo's Week 6 road contest against Atlanta on Monday, Oct. 13.
#### Courtland Sutton (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Sutton led the Broncos in receptions, receiving yards and targets on the afternoon, recording a team-high 34-yard catch along the way. The veteran wideout fell just short of what would have been his second 100-yard game of the campaign, but he's now posted at least 81 receiving yards in three straight contests. Sutton figures to remain Bo Nix's top target when the Broncos travel to London to face the Jets in a Week 6 clash next Sunday.
#### Trevor Lawrence (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Lawrence put the Jaguars on his shoulders for the majority of the night despite a critical early second-quarter fumble at Kansas City's one-yard line, helping spearhead a comeback from an early 14-0 deficit with a three-yard touchdown pass to Parker Washington and the first of two rushing scores to knot the game back up just before the halfway point of the third quarter. Lawrence then saved his best for the most important part of the contest, leading a seven-play, 60-yard game-winning march that he capped off with an eventful one-yard touchdown run that began with him stumbling twice due to having his foot stepped on by an offensive lineman as he dropped back. Lawrence still is a work in progress in head coach Liam Coen's offense, but he completed a season-best 72.0 percent of his passes Monday night ahead of a Week 6 home matchup against a Seahawks defense that allowed the Buccaneers' Baker Mayfield to complete 29 of 33 passes for 379 yards and two TDs in Seattle's Week 5 loss.
#### Hollywood Brown (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Brown tied for second on the Chiefs in targets while checking in third in both receptions and receiving yards. The busy night for the veteran wideout was par for the course thus far this season, as Brown has no fewer than five targets in any of his first five contests.  Brown also recorded his first catch of at least 20 yards since Week 1 on Monday night, and he'll continue to profile as a key target for Patrick Mahomes in a Week 6 Sunday night showdown at home against the Lions.
#### Jakobi Meyers (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** With Brock Bowers (knee) unavailable, the expectation was that Meyers would be even busier than usual in his role as the Raiders' No. 1 receiver. However, all of Tre Tucker, Ashton Jeanty and even practice squad call-up Albert Okwuegbunam outpaced Meyers in receptions, receiving yards or both. After opening the season in typically productive fashion with a 17-228-0 line on 26 targets over his first three games, Meyers has slumped to an 8-62-0 tally on 13 targets over the last pair of contests. The veteran will have a good opportunity to bounce back in Week 6, however, as a suspect Titans defense comes to Las Vegas next Sunday afternoon.
#### Rashid Shaheed (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Most of that production came on a single play -- an 87-yard catch-and-run in the second quarter that Shaheed took to the house. The fourth-year wideout hadn't exceeded 52 receiving yards in a game this year prior to Sunday, and second-year QB Spencer Rattler may not be able to find his deep threat so easily against more competent secondaries, but it was still an encouraging sign for Shaheed and the Saints' aerial attack. He'll look for another big play or two in Week 6 against the Patriots.
#### Saquon Barkley (RB)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Barkley was notably listed as a non-participant on Monday's practice estimate, but Rapoport's report suggests that the star back isn't in danger of being sidelined Thursday. That said, Barkley's status still is worth monitoring ahead of Week 6 action, with added context on that front slated to arrive via Tuesday's practice report.
#### Brock Purdy (QB)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** questionable
#### George Kittle (TE)
**Injury Status:** Injured Reserve <br>
**Lineup Slot:** IR <br>
**Details:** After missing the requisite four games upon being placed on IR following Week 1 action, Kittle will be eligible for activation during the upcoming week, but he seemingly hasn't made enough progress in his recovery from a hamstring injury to put himself in consideration for a return just yet. The 49ers could still elect to open Kittle's 21-day practice window next week, though Shanahan hinted that the team may prefer to wait until Week 7 before having the 31-year-old get back on the field, per Matt Barrows of The Athletic. While Kittle has been out for the past four weeks, the 49ers have had Jake Tonges and Luke Farrell share snaps at tight end, with the former player proving to be the more formidable pass-catching threat.
#### Tony Pollard (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** It was an eventful day for Pollard with significant swings in performance. He picked up 26 yards on four carries on the Titans' opening drive, but his next notable contribution to the game was losing a fumble that set up an Arizona touchdown. Pollard then redeemed himself with a one-yard score of his own early in the fourth quarter to kickstart a frantic Tennessee comeback that resulted in the team's first win of the season. Also notable was that Pollard out-touched Tyjae Spears 17-4, though Spears is likely to become more involved in future matchups. Pollard has done an admirable job early in the campaign given the state of Tennessee's offense, picking up at least 60 yards on the ground in four of five games.
#### Zach Ertz (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Despite Jayden Daniels returning from a knee injury in Week 5, Ertz had his worst game of the season. He was targeted just once and didn't appear to be a part of the Commanders' offensive game plan. Ertz still logged 30 offensive snaps and operated as Washington's No. 1 tight end, playing ahead of John Bates (28 snaps) and Ben Sinnott (17 snaps). With both Terry McLaurin (quadriceps) and Noah Brown (groin/knee) sidelined Sunday, Ertz was expected to serve as one of the Commanders' primary receiving threats but failed to capitalize. He's likely to operate as Washington's top tight end again in the Week 6 matchup against the Bears.
