## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Rico Dowdle (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The fifth-year running back split touches nearly equally with Chuba Hubbard, but it was Hubbard who paced Carolina's backfield with 124 scrimmage yards, including a 35-yard TD reception from Bryce Young in the first quarter. Dowdle has gone three straight games without getting into the end zone himself, producing 141 rushing yards on only 3.3 yards per carry during that stretch, and Hubbard could be re-emerging as the Panthers' top RB. The team will be on bye next week, so clarity in the backfield pecking order likely won't come until a Week 15 clash with the Saints.
</div>

### 🟢 Bryce Young (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The third-year quarterback came up with a heroic effort in the upset win, with two of his TD passes -- a 33-yard strike to Jalen Coker in the third quarter and a 43-yard connection with Tetairoa McMillan in the fourth for the go-ahead score -- coming on fourth-down plays. It's the third three-touchdown performance of the season for Young, and second in the last three games as he finally begins to show signs of emerging as a franchise player for the Panthers. Young will get a well-deserved rest during Carolina's bye next week before facing the Saints in Week 15.
</div>

### 🟢 Chase Brown (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Brown had a seemingly tantalizing matchup coming into the afternoon against what had been a vulnerable Bills front seven, but the third-year back was consistently shut down on the ground outside of a five-yard touchdown run with just under seven minutes remaining in the first quarter. Brown was less productive than usual as a receiver as well, considering his yardage total in that capacity was his lowest since Week 7, but he was able to record an impressive 10-yard contested TD grab with just over three minutes remaining in the first half. Brown's first opportunity to bounce back with more production yardage-wise come in a Week 15 home rematch against a Ravens team he posted 113 total yards against in a Thanksgiving Night win.
</div>

### 🟡 CeeDee Lamb (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> With added recovery time ahead of Week 15, Lamb is trending in the right direction as Sunday's game against the Vikings approaches. The star wideout's progress through the concussion protocol will begin to come into focus when the team's next official injury report is posted Wednesday.
</div>

### 🟢 Dak Prescott (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Prescott lost CeeDee Lamb to a concussion early in the third quarter, but that didn't deter the standout signal-caller from a season-high yardage total on his way to his third straight 300-yard game. Game script also worked toward supporting a heavy-volume night for Prescott, whose number of pass attempts was his second highest of the season. Prescott connected with eight different targets overall, and Ryan Flournoy (42 yards) and Jake Ferguson were on the receiving end of his one touchdown pass and two-point conversion toss, respectively. Prescott and his teammates will continue their quest to eventually punch a postseason ticket in a Week 15 Sunday night home clash against the Vikings on Dec. 14.
</div>

### 🟢 Troy Franklin (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Franklin continued starting opposite Courtland Sutton (6-62-0), but the former appears to have fallen out of favor after finishing in a tie with Pat Bryant (4-32-0) for third in team targets. The 22-year-old Franklin is averaging 2.5 receptions and 11.0 yards in the two games coming out of Denver's Week 12 bye. Franklin's volatility on a week-to-week basis makes the wideout hard to trust outside of deeper fantasy formats against the Packers next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 RJ Harvey (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Harvey continued his recent success as Denver's lead back with a return trip to the end zone after scoring twice on the ground in Week 13. The second-round rookie took full advantage of the soft defensive matchup by cracking the century mark in yards from scrimmage for the first time in his promising career. Harvey made his mark primarily as a receiving back earlier this season, but he is getting an opportunity to flash his all-around game with J.K. Dobbins (foot) on injured reserve. Harvey should be viewed as a starting option in standard fantasy formats for next Sunday's tilt against the Packers.
</div>

### 🟢 Brenton Strange (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Strange tied for second on the team with six targets, though he had little to show for it. His longest gain went for 16 yards on a reception late in the first quarter, and he also came up just short of the end zone on the Jaguars' first offensive possession while being targeted inside the 10. Strange has at least four targets in all three of his games since returning from injury, though this was his lowest yardage total in that span.
</div>

### 🟢 Xavier Worthy (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Worthy finished as the Chiefs' leading receiver despite ranking third in targets behind TE Travis Kelce and WR Rashee Rice. The 22-year-old Worthy was the only starter to generate any kind of a downfield threat against Houston's stout defense. The versatile wideout did not record a rushing attempt for the third time over his last four appearances. He has, however, eclipsed 50 receiving yards in three consecutive contests, providing a solid floor for fantasy managers in deeper formats. Worthy's upside lies in his ability to rip off huge gains, and the same could be said for next Sunday's tilt against the Chargers.
</div>

### 🟢 Patrick Mahomes (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Mahomes was shut down almost completely by the Texans' vaunted defense on Sunday Night Football, a scene we have not seen much over the course of the signal-caller's illustrious career. All credit goes to Houston's defense, but Kansas City's role players didn't offer much relief. The Chiefs' receivers suffered six drops in the primetime loss, with notable guffaws coming in critical moments from stars Rashee Rice and Travis Kelce. Mahomes may have to pull out one of his Superman games against the Chargers in order to keep his team's bleak playoff hopes alive in Week 15.
</div>

### 🟢 Stefon Diggs (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Despite Drake Maye throwing for 282 yards on 24 completions, Diggs was once again a minor player in the air attack. The veteran wideout has 46 yards or fewer in five of his last six games, including back-to-back sub-30-yard tallies. Nevertheless, Diggs has the ability to resurface in a passing game that spreads the wealth around to different targets on a weekly basis, and such an instance could come in a Week 15 matchup against his old Bills teammates on Sunday, Dec. 14 following a Week 14 bye.
</div>

### 🟢 TreVeyon Henderson (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Henderson actually logged one fewer carry than Rhamondre Stevenson, but he outgained his backfield mate by 27 rushing yards and drew one additional target as well. Both backs had ample opportunity thanks to game script, as the Patriots already held a 30-7 lead at halftime. Henderson is still likely the No. 1 option under normal circumstances, but both backs are clearly trusted by the coaching staff. Henderson next takes aim at the Bills' typically generous run defense in a Week 15 home showdown on Sunday, Dec. 14 following a Week 14 bye.
</div>

### 🟡 Tyrone Tracy Jr. (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Tracy endured a hard hit in the fourth quarter and couldn't much weight on his left leg as he was assisted to the sideline. He then was carted to the locker room before the Giants deemed him questionable to return. That marked the end of Tracy's night, leaving him with 10 carries for 36 yards and one catch (on one target) for minus-3 yards. Meanwhile, fellow RB Devin Singletary had his most-productive outing of the season with 15 touches for 102 yards from scrimmage and one TD. New York has a Week 14 bye on tap, which may afford Tracy enough time to get back to 100 percent. In the end, though, both Tracy and Singletary have regular roles in the offense and likely need the other to cede snaps to truly provide consistent results on game days.
</div>

### 🟢 Mason Taylor (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Taylor led the Jets in catches and receiving yards while tying John Metchie for the team lead in targets. Rookie quarterback Brady Cook showed a nice connection with Taylor after replacing the injured Tyrod Taylor (groin) in the first half, so the rookie tight end's fantasy outlook is unlikely to be significantly impacted regardless of whether Cook, Tyrod or Justin Fields (knee) starts at quarterback in Week 15 against a Jaguars defense that has struggled to defend tight ends.
</div>

### 🟢 Sean Tucker (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Tucker was third in rush attempts behind Bucky Irving (15 carries) and Rachaad White (11 carries), but the third-year back was the only one of the three to get into the end zone on the ground via a one-yard run just before the midway point of the third quarter. Tucker's boost in playing time and opportunity was encouraging, considering he'd been held to no gain on just two rush attempts against the Cardinals in Week 13. Tucker will aim to maximize whatever touches he sees in a favorable Week 15 home matchup against the Falcons on Thursday night.
</div>

### 🟢 Bucky Irving (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Irving had elevated expectations heading into the divisional matchup given some of the Saints' troubles defending the run this season, but New Orleans did a reasonably effective job while limiting him to a stingy 23 yards on the 14 carries he logged outside of his game-long 32-yard run. Irving did record his third receiving touchdown of the season on a 24-yard catch and run in the first quarter, helping to salvage his fantasy day. Irving's opportunities on the ground were somewhat capped due to a surprising game script that saw Tampa Bay trailing through more than half of the fourth quarter, but he'll have a good chance to bounce back in a Week 15 home matchup against a vulnerable Falcons run defense on Thursday night.
