## üè• Player Report

### üü¢ Cooper Rush (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Rush drew his second straight start in the absence of Lamar Jackson (hamstring). He ran a decent first possession that resulted in a field goal, completing both of his passes for 12 yards while also scrambling for seven. However, he was intercepted on Baltimore's following drive and the team had several additional miscues before Rush was finally pulled after losing a fumble deep in Rams territory late in the third quarter. Jackson is expected back in Week 8 following Baltimore's bye, and Rush could be in danger of being demoted to the third-string quarterback.
</div>

### üü° DJ Moore (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> During Monday's 25-24 win at Washington, Moore paid a visit to the sideline tent but played through whatever was bothering him, logging 60 of 64 offensive snaps (94 percent) and hauling in three of five targets for 42 yards and two carries for 10 yards. Afterward, he was admitted to a local hospital for a precautionary medical evaluation, and coach Ben Johnson relayed to Scott Bair of Marquee Sports Network on Tuesday that Moore was dealing with a groin injury. The Bears listed hip and groin issues as the reasons for Moore's DNP at Wednesday's walkthrough, so his status bears watching in advance of Sunday's game against the Saints.
</div>

### üü¢ Roschon Johnson (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Though Johnson has now suited up four games this season, Monday marked the first time that he's touched the ball in 2025. His role is expected to be contained mostly to special teams while rookie Kyle Monangai serves as the Bears' No. 2 running back behind D'Andre Swift.
</div>

### üü¢ Tee Higgins (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> This was far from a standout performance from Higgins, but it did represent his highest reception and yardage totals of the season. He narrowly missed out on a more impressive fantasy showing, as he was dragged down at Green Bay's one-yard line on a 13-yard reception midway through the third quarter. Higgins was evaluated for a concussion due to the tackle on that same play but was cleared to return without missing a full possession. The Cincinnati offense is still likely to be inconsistent, but Joe Flacco prioritized getting the ball to Higgins and Ja'Marr Chase in his Bengals debut, which has improved the outlook for the star pass catchers.
</div>

### üü¢ Joe Flacco (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Flacco had a quick turnaround after being traded to Cincinnati on Tuesday. Given that and a tough road matchup, he performed relatively well. He led three scoring drives in the second half, highlighted by a two-yard touchdown pass to Tanner Hudson and a 19-yard scoring toss to Ja'Marr Chase. This marked Flacco's first multi-touchdown performance across five starts in 2025, and he should be able to put up respectable numbers with the help of Chase and Tee Higgins.
</div>

### üü¢ Jerome Ford (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Ever since the Browns selected two running backs in the 2025 NFL Draft, it felt like Ford could be flipped at the deadline, which falls on Nov. 4, a day after Week 9 wraps. That Cleveland is 1-5 and seemingly playing for the future only cements that notion. He's primarily served as a third-down back since rookie Quinshon Judkins was established as the starter earlier this season. Lately, Dylan Sampson, a fourth-round draft pick in 2025, has rotated in with Ford, which sets up a scenario where Cleveland trades Ford and allots more playing time to Sampson.
</div>

### üü¢ Christian Kirk (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Kirk had his best day as a Texan due primarily to a 47-yard catch to start the fourth quarter, narrowly missing a touchdown while being taken down at the three-yard line. Houston has spread its targets relatively evenly between several different pass catchers early this season, leaving Kirk with only four targets in consecutive games. That limited volume will hurt his fantasy outlook, though Sunday's big play was encouraging.
</div>

### üü° J.J. McCarthy (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> McCarthy thus has logged an official practice for the first time since suffering a high right-ankle sprain Week 2 against the Falcons. Coach Kevin O'Connell told Alec Lewis of The Athletic earlier Wednesday that both McCarthy and Carson Wentz (shoulder) were slated to take part in drills coming out of the Vikings' Week 6 bye, but he also wasn't ready to name a starting quarterback for Sunday's game against the Eagles. Wentz himself was a full participant Wednesday, so he appears to be a step ahead of McCarthy on that front, though the latter added that his ankle is "getting there. I wouldn't say it's 100 percent," per Ben Goessling of The Minnesota Star Tribune.
</div>

### üü¢ Juwan Johnson (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Johnson suited up after dealing with an ankle issue during practice for the second week in a row. The 29-year-old also logged exactly two catches for the second straight contest, as he recorded season lows in targets and receiving yards. The lowlight of Johnson's performance came on his second catch when he coughed up a fumble in the fourth quarter. Johnson went from averaging 9.7 targets per game over the first three weeks to averaging 3.0 over the last three weeks. This downturn in opportunities has coincided with the overall decrease in passing attempts for the Saints across the last three games, so it appears his dropoff in production may continue so long as the New Orleans offense eases its reliance on Spencer Rattler's arm. Johnson will look to grab more passes during the Week 7 contest versus Chicago on Sunday, Sept. 19.
</div>

### üü¢ Breece Hall (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Hall's workload was his largest of the season yet, as the Broncos and Jets engaged in a slugfest where pass protection was at a premium for Justin Fields, who was sacked nine times. Turning to Hall didn't yield particularly encouraging dividends for New York, however, as Denver's talented defense held the running back to a long run of eight yards. Hall had come in on an encouraging two-game stretch where he'd amassed 194 yards on 28 carries against the suspect defenses of the Dolphins and Cowboys, but the notable increase in the caliber of competition Sunday served to neutralize him. Hall and the Jets get an easier assignment in their return stateside, as the Panthers will pay a visit to MetLife Stadium next Sunday for a Week 7 interconference clash.
</div>

### üü¢ Dallas Goedert (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Goedert led the Eagles across the board in receptions, receiving yards and targets with those marks, and his game-best 36-yard catch also qualified as a season-high figure. The veteran tight end has scored all five of his touchdowns this season over the last four games, and that tally ties a career best for Goedert, who also recorded the same number of trips to the end zone in 2019. With 20 targets in his last two games alone, Goedert will remain a highly viable option in all formats during a Week 7 road matchup against the Vikings on Sunday, Oct. 19.
</div>

### üü¢ Kendrick Bourne (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Fresh off posting a career-best 142 receiving yards against the Rams in Week 5, Bourne likely made his managers double take at the box score after hitting that same mark in consecutive contests. The 29-year-old has shown great chemistry with old teammate Mac Jones, as the former Patriots continue to post video-game numbers filling in for injured 49ers starters in 2025. Bourne continued starting in place of Ricky Pearsall (knee) while Jauan Jennings (ribs) returned in a limited capacity but revealed that he was playing with five broken ribs after the contest. If Pearsall is forced to miss a third consecutive game in Week 7, then Bourne's stock would remain elevated for next Sunday's tilt against the Falcons.
</div>

### üü¢ Zach Charbonnet (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> As made clear by his rushing line, Charbonnet found virtually no running room against a talented Jaguars front seven, and he actually gained 10 fewer rushing yards on two more carries than backfield mate Kenneth Walker. Sunday marked Charbonnet's fourth game with a sub-4.0-yards-per-carry figure this season, so outside of his occasional rushing touchdowns, the third-year back's fantasy outlook remains stagnant heading into a tough Week 7 home matchup against the Texans on Monday night, Oct. 20.
</div>

### üü¢ Kenneth Walker III (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Walker logged two fewer carries than Zach Charbonnet, but he outgained his teammate by 10 rushing yards, as neither back was particularly efficient during the defense-centric battle. The fourth-year pro's yardage total represented quite the downturn after he'd topped the 80-yard mark in each of the previous two games, and Charbonnet's workload is somewhat of a concern for the moment for Walker's fantasy managers. It remains to be seen if a similar timeshare will apply moving forward, but neither player has a particularly bright outlook for a Week 7 home matchup against a tough Texans defense on Monday night, Oct. 20.
</div>

### üü° Terry McLaurin (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The report is just an estimate after the Commanders held a walk-through. McLaurin is expected to resume practicing in earnest Thursday, although presumably with limitations. Commanders coach Dan Quinn said Wednesday that he isn't sure if McLaurin will be ready for Sunday's game at Dallas.
