## Player Report

#### Mark Andrews (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** DeCosta also called Andrews a "warrior" and said he's "a great player... and we're in the business of keeping as many great players as we can." It's not quite the endorsement coach John Harbaugh gave earlier this offseason, which may signal a willingness to listen to trade offers. The Ravens kept Andrews on the roster through mid-March when a $4 million roster bonus kicked in, ending any speculation that he might be released after losing a fumble and dropping a game-tying pass in a playoff loss at Buffalo in January. Other factors working against Andrews include his contract (one year remaining), age (30 in September) and the presence of fellow tight end Isaiah Likely, but most signs point to Andrews playing at least one more season for the Ravens. That said, it won't be surprising if he's part of a draft-day trade.
#### Rico Dowdle (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Dowdle emerged as the Cowboys' top running back last season and rushed for a career-high 1,079 yards on 235 carries (4.6 YPC) with two touchdowns while adding 249 yards on 39 catches and three touchdowns. In Carolina, he'll be joining a backfield headlined by Chuba Hubbard (calf/knee), who had his own breakout last season with a career-best 1,195 rushing yards on 250 carries and 10 touchdowns. Dowdle's fantasy stock may take a hit as a result of being part of a timeshare with Hubbard in a best-case scenario, but the signing gives the up-and-coming Panthers a potentially formidable 1-2 punch out of the backfield. Jonathon Brooks, whom the Panthers selected in the second round of the 2024 NFL Draft, is expected to miss most of next season while recovering from his second torn ACL.
#### Ja'Marr Chase (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Chase officially has gotten his massive deal, which makes him the highest paid non-quarterback in NFL history. In total, he's now under contract for the next five years, in line to earn $182.816 million, per Schultz. The wide receiver has been nothing short of elite during his four-year career with the Bengals, most recently winning the NFL's "triple crown" in 2024, catching 127 of 175 targets for 1,708 yards and 17 touchdowns over 17 regular-season games. Additionally, teammate Tee Higgins and Cincinnati agreed on a four-year, $115 million deal Sunday, keeping both of Joe Burrow's top pass catchers under contract for the foreseeable future.
#### Jalen McMillan (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** One might assume no concerns about job security for a 2024 third-round pick who scored seven TDs over the final five weeks of his initial NFL regular season. Unfortunately for McMillan, there's a chance Egubka proves to be the superior player, and not much chance of Mike Evans or Chris Godwin (ankle) getting benched. Of course, it's also possible the concerns prove unfounded and McMillan cements himself as a quality starter, with Egubka either brought along slowly or getting most of his snaps when Evans/Godwin miss time. There does seem to be a lot of overlap between McMillan, Godwin and Egubka in terms of relative strengths and weaknesses, whereas Evans is a different animal altogether, largely running downfield routes on the perimeter.
