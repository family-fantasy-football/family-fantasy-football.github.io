## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Zay Flowers (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Flowers continued in his typical role, dominating targets and production among the Baltimore pass catchers. He logged long receptions of 27 and 22 yards, his third consecutive game with at least one catch of at least 20 yards. While Flowers is Lamar Jackson's most reliable target, he has not reached 80 receiving yards or found the end zone since Week 1.
</div>

### 🟢 Derrick Henry (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Henry saw at least 20 carries for the third time in his last four games, though he struggled to find much running room. He had long gains of 14 and 13 yards, but nine of his 20 rushing attempts went for two or fewer yards. Henry has now been held below 100 rushing yards in six of nine games for the campaign, with his six touchdowns propping up his fantasy value.
</div>

### 🟢 Josh Allen (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Allen took three sacks and was unofficially hit an additional four times, helping make his yardage total a bit empty from a real-world football perspective. The Bills were unexpectedly forced into a pass-heavy game script after heading into the halftime locker room down by a 16-0 margin, leading Allen to his highest passing yardage total since Week 1. Allen did toss multiple touchdowns for the first time in three games by connecting with Keon Coleman and Jackson Hawes for scoring strikes of 35 and 26 yards, respectively, and he'll aim to take out his frustration on the Buccaneers defense in a Week 11 home matchup next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟡 Samaje Perine (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Perine finished with five yards on his lone carry and was limited to six snaps (one on offense, five on special teams) before exiting Sunday's contest with the injury. Though Perine seems more likely than not to miss game action, he'll benefit from a Week 10 bye before the Bengals reassess his condition once they resume practicing ahead of their Week 11 game in Pittsburgh on Sunday, Nov. 16. Perine's early departure in Week 9 paved the way for starting running back Chase Brown to take on his largest snap share of the season (96 percent).
</div>

### 🟢 Sam LaPorta (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> LaPorta finished third on the team in targets behind both Jameson Williams and Amon-Ra St. Brown, though he still managed to record at least five catches for the fourth time in his last five games. LaPorta logged a pair of 14-yard catches to account for most of his production, and he's now topped 50 receiving yards four times in the same five-game span. He'll remain a consistent part of the Detroit offense, but his upside will be limited on many occasions by St. Brown and Jahmyr Gibbs.
</div>

### 🟢 Amon-Ra St. Brown (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> St. Brown turned in his lowest reception total since Week 1 and his lowest target total since Week 4, but he still managed to turn in a serviceable performance. He was used primarily in the short areas of the field, logging long catches of 16 and 15 yards while also finding the end zone from nine yards away. St.Brown now has eight touchdowns on the campaign and has at least 70 receiving yards or a touchdown in seven of nine contests.
</div>

### 🟢 Jordan Love (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Love's night didn't even live up to his middling numbers, as 71 of the veteran signal-caller's yards came on the last two drives. The Packers' five first-half possessions resulted in four punts and a lost fumble by Love on a sack, and he averaged a season-low 4.9 yards per attempt overall. Love also went without a touchdown pass for the second straight game while producing his fourth sub-200-yard tally of the campaign, leaving him with plenty of room for improvement in a Week 11 road matchup against the Giants on Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Alec Pierce (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Pierce finished second in receptions, receiving yards and targets for the Colts behind Tyler Warren while also catching Daniel Jones' one touchdown pass of the day from 37 yards out in the first quarter. It was the fourth-year pro's first score of the season, and Pierce now has at least 69 receiving yards in four consecutive contests. The 2022 second-round pick is enjoying his most consistent season yet, as he heads into the Week 11 bye having already posted a 28-585-1 receiving line through eight games with 10 catches of 20-plus yards.
</div>

### 🟢 Kareem Hunt (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Isiah Pacheco (knee) was unable to suit up after absorbing a big hit last week, opening the door for Hunt to serve as the Chiefs' primary back against the Bills on Sunday. The 29-year-old Hunt was up to the task, leading his team in rushing yards while collecting his fifth rushing touchdown of the season. Brashard Smith (3-7-0) finished a distant second in backfield touches, as head coach Andy Reid opted to lean on Hunt more instead of continuing a two-back approach in Pacheco's absence. There is a chance the latter will return following the Chiefs' upcoming bye week, but Hunt has been providing enough value in a timeshare to warrant flex consideration against the Broncos in Week 11.
</div>

### 🟢 Tre Tucker (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Tucker became the the Raiders' No. 1 receiver on paper due to the trade of Jakobi Meyers to the Jaguars on Tuesday, but that wasn't exactly reflected on Thursday's stat sheet. Veteran Tyler Lockett, who had gone without a catch in his team debut Sunday against the Jaguars, finished as Las Vegas pace-setter among the pass-catching corps Thursday with a 5-44-0 line on six targets, while had Tucker his lowest catch and receiving yardage totals since Week 4. Whether the pecking order against Denver is just a one-game anomaly remains to be seen, but the entire Raiders offense has a much more appealing matchup in a Week 11 home clash against the Cowboys on Monday night, Nov. 17.
</div>

### 🟢 Keenan Allen (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> It was another low-volume game from Allen following last week's two-catch performance, finishing with five or fewer targets for the third straight contest. The 19 receiving yards also marked a new single-game low in what has been a productive return to the club that drafted the veteran wideout back in 2013. The longtime Charger set a franchise record by surpassing Antonio Gates as the all-time leader in receptions with his 956th catch in 12 years with the club. Allen will attempt to ramp his production back up in a soft matchup against the Jaguars next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Kenneth Gainwell (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Gainwell led the Steelers' running backs by playing 52 percent of the team's offensive snaps during Sunday's blowout loss, but he saw minimal touches against the Chargers. The primetime matchup marked the first time that Gainwell was held without any carries this season, and he failed to generate much production as a pass catcher. While the Steelers' offense generally struggled as a whole against the Chargers, Gainwell's fantasy upside remains limited for the second half of the regular season.
</div>

### 🟢 Cam Ward (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Ward continues to turn in mixed performances, and there were some positive takeaways in Sunday's loss despite his modest stat line. He completed three passes of at least 20 yards and also didn't turn the ball over for the first time this season. Despite those steps forward, Ward still isn't a strong fantasy option, as he has yet to tally multiple touchdowns in a game this season.
</div>

### 🟢 Jacory Croskey-Merritt (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Croskey-Merritt was rotating with Jeremy McNichols in a backup role behind Chris Rodriguez (shoulder) for most of the first half However, Rodriguez didn't record a carry following a one-yard touchdown plunge late in the second quarter, opening up a path for increased touches for Croskey-Merritt. The rookie didn't take particular advantage with a long gain of only six yards, though he could be in line for lead-back duties in Week 11 against Miami if Rodriguez remains sidelined.
