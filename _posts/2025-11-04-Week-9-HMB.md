## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Zay Flowers (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Flowers led the Ravens across the board in receptions, receiving yards and targets after also setting the pace in all three categories during Sunday's win over the Bears. He was back to working with Lamar Jackson on Thursday after the latter's three-game absence due to a hamstring injury, and the third-year receiver now has at least five receptions in five consecutive contests. Flowers next takes aim at the Vikings secondary in a Week 10 road matchup on Sunday, Nov. 9.
</div>

### 🟢 Derrick Henry (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Henry's yardage total, which was partly fueled by a game-long 35-yard run, was his third highest of the season and marked his second time over the 100-yard mark in the last three contests. The bruising running back also has seen his carry volume tick up after averaging just 11.5 per game between Weeks 2-5, as he's logged between 19 and 24 rush attempts in the last three contests. Henry should remain in an elevated role during a Week 10 road matchup against the Vikings on Sunday, Nov. 9.
</div>

### 🟢 Josh Allen (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Allen turned in similar results in the box score to last week's three-score showing against the Panthers, when he threw for a touchdown while cashing in two more from in close with his legs. Unlike his last outing, the 29-year-old was more involved as a passer in Sunday's statement win, finishing with his second-highest yardage total this season while out-dueling Patrick Mahomes in the process. Allen has seen his passing volume take a hit in 2025 as the Bills feature a more run-heavy offense. His current pace projects to 3,895 passing yards, which would result in consecutive seasons finishing below 4,000 yards for the first time since his first two years in the league. Allen has helped offset his more timid presence in the pocket with a whopping seven rushing scores in eight appearances. Look for the good times to continue rolling for Allen in a soft matchup against the Dolphins next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟡 Samaje Perine (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Perine finished with five yards on his lone carry and was limited to six snaps (one on offense, five on special teams) before exiting Sunday's contest with the injury. Though Perine seems more likely than not to miss game action, he'll benefit from a Week 10 bye before the Bengals reassess his condition once they resume practicing ahead of their Week 11 game in Pittsburgh on Sunday, Nov. 16. Perine's early departure in Week 9 paved the way for starting running back Chase Brown to take on his largest snap share of the season (96 percent).
</div>

### 🟢 Sam LaPorta (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> LaPorta tied for the team lead in receiving yards with a total that was also a season-high figure, and he checked in second in both receptions and targets. The talented tight end also rang up his third touchdown of the season -- all which have come within the last four games -- on a 40-yard grab to close out the opening possession of the contest. LaPorta has a solid 35-436-3 receiving line and at least five catches in three of the past four games heading into a Week 10 road matchup against the Commanders.
</div>

### 🟢 Amon-Ra St. Brown (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> St. Brown tied Sam LaPorta for the team lead in receiving yards while setting the pace in both receptions and targets on the afternoon. The star receiver's productive performance was essentially par for the course, as St. Brown has at least seven catches in six of eight contests this season. St. Brown will naturally remain a centerpiece of Detroit's air attack when the Lions attempt to bounce back from Sunday's loss in a Week 10 road matchup against the Commanders.
</div>

### 🟢 Tucker Kraft (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Out<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Coming off a career-best performance in the Packers' Week 8 win over the Steelers in which he registered seven catches for 143 yards and two touchdowns on nine targets, Kraft's breakthrough third season has now come to a screeching halt. The Packers haven't revealed whether the tight end sustained any additional ligament damage beyond the ACL tear, but more information should be known once he undergoes surgery in the coming days or weeks. With Kraft bound for injured reserve, the Packers are expected to turn to Luke Musgrave as their top pass-catching option at tight end for the remainder of the season, while blocking specialist John FitzPatrick could also be in line for extra snaps.
</div>

### 🟢 Jordan Love (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> While Love saw plenty of pass volume he wasn't able to get the ball into the end zone for the first time in 2025, with Josh Jacobs punching in Green Bay's only TD of the afternoon. Those struggles may have stemmed in large part from the loss of Love's favorite target, as tight end Tucker Kraft (knee) left the game in the third quarter and didn't return. Rookie wideout Matthew Golden (shoulder) was also knocked out of the game early in the third quarter, further depleting his downfield options. The Packers still have some depth at WR, especially if Dontayvion Wicks (calf) returns soon, but Love could be facing some extra obstacles in Week 10 against the Eagles.
</div>

### 🟢 Alec Pierce (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Pierce was the beneficiary of Daniel Jones taking to the air 50 times, as he racked up a career-high 13 targets. Pierce began the game well, recording three catches for 64 yards on the Colts' first offensive possession. While he slowed from there until garbage time -- he racked up 43 yards in the final six minutes of the game -- Pierce still managed his first 100-yard performance since Week 17 of the 2024 campaign. Pierce also has a consistent role in the Colts' offense, recording at least 50 receiving yards in each of his last three games.
</div>

### 🟢 Kareem Hunt (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Isiah Pacheco (knee) was unable to suit up after absorbing a big hit last week, opening the door for Hunt to serve as the Chiefs' primary back against the Bills on Sunday. The 29-year-old Hunt was up to the task, leading his team in rushing yards while collecting his fifth rushing touchdown of the season. Brashard Smith (3-7-0) finished a distant second in backfield touches, as head coach Andy Reid opted to lean on Hunt more instead of continuing a two-back approach in Pacheco's absence. There is a chance the latter will return following the Chiefs' upcoming bye week, but Hunt has been providing enough value in a timeshare to warrant flex consideration against the Broncos in Week 11.
</div>

### 🟢 Tre Tucker (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Tucker produced the most yards from any Las Vegas wide receiver Sunday, but he finished a distant third behind TE Brock Bowers (12-127-3) and RB Ashton Jeanty (5-47-1) in receiving. The 24-year-old Tucker has seen his production peter out following his outlier three-score performance back in Week 3, averaging 3.8 receptions and 43.2 yards with no touchdowns in the five games since. Tucker should be viewed as a deep-league option heading into next Sunday's tilt versus the Broncos.
</div>

### 🟢 Keenan Allen (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Justin Herbert distributed targets evenly among his top pass catchers, as Allen tied for second on the team in targets with Oronde Gadsden and Quentin Johnston. Allen finished with the lowest yardage total of that group, with nearly all of his production coming on a 31-yard catch late in the first quarter. After a hot start to the season, Allen has now recorded 50 receiving yards or fewer in three of the last four games.
</div>

### 🟢 Kenneth Gainwell (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Gainwell had logged double-digit rushing yards in each of his first seven appearances this year, and while he didn't have much success on the ground Week 9, he matched his season-best mark in receiving yards in the victory. He also was on the field for 37 percent of the Steelers' offensive snaps, signaling that he remains the team's clear No. 2 back behind Jaylen Warren and ahead of Kaleb Johnson. Gainwell hasn't showcased much fantasy upside as the No. 2 option in the backfield over the first half of the year, but he's at least seen consistent playing time.
</div>

### 🟢 Cam Ward (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Ward continues to turn in mixed performances, and there were some positive takeaways in Sunday's loss despite his modest stat line. He completed three passes of at least 20 yards and also didn't turn the ball over for the first time this season. Despite those steps forward, Ward still isn't a strong fantasy option, as he has yet to tally multiple touchdowns in a game this season.
</div>

### 🟢 Luke McCaffrey (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Out<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> McCaffrey sustained the injury during his 19-yard return on the game's opening kickoff and was quickly ruled out for the rest of the contest. The Commanders haven't provided an official timeline for McCaffrey's return or indicated whether or not he needs surgery, but the young wideout's pending move to IR means that he'll miss at least four games and won't be available again until Week 15 at the soonest. Even before going down with the injury, McCaffrey had handled a understated role in the Washington passing game. Through his nine appearances on the season, McCaffrey hadn't drawn more than three targets in any game, despite top wideout Terry McLaurin (quadriceps) having missed five of those contests.
</div>

### 🟢 Jacory Croskey-Merritt (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Croskey-Merritt managed double-digit rushing attempts for the fourth time in his last five games, though he also ceded a significant amount of work to Chris Rodriguez. The split backfield wasn't solely a product of garbage time, as Croskey-Merritt out-touched Rodriguez only 5-4 at halftime. Washington's choice to change the touch allocation may have come as a result of Croskey-Merritt's inefficiency, as he's now been held below 4.0 yards per carry in four consecutive games while failing to log a rush of at least 20 yards in that span. Overall, he has been held below 40 yards from scrimmage in three straight contests.
