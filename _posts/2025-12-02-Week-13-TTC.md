## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Rico Dowdle (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The fifth-year running back split touches nearly equally with Chuba Hubbard, but it was Hubbard who paced Carolina's backfield with 124 scrimmage yards, including a 35-yard TD reception from Bryce Young in the first quarter. Dowdle has gone three straight games without getting into the end zone himself, producing 141 rushing yards on only 3.3 yards per carry during that stretch, and Hubbard could be re-emerging as the Panthers' top RB. The team will be on bye next week, so clarity in the backfield pecking order likely won't come until a Week 15 clash with the Saints.
</div>

### 🟢 Bryce Young (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The third-year quarterback came up with a heroic effort in the upset win, with two of his TD passes -- a 33-yard strike to Jalen Coker in the third quarter and a 43-yard connection with Tetairoa McMillan in the fourth for the go-ahead score -- coming on fourth-down plays. It's the third three-touchdown performance of the season for Young, and second in the last three games as he finally begins to show signs of emerging as a franchise player for the Panthers. Young will get a well-deserved rest during Carolina's bye next week before facing the Saints in Week 15.
</div>

### 🟢 Chase Brown (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Chase had to claw for most of his yardage Thursday, as his longest run went for a modest 18 yards while his most productive reception netted just nine yards. However, the third-year back still managed a highly fantasy-friendly effort despite the return of backfield mate Samaje Perine from a two-game absence due to an ankle injury. Brown tied Ja'Marr Chase for the team led in receptions while eclipsing the 70-yard mark on the ground for fifth time in the last six contests, affording him plenty of momentum heading into a Week 14 road matchup on Sunday, Dec. 7 against a Bills defense that has struggled to slow down the run all season.
</div>

### 🟢 CeeDee Lamb (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> George Pickens led the Cowboys in targets once again, but Lamb paced the team's pass catchers in receptions and yards, capping his performance with a 15-yard TD from Dak Prescott in the first quarter. It's the fourth time in nine games this season Lamb has hit for triple-digit yards, and the issues he had hanging onto the ball against the Eagles last week were nowhere to be found. The 26-year-old wideout will take a 51-744-3 line on 81 targets into a Week 14 clash with the Lions.
</div>

### 🟢 Troy Franklin (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Franklin cooled off considerably after seemingly taking over the No. 1 WR role for the Broncos in recent weeks. Courtland Sutton reclaimed that honor with a clean 5-62-1 receiving line that dwarfed Franklin's production on the national stage. The latter is still producing a strong sophomore campaign with 48 receptions for 530 yards and five touchdowns across 12 contests, but it hasn't been a smooth ride getting there. Franklin has been held under 40 receiving yards in half of his appearances this season, making him a volatile starting option with plenty of upside against the Raiders in Week 14.
</div>

### 🟢 RJ Harvey (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Harvey finished as the star of Sunday Night Football after giving Denver its third lead in a back-and-forth contest with his first trip to the end zone in the third quarter, following that up with a second touchdown in overtime that wound up being the game-deciding score. The second-round rookie fared better this time around compared to his last outing starting in place of J.K. Dobbins (foot), when he handled a similar workload but failed to hit pay dirt against the Chiefs on Nov. 16. Harvey has registered double-digit carries in consecutive contests for the first time in his career, a trend that figures to continue while he operates as Denver's No. 1 backfield option. The 24-year-old is shaping up to be a strong fantasy play against the lowly Raiders in Week 14.
</div>

### 🟢 Brenton Strange (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Strange caught all three of his passes in the first half, with his most impactful reception coming on a 21-yard touchdown catch, splitting the Tennessee defense down the middle of the field. He chipped in a pair of 12-yard receptions to help set up a field goal as the first half concluded to cap off his day. Strange now has eight receptions on nine targets for 138 yards and a score in two games since returning from injured reserve.
</div>

### 🟢 Xavier Worthy (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Most of the damage came on a 42-yard reception late in the fourth quarter that helped set up Kansas City's final score of the day. Worthy's 61 receiving yards were his highest total since Week 4, and he's gone six straight games without getting into the end zone, posting a 22-256-0 line on 37 targets over that stretch while chipping in another 33 rushing yards. The second-year speedster seems unlikely to break out Week 14 against the Texans.
</div>

### 🟢 Patrick Mahomes (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> It was a vintage performance from Mahomes, who hit Rashee Rice for a pair of TDs while also finding Travis Kelce and Hollywood Brown for scores, but it wasn't quite enough to pull off a win in Dallas. It's the second four-TD performance of the season for Mahomes, and it came in tough circumstances as both his starting tackles, Jawaan Taylor (elbow) and Josh Simmons (wrist), left the game and didn't return. At 6-6, Kansas City's playoff hopes are fading fast, and Mahomes will face a daunting matchup Week 14 to try and keep them alive against the Texans' elite defense.
</div>

### 🟢 Stefon Diggs (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Despite Drake Maye throwing for 282 yards on 24 completions, Diggs was once again a minor player in the air attack. The veteran wideout has 46 yards or fewer in five of his last six games, including back-to-back sub-30-yard tallies. Nevertheless, Diggs has the ability to resurface in a passing game that spreads the wealth around to different targets on a weekly basis, and such an instance could come in a Week 15 matchup against his old Bills teammates on Sunday, Dec. 14 following a Week 14 bye.
</div>

### 🟢 TreVeyon Henderson (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Henderson actually logged one fewer carry than Rhamondre Stevenson, but he outgained his backfield mate by 27 rushing yards and drew one additional target as well. Both backs had ample opportunity thanks to game script, as the Patriots already held a 30-7 lead at halftime. Henderson is still likely the No. 1 option under normal circumstances, but both backs are clearly trusted by the coaching staff. Henderson next takes aim at the Bills' typically generous run defense in a Week 15 home showdown on Sunday, Dec. 14 following a Week 14 bye.
</div>

### 🟡 Tyrone Tracy Jr. (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Tracy took a hard hit early in the fourth quarter and was unable to put much weight on his left leg as he was helped off the field. He was quickly carted to the locker after being examined in the medical tent, suggesting he is unlikely to return to Monday's game given the limited remaining time. Devin Singletary is in line to handle most of the work in the Giants backfield to close the contest.
</div>

### 🟢 Mason Taylor (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Taylor finished second on the team in receiving yards, though he was nowhere close to leading receiver Adonai Mitchell, who caught eight of 12 targets for 102 yards and a touchdown. The Jets don't generate much offense through the air, but Taylor reliably gets a few opportunities per game, as this was only the second time in the last six outings that the rookie second-round pick has been held short of three receptions. Up next for Taylor and the Jets is a Week 14 home game against the Dolphins.
</div>

### 🟢 Sean Tucker (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Tucker and Rachaad White each logged just two carries in the return of Bucky Irving from a seven-game absence, which could be a sign of what's to come down the stretch of the season. Tucker had logged double-digit carries in three of the previous four games with Irving sidelined and proved worthy of additional work, but it remains to be seen how many touches behind Irving will be left over for Tucker and White week to week moving forward.
</div>

### 🟢 Bucky Irving (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Irving notably jumped right back into a true lead-back role in his first game action since Week 4, despite talk during the week he'd see limited snaps. The standout second-year back outpaced both Rachaad White and Sean Tucker by 15 carries, and in addition to his 13-yard scoring run late in the third quarter, he also saw a one-yard touchdown in the second quarter wiped out by a holding penalty. Perhaps just as important as his individual statistics was the fact Irving proved capable of handling a hefty workload immediately, which certainly pleases his fantasy managers heading into a Week 14 home matchup against a vulnerable Saints defense next Sunday.
