## Player Report

#### Marvin Harrison Jr. (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Harrison wound up leading Arizona with 44 receiving yards in a game during which the team generated just 159 yards of offense through the air. The sophomore receiver suffered an uncharacteristic drop on a wide-open deep shot from Kyler Murray that could have resulted in a lengthy touchdown. Harrison continues to flash potential, only to disappear at times like he did against Carolina last week (2-27-0). The high-pedigree receiver should be treated as a boom-or-bust play against the Seahawks on Thursday.
#### James Cook (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Cook served as the ideal complement to the exploits of Josh Allen through the air (228 yards, three touchdowns). The star running back had a game-long run of 26 yards, so he was able to consistently find running room throughout the night. The 2022 second-round pick also recorded his fourth rushing touchdown of the season on a two-yard run to cap off the first drive of the second half, and he'll take a stellar figure of 5.4 yards per carry into a Week 4 home matchup against the Saints on Sunday, Sept. 28.
#### Joe Burrow (QB)
**Injury Status:** Injured Reserve <br>
**Lineup Slot:** IR <br>
**Details:** While coach Zac Taylor declined to provide a timeline for Burrow's recovery, a previous report by Ben Baby of ESPN aligns with Rapoport's estimate that the QB will miss a minimum of three months. With that timetable in mind, Burrow could potentially return later this season, but in the meantime Jake Browning will serve as the Bengals' No. 1 signal-caller.
#### J.K. Dobbins (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** While his new team couldn't secure the victory, Dobbins was able to have a strong game against his former club. The bruising tailback accrued nearly all of his production on an impressive three-play drive to open the second half, during which he took three consecutive carries for 66 yards all the way to the end zone. Dobbins finished the contest with nine more rushing attempts than backup RJ Harvey, cementing his status as Denver's No. 1 option out of the backfield. The 26-year-old Dobbins will attempt to extend his current scoring streak to four games when the Broncos host the Bengals on Monday Night Football in Week 4.
#### Jared Goff (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Goff can usually be counted on for at least one major spike performance each campaign, and such an instance came early this season. The veteran signal-caller was nearly perfect while finishing with 156.0 QB rating, and he spread the ball around to eight different targets overall. Goff's scoring strikes went to Brock Wright (eight yards), Amon-Ra St. Brown (four, eight and four yards) and Jameson Williams (44 yards), helping the Lions' offense atone in spectacular fashion for its sleepy Week 1 performance against the Packers. Putting together a comparable encore could prove challenging, however, as the Lions travel to Baltimore to face the Ravens in a Week 3 showdown on Monday night, Sept. 22.
#### Romeo Doubs (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Doubs' final line was a emblematic of a tough day for Jordan Love overall against the Browns' aggressive defense. The veteran wideout is expected to see elevated volume in some games while Jayden Reed (IR, collarbone/foot) remains out, but Sunday's game environment didn't allow for such a boost. However, Doubs could be exponentially more involved when the Packers travel to Dallas to face the Cowboys in a Sunday night Week 4 clash that presents as a much more favorable matchup.
#### Matthew Golden (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The rookie first-round pick had struggled through his first two weeks as a pro while generating a 2-16-0 line on four targets in that span. Therefore, Sunday's performance was essentially a mini-breakout by comparison, and in addition to producing a team-high receiving yardage figure, Golden also logged multiple rush attempts for the second consecutive contest. With Jayden Reed (IR, collarbone/foot) out for an extended period, Golden should progressively carve out a larger role in coming weeks.
#### Tyler Warren (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Daniel Jones targeted his pass catchers evenly, as Warren was one of four players with between four and six targets. He had the worst statistical day of his rookie season given the lack of volume, though he did manage long gains of 15 and 17 yards. Warren's weekly production may vary while competing for targets with Michael Pittman, Josh Downs and Alec Pierce, but he has already established himself as one of the more reliable fantasy tight ends.
#### Travis Hunter (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Hunter had a nice splash play on his one reception, his longest gain yet as a pro. However, the rookie also saw his lowest target total to date, leading to new lows in receptions and receiving yards as well. Meanwhile, Hunter was heavily involved on defense, but it would be accurate to say the Colorado product has been a significant disappointment as an offensive player over three games. Trevor Lawrence's own struggles in Liam Coen's offense certainly have a part to play, and perhaps the duo will have better chemistry in a Week 4 road trip to San Francisco.
#### Dyami Brown (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Before that, Brown had caught two of his three targets for seven yards. In his absence, Brian Thomas, Travis Hunter and Parker Washington figure to lead the Jaguars' Week 3 WR corps.
#### Ashton Jeanty (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** The rookie running back failed to see a target for the first time in his brief career, but Jeanty did little with his six targets in his first two games, so it was little surprise to see his role as a pass catcher reduced. The 63 rushing yards did represent his best effort so far on the ground, but it was still far from a breakout performance for the sixth overall pick in the 2025 Draft. Jeanty stands a better chance of making an impact in Week 4 against a Bears defense that has been one of the worst units in the NFL to begin the year.
#### Omarion Hampton (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Hampton exploded in a major way, but only after Najee Harris suffered a non-contact Achilles injury that is expected to keep him out all year. The rookie ran with a burst that had been missing early in season, but he still finished under 4.0 yards per carry as the Broncos keyed in on stopping the run in the second half. Hassan Haskins and Kimani Vidal will likely see some platoon work to replace Harris in the coming weeks, but it was encouraging to see Hampton immediately fill the void as a pass-catching back given he profiles as the obvious best option currently on the roster.
#### Ollie Gordon II (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The rookie sixth-round pick capped off the opening possession of the night with a two-yard touchdown run, his first NFL score. Gordon had logged only three total carries through the first two games, making his workload boost Thursday night particularly notable. Lead back De'Von Achane finished with just three more carries than Gordon, although the former was also targeted nine times. Given Gordon was productive with his opportunities against Buffalo, he could fill a solid complementary role once again in a Week 4 home matchup against the Jets on Monday night, Sept. 29.
#### Russell Wilson (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Wilson was unable to replicate his heroics from Week 2, averaging only 5.0 yards per attempt while also throwing an interception deep in Chiefs territory late in the second quarter. That halted the Giants' offensive momentum and set the tone for an abysmal overall showing. Wilson has struggled to move the offense in two of three games this season and will draw another tough assignment in Week 4 against the Chargers.
#### Chig Okonkwo (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Okonkwo paced the Titans in targets, receptions and yards and continues to show rapport with Cam Ward. His longest catch of the day came on the team's opening possession, when he recorded a gain of 22 yards to set up a field goal. Okonkwo now has four catches and six targets in each of his last two games.
