## Player Report

#### Trey McBride (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** The Cardinals' offense completely stalled in the second half, with Kyler Murray throwing for only 78 yards in the final two quarters. That led to a muted stat line for McBride, who still led the team in targets and was tied for the lead in receptions. However, his longest catch of the day went for only 12 yards, and he's now been held below 55 yards in each of his last three games.
#### DeAndre Hopkins (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Hopkins was a complete non-factor Sunday, failing to record a single catch while playing just 18 of the Ravens' 54 offensive snaps. The veteran wideout's one target was his lowest total of the season after seeing two targets in each of the first three games. Despite his stature as a five-time Pro Bowl selection, Hopkins isn't seeing consistent enough volume to be relied to be relied upon for fantasy purposes.
#### Chuba Hubbard (RB)
**Injury Status:** Out <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** out
#### Ja'Marr Chase (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Chase and the entire Bengals' offense got off to a slow start, as he had only four catches on eight targets for 31 yards at halftime. That changed quickly in the final two quarters, as Chase took his two targets for 15- and 64-yard touchdowns. The latter was particularly impressive, as he beat Amik Robertson on a double move to get wide open behind the defense. Chase's weekly outlook is hurt by the subpar play of Jake Browning, though Chase is talented enough to overcome the poor offensive environment and showcased that ability in Sunday's loss.
#### David Montgomery (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Montgomery made his initial impact in the game as a passer, taking a direct snap and delivering a three-yard touchdown pass to Brock Wright early in the second quarter. He got going as a rusher in the second half, racking up 12 carries for 62 yards -- highlighted by an eight-yard touchdown run midway through the third quarter. While it wasn't his most efficient performance, Montgomery bounced back from a poor Week 4 showing while logging a season-high 18 carries.
#### Dalton Schultz (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Schultz was C.J. Stroud's favorite target in the first half, recording four receptions on four targets for 53 yards. Schultz played a key role on multiple scoring drives for Houston, recording 11- and 12-yard receptions to keep a pair of possessions alive on third down before logging a 21-yard catch to set up a touchdown just before halftime. This was Schultz's highest yardage total of the season, and he has five receptions in three consecutive contests.
#### Josh Downs (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** On a day when Daniel Jones spread the ball around in customary fashion, Downs' six receptions qualified as a team-high figure. The third-year wideout's yardage tally was also a new season high, although as his 9.0 yards per reception corroborates, Downs continues to be utilized almost exclusively in a short-area role. While his upside remains capped as a result, Downs particularly holds appeal in PPR formats heading into a Week 6 home matchup against the Cardinals next Sunday afternoon.
#### Matthew Stafford (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** Stafford averaged an impressive 8.3 yards per attempt and facilitated four tallies of over 65 receiving yards for his arsenal of pass catchers. The veteran signal-caller connected with Kyren Williams (14 and eight yards) and Puka Nacua (one yard) for his trio of scoring tosses, his second consecutive such tally and fourth straight of multiple TD passes. Stafford's last two games have seen him put the ball up over 40 times apiece, which is a significant departure from his first three contests of the campaign when he averaged 31.6 pass attempts per contest. Stafford will next take aim at an injury-ravaged Ravens defense in a Week 6 road matchup on Sunday, Oct. 12.
#### Rhamondre Stevenson (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Stevenson led New England's three-headed backfield with his seven carries Sunday, rewarding fantasy managers with a pair of trips to the end zone. The bad news for the veteran rusher was that his ball security woes continued with his third lost fumble in as many games. Stevenson's case of fumblitis didn't cost his team a shot at victory like it did in Week 3 against the Steelers. That said, it wouldn't be surprising if the Patriots lean more heavily on TreVeyon Henderson and Antonio Gibson going forward if Stevenson is unable to correct his turnover issues.
#### Spencer Rattler (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The second-year QB led the Saints to their first win of the season with another relatively quiet, but turnover-free, performance. Rattler was able to pick his spots against a poor Giants secondary, connecting with Rashid Shaheed on an 87-yard catch-and-run TD in the second quarter. Rattler doesn't appear to be in much danger of losing his starting job to rookie Tyler Shough despite the team's 1-4 record, posting a 6:1 TD:INT and 67.2 percent completion rate, albeit with a poor 5.6 YPA. He'll look to build on this performance in Week 6 against the Patriots.
#### A.J. Brown (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Brown finished second in receptions and third in targets during a busy day for the Eagles' passing attack, but he averaged just 8.6 yards per grab against Denver's tough defense. Brown's reception and receiving yardage tallies were his second highest of the season, but through five games, he has just a single touchdown catch and only one game of more than 43 receiving yards as well. Brown won't have to wait long for his next opportunity to put an end to that unfavorable trend, as he draws a favorable Week 6 road matchup against the Giants on Thursday night.
#### Brian Robinson Jr. (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Starter Christian McCaffrey gobbled up a season high 76 snaps on offense (88 percent) Thursday, leaving just scraps for Robinson, even with the 49ers missing several key offensive players on a short week. The veteran backup finished with his worst per-carry average (2.4 yards) since being traded to San Francisco this preseason. Robinson's lack of involvement in the passing game (three targets) coupled with zero trips to the end zone through five appearances make him a poor fantasy option Week 6 against the Buccaneers.
#### Cooper Kupp (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Kupp produced his second-best receiving line as a member of the Seahawks while finishing in a tie with Jaxon Smith-Njigba for the team lead in targets (nine) Sunday. The 32-year-old Kupp was held out of the end zone for the fifth time in as many games this season, resulting in a useful PPR score and not much else. The former Los Angeles Ram has carved out a decent role as the Seahawks' No. 2 receiver, but he lacks the upside that once made him a must-start option in fantasy. Kupp's upside is capped as a flex option for a Week 6 matchup against the Jaguars.
#### Sam Darnold (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Darnold's untimely interception in the closing moments of Sunday's narrow loss could not erase the gaudy passing numbers he provided fantasy managers Sunday. It was the 28-year-old's first start this season eclipsing the 300-yard mark in passing, and the most comfortable he has looked running Seattle's offense through five starts. Darnold will attempt to combine strong results with a Seahawks win in a road matchup against the Jaguars next Sunday.
#### Jaxon Smith-Njigba (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Smith-Njigba put it all together with his first game of the season recording 100 or more yards while also nabbing a touchdown. The outpouring of fantasy production was a welcome sight after the star receiver experienced a gradual reduction in targets from the high-water mark of 13 he set back in Week 1. JSN bumped his receiving line up to 34-534-2 through five appearances as he settles in as QB Sam Darnold's most-trusted option in the passing game. Managers can start Smith-Njigba with confidence heading into a Week 6 road matchup against the Jaguars next Sunday.
