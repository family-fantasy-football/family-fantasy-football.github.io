## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Khalil Shakir (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Shakir had an acrobatic catch overturned by replay in the first quarter, and he otherwise had a quiet night despite tying for the team lead in receptions and targets. The fourth-year wideout had come into Monday on a reasonably productive run in which he produced a 11-124-1 receiving line on 14 targets over the prior pair of contests. He'll face a tough challenge against the talented Panthers secondary when the Bills take on Carolina on the road following their Week 7 bye.
</div>

### 🟢 Harold Fannin Jr. (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> With David Njoku (knee) sidelined, an elevated workload was expected for Fannin. While the rookie did lead the Browns across the board in receptions, receiving yards and targets, all three numbers were modest on an afternoon where Dillon Gabriel threw for only 116 yards. Fannin does have clear chemistry with his fellow rookie, however, keeping him in play for a Week 8 road matchup against the Patriots.
</div>

### 🟢 Jake Ferguson (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Ferguson continued his red zone prowess Sunday, extending his scoring streak to four games while recording his sixth touchdown over that span. The 26-year-old is on pace for a career year with 51 receptions, 334 yards and a career-high six touchdowns in just seven games played this season. Fantasy managers should probably continue playing with house money and start Ferguson without question against the Broncos next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 George Pickens (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Cowboys' No. 1 wideout CeeDee Lamb (ankle) made a successful return following a three-week layoff Sunday, producing a 5-110-1 receiving line in a blowout victory. That didn't cause Pickens to cool off, but it may have played a role in the talented No. 2 receiver's scoring streak ending at five games. Pickens' six targets Sunday were closer to the 7.2 he averaged in the three games Lamb was active for, as opposed to the 8.7 targets he received filling in as Dallas' No. 1 option. Look for both talented starters to be featured in a tough road matchup against the Broncos next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Jahmyr Gibbs (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Gibbs saved his best for the bright lights of Monday Night Football, generating his first 100-yard rushing game this season while going over 200 yards from scrimmage for the first time in his career. The fantasy stud had cooled off over the Lions' last two contests, so managers have to feel elated receiving Monday's late boon to their scores. David Montgomery struggled to generate 39 total yards on 15 touches, but he remains a steady presence as part of Detroit's thunder and lightning backfield. Gibbs sprints into the upcoming bye week tallying 720 combined yards from scrimmage and seven total touchdowns through seven starts in 2025. Fantasy GMs will have to hold things together until the Lions resume play against the Vikings on Sunday, Nov. 2.
</div>

### 🟢 Woody Marks (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Marks received double-digit carries for the second time this year, but he barely averaged more than one yard per tote. The fourth-round rookie did almost all of his damage exclusively as a receiver, catching his second touchdown of the season to cut Seattle's lead to one score in the fourth quarter. Marks did come up hobbling following his late touchdown grab, so make sure he doesn't pop up on the injury report leading up to Sunday's tilt against San Francisco.
</div>

### 🟢 Michael Pittman Jr. (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The veteran wideout led the Colts in catches, although both Alec Pierce and Tyler Warren hauled in more yardage, and Pittman capped his day with a four-yard TD from Daniel Jones in the second quarter. Pittman has yet to top 80 receiving yards in a game this season, as the Indy offense has mainly run through Jonathan Taylor, but the former has had a nose for the end zone, compiling a 35-351-5 line on 47 targets through seven contests. Pittman could be in line to make a splash again in Week 8 against the Titans.
</div>

### 🟢 Daniel Jones (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The 28-year-old QB threw multiple TD passes for a third straight game, hitting Pittman and Tyler Warren for scores in the red zone during the second quarter. Jones might have posted even better numbers in a more competitive contest, but the Colts focused on killing the clock in the fourth quarter after building a 38-17 lead. Jones already appears to be almost a shoe-in for the Comeback Player of the Year Award after seven weeks in charge of the Indy offense, leading the team to an NFL-best 6-1 record, and he'll take a 71.0 percent completion rate and 10:3 TD:INT into a Week 8 meeting with the Titans.
</div>

### 🟢 Bhayshul Tuten (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The five carries are pretty standard for Tuten, though it's more notable in this contest given that starter Travis Etienne carried just eight times. That likely had more to do with a lopsided game script than anything else, but it's still worth noting with Tuten positioned as Jacksonville's No. 2 tailback. The rookie fourth-round pick enters the bye week with 27 carries for 108 yards, six receptions for 59 yards and two total touchdowns in seven games.
</div>

### 🟢 Justin Herbert (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The 420 yards were a career high for Herbert, exceeding the 405 yards he racked up in 2023 during a Week 3 meeting with the Vikings. Most of that production came in the second half Sunday, including all three of the QB's touchdowns -- strikes to Quentin Johnston and Keenan Allen in the third quarter and Oronde Gadsden in the fourth, all in the red zone -- as the Chargers tried in vain to rally from a 23-3 halftime deficit. Herbert will take a 13:6 TD:INT through seven starts into a Week 8 meeting with the 2025 edition of a Minnesota defense that just got torched by Jalen Hurts.
</div>

### 🟢 Davante Adams (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Adams had an efficient day at the office Sunday, converting over half of his receptions into touchdowns for the fans in London. The veteran superstar took full advantage of Puka Nacua's (ankle) absence, matching the three touchdowns Adams posted over his first six starts with Los Angeles in one fell swoop. The 32-year-old Adams has provided fantasy managers with a 31-431-6 receiving line in what is shaping up to be a renaissance season in 2025. With the Rams entering a bye in Week 8, there is a realistic possibility that Nacua returns from a low-ankle sprain against the Saints in Week 9. If that's the case, Adams' run as the Rams' WR1 will have lasted just one week, but he is still a must-start asset in fantasy even as the team's No. 2 option.
</div>

### 🟢 T.J. Hockenson (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The veteran tight end finished second on the Vikings in receptions and third in both receiving yards and targets. Hockenson's final line would have looked a lot better had a diving attempt at a touchdown catch that he made with just over three minutes remaining would have survived instant replay review. He did match his season high in catches and set a new high-water mark in targets, so he's trending up heading into an intriguing Week 8 road matchup against the Chargers on Thursday night.
</div>

### 🟢 Drake Maye (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Patriots pulled away from the Titans midway through the third quarter and also scored a defensive touchdown, both of which limited Maye's pass attempts. However, he was excellent with his opportunities, completing four passes of at least 20 yards --  highlighted by a 39-yard touchdown toss to Kayshon Boutte late in the second quarter to give New England a lead it wouldn't relinquish. Maye also supplemented his work through the air with his highest rushing total of the campaign.  He has now thrown for multiple touchdowns and averaged over 9.0 yards per attempt in five of seven games this season.
</div>

### 🟢 Alvin Kamara (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Kamara was stymied on the ground by a Bears defense that had been vulnerable against the run, and he uncharacteristically did next to nothing with his three catches. The versatile veteran has been held to 31 rushing yards or fewer in three straight games and hasn't recorded a rushing touchdown since Week 1, leaving his fantasy outlook bleak as a Week 8 home matchup against a tough Buccaneers run defense awaits next Sunday afternoon.
</div>

### 🟡 Ricky Pearsall (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
