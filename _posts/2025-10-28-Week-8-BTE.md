## üè• Player Report

### üü¢ Jacoby Brissett (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Making his second straight start in place of Kyler Murray (foot), Brissett had another productive performance as he connected with Trey McBride for a 15-yard score in the second quarter and a 12-yard strike in the third. The veteran QB has thrown for 599 yards in place of Murray -- the best two-game stretch of his career -- with a 4:1 TD:INT, but with Arizona on bye in Week 8, Brissett may be returning to the bench for a Week 9 tilt against the Cowboys' porous defense.
</div>

### üü° Roschon Johnson (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### üü¢ DJ Moore (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The 73 yards were a season high for Moore, although most of that production came late in the fourth quarter on a desperation heave by Caleb Williams that the 28-year-old wideout made a spectacular one-handed grab on as he raced down the sideline. Moore has taken a back seat to Rome Odunze in the Bears' passing game this season, leaving him with a 26-331-1 line on 38 targets through seven games, but he's maintained a steady PPR floor by catching at least three passes in every contest. Moore will look for a ceiling game in Week 9 against the Bengals.
</div>

### üü° Joe Flacco (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Flacco appears to have injured his shoulder during Cincinnati's dramatic 39-38 loss to the Jets in Week 8 in which the veteran signal-caller completed 21 of 34 passes for 233 yards and two touchdowns, while rushing twice for 14 yards and another score. Taylor said Flacco is "sore" Monday. In three starts since being traded to the Bengals, Flacco has rejuvenated Cincinnati's offense, throwing multiple touchdowns and compiling over 200 passing yards in all of those contests. His health will need to be closely monitored as the Bengals prepare to host the Bears in Week 9 on Sunday, Nov. 2. If Flacco is limited, or if backup Jake Browning is thrust into the lineup, it will represent a blow to the fantasy value of all of WRs Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins and RB Chase Brown.
</div>

### üü¢ Tee Higgins (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Higgins got free for a 44-yard touchdown in the second quarter, but that was his only catch as he was out-targeted 19-2 by Ja'Marr Chase. Higgins has scored in three of his last four games and has 202 yards in three games since Joe Flacco took over under center in Cincinnati. While the gap between Chase and Higgins is sizable, Higgins has been much more of a factor with Flacco than he had been while catching passes from Jake Browning. Higgins and the Bengals will host the Bears in Week 9.
</div>

### üü¢ C.J. Stroud (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Stroud was in a zone throughout most of the afternoon following a difficult performance on the road against the Seahawks on Monday night to close out Week 7. The third-year signal-caller was working without Nico Collins (concussion) and Christian Kirk (hamstring), but he recorded 14 of his completions to a trio of wideouts playing elevated roles in Xavier Hutchinson, Jaylin Noel and Jayden Higgins. Stroud's pair of scoring tosses went to Hutchinson (30 yards) and Higgins (12 yards) as well, and his yardage total was a season-high figure. Stroud now has multiple touchdown passes in three of the last four games, but he has an unenviable task on tap in Week 9 in the form of a home matchup against the Broncos.
</div>

### üî¥ J.J. McCarthy (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### üü¢ Juwan Johnson (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Johnson logged five catches on at least seven targets for the second week in a row. The tight end once again finished third on the team in targets, receptions, and yards behind wide receivers Chris Olave (12-8-63) and Rashid Shaheed (12-9-75). The Saints benched starting quarterback Spencer Rattler for rookie Tyler Shough in the third quarter, as the passing offense continued to struggle in this game. New Orleans still logged 51 passing attempts as a team. If the team continues to air it out while playing from behind, then Johnson's fantasy production should benefit with a healthy number of targets going forward. New Orleans' next game will come versus the Rams in Week 8.
</div>

### üü¢ Devin Neal (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The rookie sixth-rounder served as the Saints' RB2 with Kendre Miller out for the season after suffering a torn ACL in Week 7. New Orleans benched starting quarterback Spencer Rattler for rookie Tyler Shough late in the third quarter, and the offense abandoned the running game with just 15 carries as a team. Neal still played 46 percent of offensive snaps while operating behind Alvin Kamara, who only played 51 percent of offensive snaps. Neal will look for more rushing opportunities as New Orleans' offense looks to right the ship Week 8 versus the Rams.
</div>

### üü¢ Breece Hall (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Hall scored his first touchdown of the season on a five-yard run early in the fourth quarter, then doubled that total with a 27-yard touchdown run that featured some impressive footwork to stay inbounds along the sideline. He capped the improbable fourth-quarter comeback with a four-yard touchdown pass to Mason Taylor, as the ensuing PAT gave the Jets their first lead of the game with 1:54 remaining before the defense closed the door. Hall will have a Week 9 bye to help his recovery from a knee injury that limited his practice participation and had him listed as questionable heading into Sunday's win, and he should reprise his role as the team's top backfield option in Week 10 against the Browns.
</div>

### üü¢ Josh Reynolds (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Injured Reserve<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Reynolds appeared on Friday's injury report due to a hip injury. Not only has he been ruled out for Sunday's game against the Bengals, but the injury is severe enough to warrant a stint on IR for the veteran wide receiver. Reynolds will be required to miss at least the next four games, which makes Week 13 against the Falcons on Sunday, Nov. 30 the earliest he is eligible to return. With Reynolds on IR and Garrett Wilson (knee) ruled out for Week 8, the Jets' wide receiver corps will consist of Arian Smith, Allen Lazard, Tyler Johnson, Isaiah Williams and Brandon Smith.
</div>

### üü¢ Dallas Goedert (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> While he didn't see much volume, Goedert celebrated National Tight End Day in style with a six-yard TD in the second quarter and a 17-yard score in the fourth. The veteran TE may be disappointed he won't get to play the Giants again in 2025 after racking up 12 catches on 14 targets for 138 yards and three touchdowns against them in two meetings. Goedert rolls into the Eagles' Week 9 bye with an overall 30-289-7 line on 39 targets through seven contests.
</div>

### üü¢ Kendrick Bourne (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Bourne was second in receiving yards on the 49ers despite his modest total, and he contributed a pair of first downs on his trio of grabs. Bourne continues to work as the No. 2 receiver due to the absence of Ricky Pearsall (knee), but after back-to-back 142-yard tallies versus the Rams and Buccaneers in Weeks 5 and 6, the Eastern Washington product has generated a modest 5-58-0 line on six targets over the subsequent pair of contests. Bourne will continue working in a starting role if Pearsall is unable to return for next Sunday's Week 9 matchup on the road against the Giants.
</div>

### üü¢ Zach Charbonnet (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Charbonnet was the money-maker out of Seattle's talented backfield duo Monday, cashing in both of his team's rushing touchdowns on the evening. Kenneth Walker (17-66-0) received five more carries and was the game's leading rusher, but it is obvious which stat line fantasy GMs would have preferred in Week 7. Charbonnet has five touchdowns in six games, but his usage in short yardage and at the goal line has contributed to a career-worst 2.8 YPC. The skilled backup should continue generating flex value when the Seahawks come out of a Week 8 bye to face the Commanders on Nov. 2.
</div>

### üü¢ Kenneth Walker III (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Walked finished as the Seahawks' leading rusher with a team-high number of rushes on Monday Night Football. However, fellow RB Zach Charbonnet cashed in on a pair of goal-line carries en route to a 12-49-2 rushing line. Walker still is providing more volume out of Seattle's backfield through seven weeks, generating 430 rushing yards off of a career-best 4.7 YPC with three trips to the end zone himself. Both talented rushers will be worth starting in fantasy when the Seahawks return from the upcoming bye week to face the Commanders on Sunday, Nov. 2.
</div>

### üü° Terry McLaurin (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> McLaurin left the game in the fourth quarter with the Commanders trailing by multiple touchdowns, so perhaps it was a bit precautionary on Washington's end to keep him out for the remainder of the contest. However, it does sound like the veteran wideout did aggravate the previous quad injury that kept him out the previous four games prior to his return to action Monday. The Commanders now are on a short week ahead of next Sunday's home game against the Seahawks. McLaurin should be considered questionable for the Week 9 affair.
