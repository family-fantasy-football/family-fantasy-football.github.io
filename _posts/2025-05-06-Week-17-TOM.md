## Player Report

#### Jerome Ford (RB)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Ford's salary reduction follows the Browns' selection of second-round running back Quinshon Judkins at No. 33 overall in April's draft, in addition to running back Dylan Sampson in the fourth round. Per Kabot, had Ford not agreed to a pay cut he would have been a trade candidate, and Cleveland may have re-signed free agent Nick Chubb  (foot). With Ford's spot on the roster now essentially guaranteed, the door appears closed for Chubb to reunite with the Browns, barring damage to the team's depth. Zac Jackson and Lauren Smith of The Athletic report that Ford currently retains his hold on the top spot on the depth chart, but his pay cut is a clear indication the role will be up for grabs if Judkins logs a more impressive offseason.
#### Tank Dell (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Wilson reports that Dell is making "steady and impressive progress with major steps taken" following a pair of surgeries to repair the MCL, LCL and ACL in his left knee after he was injured in the Texans' Week 16 loss to the Chiefs. There have been rumblings that Dell could miss most, if not all, of the 2025 season. In an effort to stabilize the wide receiver position following Dell's serious injury and the departure of Stefon Diggs in free agency, the Texans acquired Christian Kirk and then used second- and third-round picks on Jayden Higgins and Jaylin Noel, respectively.
#### Chris Olave (WR)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** IR <br>
**Details:** Olave, a 2022 first-round pick, now will have his rookie contract run through 2026, with its final year projected at a guaranteed $16.8 million salary. The star wideout missed the final eight games of 2024 due to a concussion -- his second of the season -- though he did resume practicing in full for the regular season's final two weeks. New head coach Kellen Moore called Olave a "phenomenal player" at the 2025 NFL owners meeting in early April, per Michael Rothstein of ESPN.com, expressing that the team has a plan moving forward to factor "the circumstances he is in" from a medical perspective.
