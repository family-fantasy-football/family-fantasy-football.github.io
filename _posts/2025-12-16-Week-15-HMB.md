## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Zay Flowers (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Lamar Jackson ended up attempting only 12 passes on the day as the Ravens defense dominated, but one of those tosses went  for a 28-yard TD to Flowers in the second quarter. It was the third-year wideout's first trip to the end zone since Week 1, but it continued a productive stretch for Flowers that has seen him top 60 yards in six of eight games since Baltimore's bye while compiling a 37-536-1 line on 54 targets. Flowers will likely be a little busier in Week 16 against the Patriots.
</div>

### 🟢 Derrick Henry (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> It's the fifth time this season Henry has reached the century mark in rushing yards this season, but his 11 totes were by far his lowest volume in any of those performances, as he posted three runs of over 20 yards in the third quarter to help put the game away. Henry is gaining momentum once again late in a campaign, and over the last three games he's averaging 5.5 yards per carry. The veteran back will look to keep rolling in Week 16 against the Patriots as the Ravens scramble to try and remain in the playoff picture.
</div>

### 🟢 Josh Allen (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Bills were in dire straits after a sluggish first half, as they went into the halftime locker room with a 24-7 deficit. However, as has often been the case this season, Allen donned his proverbial Superman cape with a significant assist from sidekick James Cook, who was on the receiving end of a five-yard scoring toss from Allen for Buffalo's only first-half points. Allen added four- and 14-yard touchdown passes to Dawson Knox in the second half, finishing with his second consecutive three-TD tally. The Bills naturally improved their chances of catching the Patriots for the AFC East crown with the successful rally, and Allen will aim to carry over the momentum into a Week 16 road matchup against an aggressive Myles Garrett-led Browns pass rush next Sunday.
</div>

### 🟢 Jerry Jeudy (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Jeudy was limited to his fewest catches since Week 12, while his 22 receiving yards were his least since Week 11. The wide receiver has now finished with fewer than 40 yards in four of the last five games and eight times overall this season. Jeudy will look to bounce back at home in Week 16 against the Bills.
</div>

### 🟢 Shedeur Sanders (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Sanders had given the Browns' offense some signs of life in his three starts, and he was coming off the best performance in Week 14. However, that momentum came to a sudden halt in Sunday's blowout loss, as he turned the ball over three times while also taking five sacks. The lone positive was that Sanders showed some rapport with Isaiah Bond on deep balls, as the duo connected for long gains of 47 and 42 yards. Sanders will draw another tough assignment in Week 15 against the Bills.
</div>

### 🟢 Amon-Ra St. Brown (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> St. Brown's pair of scores in the first half helped give the Lions a couple of early leads in Sunday's shootout. While his team wasn't able to hang on to win the contest, the fantasy star did his part while recording season-high marks in receptions, targets and yardage. St. Brown has looked like his usual dominant self in the two games since giving his fantasy managers a scare with an early exit due to an ankle injury on Thanksgiving Day. The 25-year-old's standout performance against the Rams helped him reach 1,000 receiving yards for the fourth consecutive campaign. St. Brown boasts a healthy 94-1,140-11 receiving line heading into next Sunday's tilt against Pittsburgh.
</div>

### 🟢 Jordan Love (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Love attempted at least 40 passes for only the second time this season, and for the first time since Week 4. He had plenty of strong moments, highlighted by four completions of at least 20 yards, as well as a scramble that picked up 24 yards. Love's lone touchdown of the game came on a lofted pass to the back corner of the end zone to Josh Jacobs from 14 yards away. While those moments helped keep the Packers in the game, Love threw a pair of key picks -- one that led to a Broncos touchdown and another that ended a potential game-tying drive late in the fourth quarter. He should have the chance to bounce back in a softer Week 16 matchup in an NFC North showdown with the Bears.
</div>

### 🟢 Alec Pierce (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Pierce was limited to a season-low 16 receiving yards while reeling in just one catch for the second time in four weeks. The wide receiver was working with 44-year-old Philip Rivers for the first time, and the veteran quarterback struggled to push the ball down the field, completing 18 of 27 passes for 120 yards in the contest. Pierce has proven to be an elite vertical threat in his fourth campaign in Indianapolis, securing 13 receptions of 20-plus yards, but his upside could be limited moving forward if Rivers remains the starter.
</div>

### 🟢 Kareem Hunt (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Hunt was stonewalled on the ground by a Chargers defense that had often been beatable this season, and he also logged five fewer carries than backfield mate Isiah Pacheco, who didn't fare any better than Hunt while churning out just 1.9 yards per carry. The entire outlook for the Chiefs' offense also darkened considerably once it was confirmed Patrick Mahomes suffered a torn ACL on Sunday,  per Adam Schefter of ESPN, so Hunt may continue to find running room at a premium over the final three games of the season.
</div>

### 🟢 Tre Tucker (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Tucker tied for second on the team in targets, though he managed only two catches for modest gains of 13 and 11 yards. All of his targets and production came with Geno Smith (hand) under center, so his outlook is murky heading into a Week 15 matchup against the Eagles with Kenny Pickett potentially leading the offense. Even if Smith is able to suit up, Tucker has now been held to under 30 receiving yards in three straight games.
</div>

### 🟢 Keenan Allen (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> The Chargers had just four wide receivers on the active roster for Sunday's AFC West tilt, with Quentin Johnston (groin) being the noticeable absentee. Allen paced the Chargers pass catchers with a team-high seven targets and finished with the third-most receiving yards behind rookies Oronde Gadsden (61) and Tre' Harris (49). Allen's catches and targets were his highest since Week 7 against the Colts (11 catches on 14 targets for 119 yards and a score). Next up for Allen and the Chargers is a Week 16 road tilt against the Cowboys on Sunday, Dec. 21.
</div>

### 🟢 Colby Parkinson (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Parkinson turned in his finest fantasy performance to date after recording a season-high 75 yards while hitting pay dirt twice in the win over Detroit. The 26-year-old has now scored six touchdowns across his last six appearances, placing him firmly on the map as a starting fantasy option for the second half of the season. Fantasy managers should continue riding the hot hand as Parkinson prepares to face his former club in a road matchup against Seattle on Thursday Night Football in Week 16.
</div>

### 🟢 Jordan Mason (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Mason played 36 percent of the offensive snaps in Week 15, again working behind Aaron Jones (58 percent), who was also quiet versus Dallas with just 12 carries for 34 yards. While Mason was not targeted a single time, Jones continues to contribute as a pass-catcher, securing all three of his targets for 31 yards. Mason warrants less fantasy consideration than Jones, and neither are necessarily in the mix as more than flex options, but both RBs will face a plus matchup on the road against the Giants in Week 16.
</div>

### 🟢 Kenneth Gainwell (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Gainwell surprised national viewers by finishing Monday Night Football as the game's leading rusher ahead of Miami's De'Von Achane (12-60-0). The 26-year-old Gainwell reached double-digit carries for just the third time this season, with Week 15's surplus coming at the expense of starter Jaylen Warren (12-33-0), who was playing through an illness. Gainwell's rushing production is too volatile to rely on consistently in standard fantasy formats, but his 4.1 catches per game make him a viable PPR option for Sunday's tilt against the Lions.
</div>

### 🟢 Darnell Washington (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Washington was able to clear concussion protocol and play Monday after sustaining a concussion in Week 14 against the Ravens. The tight end was able to secure multiple passes for the fourth time in five games and the eighth time overall this year. Washington has now caught 26 of 37 targets for 288 yards and a touchdown over 14 contests this season.
</div>

### 🟢 Jacory Croskey-Merritt (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> With Chris Rodriguez (groin) ruled out, Croskey-Merritt led the Commanders backfield in touches with 18 to Jeremy McNichols' 10, and the rookie RB turned that season-high volume into his best performance -- and first trip to the end zone -- since Week 5. The strong effort may push Croskey-Merritt back into a more prominent role in the offense even after Rodriguez returns, but his fantasy appeal will hinge on the more experienced back's health in Week 16 against the Eagles.
