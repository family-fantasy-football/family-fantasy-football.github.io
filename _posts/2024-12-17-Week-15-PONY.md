## Player Report

#### James Conner (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Conner was the star on offense for Arizona on Sunday, punching in a pair of short touchdowns while cracking the century mark in rushing yards for the fifth time this season. The bruising tailback combined for 21 touches, finishing well ahead of backup Trey Benson's five against New England. Conner remains the bell cow for a 7-7 Cardinals squad that will hit the road in Week 16 to face Carolina next Sunday.
#### Rashod Bateman (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Bateman recorded a team-high receiving yardage total while also coming down with multiple touchdown catches for the first time in his career. The fourth-year pro managed 49- and 20-yard scoring grabs in the second quarter, leading him to his best yardage tally since Week 7. Bateman will aim to put together a successful encore at the expense of the division-rival Steelers in a Week 16 Saturday afternoon matchup.
#### Khalil Shakir (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Shakir paced the Bills in receptions and tied for the team lead in targets while scoring a touchdown for the second straight game on a three-yard grab late in the third quarter. Shakir has at least five catches in six of the last seven games, affording him a solid PPR floor heading into a Week 16 home matchup against the Patriots.
#### Adam Thielen (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The Panthers couldn't get their passing attack on track, with the only explosive play being an 83-yard touchdown pass to Jalen Coker. Thus, despite leading the team in targets and receptions, Thielen turned in a modest performance. Positively, he should remain Bryce Young's top target, though the overall state of the Carolina offense may lead to inconsistent results.
#### Jameis Winston (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Prior to yielding QB duties to Thompson-Robinson midway through the final quarter, Winston completed 16 of 25 passes for 146 yards, no touchdowns and three interceptions, was sacked five times for a combined loss of 37 yards and had two carries for minus-2 yards. On the Browns' only score, Winston handed the ball off to Jerome Ford, who did the rest of the work on a 62-yard TD. Thompson-Robinson didn't fare better than Winston on his two possessions: 4-for-9 passing for 18 yards and a pick and three rushes for 16 yards. It's unclear when Stefanski may make a call between the two ahead of next Sunday's game at Cincinnati, but Winston seems to be in danger of getting benched, at least in the short term.
#### Jahmyr Gibbs (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Gibbs piled up 114 yards from scrimmage and two touchdowns during Sunday's loss to Buffalo, a contest in which Detroit was forced to play from behind and adopt a pass-heavy approach. Montgomery's MCL injury seems to have also factored into Gibbs' elevated role, rather than the two operating in a fairly even timeshare, as per usual. Now, with Montgomery potentially in danger of missing the remainder of the 2024 campaign, per Ian Rapoport of NFL Network, Gibbs seems to be facing a clear path to workhorse opportunities down the stretch, making him matchup-proof. Gibbs hasn't required a hefty workload in order to produce this season, but with Craig Reynolds and Sione Vaki now positioned as his top complementary options, he's the Lions' clear No. 1 RB heading into a road matchup against the Bears in Week 16.
#### Nico Collins (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Collins' receiving yardage total was easily his lowest of the season, but the ultra-talented receiver salvaged his fantasy day with a pair of six-yard touchdown catches. He has at least four receptions in four consecutive games, but if there's any quibble with his body of work, it's the fact he has just one 100-yard performance in his last five games, which occurred Week 13 against the lowly Jaguars. Collins will look to boost his non-TD production back up in a Week 16 Saturday afternoon clash on the road with the Chiefs.
#### Brian Thomas Jr. (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** Thomas has proven capable of overcoming mediocre quarterback play as a rookie, accounting for both of Mac Jones' touchdown passes in this latest Jacksonville loss. The 23rd overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft capped the opening drive with a three-yard touchdown catch and added a go-ahead 19-yard touchdown reception with 10:58 remaining in the fourth. Thomas topped 100 receiving yards for just the second time while posting the first multi-touchdown performance of his young career. He'll take a streak of four consecutive games with at least 76 receiving yards into a Week 16 trip to Vegas.
#### Sincere McCormick (RB)
**Injury Status:** Questionable <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** McCormick was injured on a one-yard carry in the second quarter. He was deemed questionable to return ahead of Las Vegas' next offensive drive, then ruled out after halftime. McCormick logged eight yards on seven carries along with 17 yards on two receptions prior to exiting. The Raiders backfield will consist of Alexander Mattison, Ameer Abdullah and Dylan Laube for the remainder of the game.
#### Kyren Williams (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Williams accomplished the unlikely feat of recording 29 rush attempts for the second time in a four-day span, a testament to his ability to handle a true workhorse role while remaining productive. The third-year pro posted a new season-high single-game rushing yardage total in the process, as well as his third 100-yard effort of the campaign. Williams now will have some much-needed extra down time ahead of a Week 16 road battle against the Jets on Sunday, Dec. 22.
#### Juwan Johnson (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Johnson caught two passes from quarterback Spencer Rattler in the second half. The rookie signal-caller took over from Jake Haener, who was benched after the Saints went scoreless in the first half. Johnson had a chance to secure a comeback win after fellow tight end Foster Moreau caught a one-yard touchdown as time expired in the fourth quarter,  but Johnson failed to connect with Rattler on the ensuing two-point conversion attempt. Johnson had caught a touchdown pass in two of the previous three games, but he and Moreau have continued to negate one another fantasy's relevance by splitting snaps and targets. This will likely remain the case during next week's road contest at Green Bay on Monday, Dec. 23.
#### Tyrone Tracy Jr. (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Tracy predictably saw only a modest amount of opportunity in a game that eventually got away from the Giants as expected. The rookie running back now has four straight sub-50-yard totals on the ground, and his receiving production Sunday was his lowest since Week 10. Tracy should have a good chance of bouncing back in a favorable Week 16 road matchup against the Falcons, although it bears noting he outpaced backfield mate Devin Singletary by only two carries Sunday.
#### Jalen Hurts (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** QB <br>
**Details:** The effectiveness of the Eagles' passing attack was in question throughout the week, as Hurts had failed to top 200 passing yards in three straight games. He silenced those questions in an excellent Week 15 showing by averaging 9.1 yards per attempt while completing six passes of at least 20 yards. Hurts also threw for multiple touchdowns for only the sixth time this season, while supplementing it with his 14th rushing score of the campaign. All of that production came despite playing through a broken finger, an injury that Hurts confirmed after the game, per  Jeff McLane of The Philadelphia Inquirer.
#### Deebo Samuel Sr. (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** The biggest play of Samuel's night came on the 41-yard kickoff return he rattled off to start the 49ers' final possession, and the horse collar tackle he was brought down with tacked on an additional 15 yards. His work on offense once again was highly underwhelming, however, and he's now finished with 22 receiving yards or fewer in five straight contests. Samuel's next opportunity to reverse his fortunes comes in a Week 16 road battle against the Dolphins on Sunday, Dec. 22.
#### Isaac Guerendo (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB/WR/TE <br>
**Details:** Guerendo overcame the foot sprain he'd suffered in the Week 14 win over the Bears on Sunday to suit up and handle all of San Francisco's running back touches. However, the rookie surprisingly found some tough sledding against a Rams defense that has been beatable on the ground at times this season. Nevertheless, Guerendo impressively handled a solid workload in wet conditions and finished as the co-leader in receptions as well, and he'll have a secure fantasy floor as the clear lead back when the 49ers travel to face the Dolphins on Sunday, Dec. 22.
#### Cade Otton (TE)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** TE <br>
**Details:** Starting wideouts Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan combined for 14 receptions, 238 yards and three touchdown catches, leaving little else for the rest of Tampa Bay's air attack. That included Otton, who posted his lowest yardage total since Week 6 and tied his second-lowest target tally of the campaign as well. Nevertheless, the third-year tight end remains an important complementary part of the passing game and could see an uptick in work during a favorable Week 16 road matchup against the Cowboys.
#### Terry McLaurin (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** McLaurin teamed up with quarterback Jayden Daniels to score both of Washington's touchdowns on the day. It was Scary Terry's second consecutive game with multiple trips to the end zone, and his fourth overall this season (11 total touchdowns). The 28-year-old is just 31 yards shy of recording his fifth 1,000-yard campaign in his sixth season with the Commanders. McLaurin should accomplish the feat with ease in a pivotal matchup against the Eagles next Sunday.
#### Jayden Daniels (QB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** OP <br>
**Details:** Daniels picked apart the opposition by completing 81 percent of his passes while using his legs to extend multiple drives in Sunday's one-point victory. The promising rookie recorded his fourth game with multiple touchdowns and no turnovers through 14 starts as a pro. As of the conclusion of this game, the 9-5 Commanders still have an outside shot at the NFC East title, so expect inspired play from Daniels against the first-place Eagles next Sunday.
