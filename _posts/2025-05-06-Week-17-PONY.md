## Player Report

#### Rashod Bateman (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** 
#### Adam Thielen (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Thielen said in early February that he wants to play for at least one more season, and he'll be able to do that as he returns for a third campaign in Carolina on a revised contract. The veteran wideout's 48 catches and 615 yards last season were his fewest since 2019, but he played in only 10 games due to a hamstring injury and still managed to catch five touchdowns. Despite the missed time, Thielen led Carolina in both receiving yards and receiving touchdowns last season, and he'll likely continue to be a top target for up-and-coming quarterback Bryce Young in 2025.
#### Brian Thomas Jr. (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** That much is clear; the real question is who else will catch passes from Trevor Lawrence on a regular basis. WR Christian Kirk (collarbone) and TE Evan Engram (shoulder) both are entering contract years without any guaranteed money remaining on their contracts, and WR Gabe Davis (knee) is coming off a disappointing season that ended early due to a meniscus tear. Thomas may be at the level already where competition doesn't really matter and teammates are competing with each other for targets rather than him. He closed 2024 with one of the most productive stretches ever seen from a rookie wide receiver while catching passes from backup QB Mac Jones, posting six straight games with at least 10 targets and 76 yards while averaging 7.5 receptions for 99.8 yards and 0.83 TDs. Similar output over the course of a full season is unlikely even for a player with Thomas' rare combination of size, speed and agility, but it isn't entirely out of the question under Coen, whose lone year as Tampa Bay's offensive coordinator coincided with the top PPR scoring average of Chris Godwin's career (19.7 per game) as well as Mike Evans' best average (17.2) since 2019.
#### Kyren Williams (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** RB <br>
**Details:** Williams has been a polarizing player in the fantasy sphere since his 2023 breakout, and that's unlikely to change after he dipped to 4.1 YPC in 2024 while fumbling six times (including once in the playoffs). He otherwise had another big year, ranking third in carries per game (19.8), sixth in rushing yards per game (81.2) and tied for fifth in rushing touchdowns (14), giving him 26 rushing scores and five receiving TDs in 38 regular-season games over the past two seasons. Blake Corum, a 2024 third-round pick, never made a serious push to threaten Williams last season, and it sounds like the Rams would rather give Williams a contract extension than search for his replacement. Snead said he's already exchanged initial contract terms with agent Drew Rosenhaus.
#### Tyrone Tracy Jr. (RB)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Taken 166th overall a year earlier, Tracy never looked back after Singletary's groin injury opened up a starting job Week 5. Tracy started 12 of 13 games from that point forward and averaged 4.4 YPC for the season, despite being stuck in a brutal offense, with the main negatives being five fumbles and five drops. He's the favorite to start Week 1, but it may be an open competition this summer, considering Singletary has a respectable track record as an NFL starter and Skattebo exploded for 2,316 yards from scrimmage at Arizona State last year. Speed is the obvious advantage for Tracy, a former college wideout who ran a 4.48 40 at 5-foot-11, 209 pounds. Singletary ran a 4.66 before he was drafted six years ago, and Skattebo was timed around 4.6 or 4.65 at his pro day this spring.
#### Terry McLaurin (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** WR <br>
**Details:** McLaurin has one season remaining on the three-year, $68.2 million extension he signed in 2022, with $19 million to $20 million in real-money compensation for 2025. That might be enough to prevent a holdout, but the Commanders would rather lock him in for multiple years after McLaurin finished 2024 with career highs for touchdowns (13), catch rate (70.2 percent) and PPR points per game (15.9). Tough as it may be to avoid TD regression, McLaurin figures to remain highly efficient and may even get a slight boost to his target volume, entering his second season in an offense led by QB Jayden Daniels and OC Kliff Kingsbury. Offseason acquisition Deebo Samuel should mostly get touches/targets that went to Olamide Zaccheaus, Dyami Brown and Noah Brown last year, including many of the screens that were a frequent feature of Kingsbury's offense. McLaurin remains unchallenged as the team's top threat to catch deep and intermediate passes.
#### Deebo Samuel Sr. (WR)
**Injury Status:** Active <br>
**Lineup Slot:** BE <br>
**Details:** Samuel's reworked contract seems mutually beneficial, as it provides him with new incentives and a stronger baseline for 2025, while likely lessening Washington's commitment beyond the coming season. He previously had a $16.6 million non-guaranteed salary for 2025. Coming off a lackluster 2024 campaign in San Francisco, the 29-year-old playmaker will work to reignite his career while lining up alongside reigning second-team All-Pro selection Terry McLaurin. Samuel's versatility will make him a strong fit for offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury's scheme, as long as he can regain some of the dynamic abilities he showcased during his prime years in San Francisco. He recorded just 51 catches (on 81 targets) for 670 yards and three scores and added 136 yards and a touchdown on 42 carries over 15 appearances during his final season with the 49ers.
