## 🏥 Player Report

### 🟢 Bam Knight (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Knight overcame a minor ankle injury in order to serve as the Cardinals' lead back sans Trey Benson (knee) and Emari Demercado (ankle). The 24-year-old Knight struggled with his efficiency yet again, but he managed to reward committed fantasy managers by punching in Arizona's only rushing score of the contest. Backup Michael Carter (5-28-0) finished as the team's leading rusher on half as many carries as Knight received, as the team continues to deploy multiple backs to help replace the early-season loss of James Conner (ankle). It will be important to monitor both Benson's and Demercado's status prior to next Sunday's tilt against Tampa Bay, as the return of either tailback could noticeably eat into Knight's potential workload in Week 13. It is also worth noting that Knight appeared to be tending to a lower leg injury late in Sunday's loss, so he may pop back up on the injury report early in the upcoming practice week.
</div>

### 🟢 Tyler Allgeier (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Allgeier received the most carries he has seen in a game since Week 4, but the increased workload did not translate to increased fantasy production. The talented backup had scored thrice over his last two appearances, but he has also been held to five or fewer carries in four out of his last six, highlighting the risk that comes with fantasy managers deploying him in his current role. Allgeier feels like a premium touchdown-dependent asset against the Jets in Week 13 for those in deeper leagues or those looking to replace a player on a bye.
</div>

### 🟢 David Njoku (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> For the second straight game, Njoku was on the field for fewer snaps than rookie tight end Harold Fannin (46), but this time the disparity was far more pronounced than it was last week. The only other game in which the veteran tight end was outplayed by Fannin to this degree was when Njoku suffered an injury in a Week 6 loss to Pittsburgh. Since the club's Week 9 bye, Njoku has just three receptions on four targets for 28 yards over three games, but he still leads the club with three TD catches for the season. Cleveland's anemic passing offense, which was slightly improved under Shedeur Sanders on Sunday, still relies on a lot of short throws, which benefits both TEs.
</div>

### 🟢 Evan Engram (TE)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Engram has yet to hit 50 yards receiving in a game this season and is playing less than 50 percent of the offensive snaps, as Adam Trautman is coach Sean Payton's preferred blocking tight end on early downs. Through 10 games, Engram has just 32 catches for 260 yards and one touchdown on 50 targets. He's not a recommended fantasy starter at tight end down the stretch as the Broncos head into their Week 12 bye.
</div>

### 🔴 Joe Mixon (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Out<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> NFL.com's Ian Rapoport reported that Mixon is not expected to return this season, prompting the running back to clap back. "Now, I get everyone's looking for splash news &amp; clickbait... but I'm just curious, Ian how do you know more about me than me?," Mixon responded. The report adds that two sources told the Houston Chronicle that the team holds out hope the running back's foot responds to treatment, but added he was not expected to play in 2025. Mixon has been on the reserve/non-football injury list all season, and in his ongoing absence, Woody Marks (115 carries) and Nick Chubb (105 carries) have handled the bulk of the rushing duties for the 6-5 Texans.
</div>

### 🟡 Brian Thomas Jr. (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
</div>

### 🟢 Isiah Pacheco (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Pacheco has been sidelined since Week 8 with a sprained MCL but returned to practice ahead of Kansas City's Week 12 matchup against the Colts. He logged an additional estimated full practice Monday, which seemingly sets him up to return on Thanksgiving afternoon against the Cowboys. However, a short week complicates his outlook a bit. Even if he is active, Pacheco would likely still be in a split backfield with Kareem Hunt, who has operated as the primary back in Pacheco's absence.
</div>

### 🟡 Rashee Rice (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Rice took full advantage of his 12 targets during Sunday's overtime win versus the Colts, turning them into eight catches for 141 yards and no touchdowns. He, along with fellow WR Xavier Worthy (ankle, LP on Monday), are tending to injuries afterward, but the pair will have two more opportunities to prove their respective levels of health in advance of Thursday's game at Dallas.
</div>

### 🟢 Ladd McConkey (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> McConkey had a forgettable afternoon in a shockingly lopsided loss for the Chargers that saw Justin Herbert pulled early after throwing for only 81 yards and an interception. McConkey's yardage total was his second lowest of the season, and it snapped a five-game streak of 55-plus receiving-yard efforts. The ugly afternoon for the air attack was a clear outlier, so McConkey is a good bounce-back candidate in a Week 13 home matchup against the Raiders on Sunday, Nov. 30 following a Week 12 bye.
</div>

### 🟢 De'Von Achane (RB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Achane put together a signature two-way performance, repeatedly picking up meaningful yardage on the ground while recording a game-long run of a relatively modest 23 yards. The speedy third-year pro did get evaluated for a possible back injury in the fourth quarter, but he was able to return to the game and handled all three carries on the Dolphins' game-winning drive to set up Riley Patterson's 29-yard field goal. Achane now has back-to-back 100-yard efforts on the ground for the first time this season, and he's recorded at least five catches in four consecutive contests heading into a Week 13 home matchup against the Saints on Sunday, Nov. 30.
</div>

### 🟢 Darius Slayton (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Slayton announced his return from a one-game absence due to a hamstring injury with a 23-yard catch on the game's first play, but he didn't catch his only other target the rest of the way. Jameis Winston threw for 366 yards, but Wan'Dale Robinson was Winston's go-to receiver, as Robinson caught nine of 14 targets for 156 yards and a touchdown. Slayton has yet to score a touchdown heading into a Week 13 road game against the Patriots, and he has topped 60 receiving yards only three times, though two of those three games came in Slayton's last two outings prior to his hamstring injury.
</div>

### 🟢 Wan'Dale Robinson (WR)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Robinson got behind the defense for a 39-yard touchdown catch on a flea flicker to cap the opening drive. That score was part of a sensational first quarter that also included a 40-yard reception and the NFL's version of an NBA and-one, on which Robinson held on for a 15-yard catch that also drew an unnecessary roughness penalty on Brian Branch. Robinson caught all four of his first-quarter targets for 106 yards and a touchdown, then tacked on five catches for 50 yards on 10 targets the rest of the way. He has drawn 45 targets over the past four games, so Robinson should continue to see plenty of volume against the Patriots in Week 13, regardless of whether Winston or Jaxson Dart (concussion) starts under center for the Giants.
</div>

### 🟢 Tyrod Taylor (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Active<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Taylor made his second start of the season, this time as a result of Justin Fields being benched. Taylor connected with John Metchie for a 13-yard touchdown in the second quarter, and Taylor's interception came on a meaningless deep heave on the game's final play. The Jets' passing game was noticeably more effective with Taylor after Fields threw for 116 yards or fewer in four of his last five starts prior to losing his starting role. While the team's quarterback situation remains fluid heading into a Week 13 home game against the Falcons, Taylor likely cleared the low bar needed to earn another start.
</div>

### 🟡 Baker Mayfield (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> Per Rick Stroud of the Tampa Bay Times, whether Mayfield will be able to play this coming Sunday against the Cardinals figures to come down to pain management, but either way, the QB's MRI results indicate that his shoulder issue is not viewed as a long-term concern, per Jeremy Fowler of ESPN.com. If Mayfield isn't cleared for Week 13 action, however, Teddy Bridgewater would be in line to fill in for him this weekend.
</div>

### 🟡 Jayden Daniels (QB)

<div style='padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;'>
<strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br>
<strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br>
<strong>Details:</strong> questionable
