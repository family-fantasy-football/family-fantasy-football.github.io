</code></pre> <hr> <h2 id="-player-report">🏥 Player Report</h2> <h3 id="-trey-benson-rb">🟢 Trey Benson (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Injured Reserve<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Benson had his 21-day practice window opened in late November, and he initially managed limited on-field activity before being downgraded to consistent non-participant status. Instead, Bam Knight, Emari Demercado (ankle) and Michael Carter will handle Arizona's backfield reps for the remainder of the 2025 campaign. Carter, a 2024 third-round pick, had initially seemed primed for a substantial opportunity after starting running back James Conner (foot) went down to season-ending injury Week 3. Ultimately, Benson's durability concerns make his expected role murky for the 2026 season, which will be the last year of Conner's contract with the Cardinals. </div> <h3 id="-drake-london-wr">🟡 Drake London (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> London has missed four consecutive games due to a PCL sprain in his left knee, in which span he hasn't practiced. Morris indicated that handling on-field activity will be crucial for London to return Week 16, meaning his status at Wednesday's practice will need to be monitored closely. In London's absence during last week's win over the Buccaneers on Thursday Night Football, TE Kyle Pitts broke out for a career-best 11-166-3 line on 12 targets. If the No. 1 wideout does manage to retake the field on the road versus Arizona this weekend, however, London will figure to immediately resume operating as Kirk Cousins' top target in the passing game. </div> <h3 id="-justice-hill-rb">🟢 Justice Hill (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Injured Reserve<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Hill was apparently injured in practice last week and was placed on injured reserve ahead of last Thursday night's game against the Bengals. He'll miss at least three more contests while on IR, but it sounds like he'll have a chance to return when eligible Week 17. Keaton Mitchell and Rasheen Ali will continue to handle backup duties behind Derrick Henry for the next few weeks. </div> <h3 id="-joshua-palmer-wr">🟢 Joshua Palmer (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Palmer was held to one catch for the first time since Week 3, though he's yet to exceed two receptions in a contest since Week 1. The wide receiver finished fourth on the team in receiving yards, while his two targets were his fewest since returning from an ankle injury in Week 11. Palmer will look to be more involved in the team's matchup with the Browns on Dec. 21. </div> <h3 id="-courtland-sutton-wr">🟢 Courtland Sutton (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> The Broncos have spread targets around for much of the season, but Sutton was the key pass catcher in Sunday's win. He led the team with 10 targets, his fourth time hitting that mark this season. Sutton delivered several splash plays with that opportunity, including gains of 42 and 26 yards as well as a 14-yard touchdown reception. That helped him top 100 receiving yards for the first time since Week 3 while falling only five yards short of his season high. </div> <h3 id="-jakobi-meyers-wr">🟢 Jakobi Meyers (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Meyers saw his touchdown streak end at three games, but he remained heavily involved, tying Brian Thomas for the team lead in targets while finishing two receiving yards shy of Travis Etienne's team-high total. Meyers is locked in as a key piece of a surging Jaguars offense that has averaged 33.3 points in six games since acquiring the veteran wide receiver in a trade with the Raiders. Denver's elite defense will try to slow Meyers and the Jaguars down in Week 16. </div> <h3 id="-trevor-lawrence-qb">🟢 Trevor Lawrence (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Lawrence set a new career high with five touchdown passes as the Jaguars cruised to a fifth consecutive win. He led touchdown drives on each of Jacksonville's first three possessions, sandwiching his 15-yard touchdown run between touchdown passes of four yards to Brian Thomas and 16 yards to Bhayshul Tuten. The surging quarterback tacked on touchdown passes of 20 yards, eight yards and 45 yards to Travis Etienne. Lawrence has thrown multiple touchdown passes in four consecutive games, while the Jaguars have scored at least 25 points in seven straight since their bye, but extending those streaks won't be easy in Week 16 on the road against Denver's elite defense. </div> <h3 id="-hollywood-brown-wr">🟡 Hollywood Brown (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable </div> <h3 id="-aaron-jones-sr-rb">🟢 Aaron Jones Sr. (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Jones has been limited in recent practice weeks with a nagging shoulder injury picked up back in Week 9, but it has yet to affect the veteran's workload or status once game days roll around. Backup Jordan Mason (10-29-0) continues to split backfield duties with Jones, giving both runners modest fantasy value as flex options on a weekly basis. It wouldn't be surprising to see Jones limited in practice again in Week 16, but managers should prepare to deploy Minnesota's veteran starter in a plus matchup against the Giants next Sunday. </div> <h3 id="-saquon-barkley-rb">🟢 Saquon Barkley (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> As his final line indicates, Barkley had to work for his yards Sunday, but the star back was effective in churning out some productive gains and recorded his sixth rushing touchdown of the campaign on a two-yard run with just under two minutes remaining in the first half. Barkley now has logged 20 or more carries and scored a rushing touchdown in consecutive games for only the second time this season, affording him some momentum heading into a favorable Week 16 road matchup against the Commanders on Saturday afternoon. </div> <h3 id="-george-kittle-te">🟢 George Kittle (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Kittle set a new single-game high in receiving yards (88) for 2025 on his second-highest reception total (eight) through nine healthy starts. The star tight end has been efficient with his 54 targets, producing a strong 83.3 percent catch rate so far this season. Kittle's season totals may end up suffering due to missed time to injury, but he remains one of the tight top ends in fantasy when he is on the field. </div> <h3 id="-brock-purdy-qb">🟢 Brock Purdy (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br> <strong>Details:</strong> The 49ers' Week 14 bye did Purdy wonders. In addition to allowing the quarterback's body to gain strength after returning from injury just weeks prior, it also afforded the coaching staff an extra week to game plan against an inferior opponent. The end result Sunday was the 25-year-old's finest fantasy outing to date in 2025. Purdy will face a stiffer test on the road against the Colts next Monday, but his fantasy arrow is pointing up for Week 16. </div> <h3 id="-rashid-shaheed-wr">🟢 Rashid Shaheed (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Shaheed left his mark across the final box score with another well-balanced effort on both offense and special teams. The trade-deadline acquisition struggled out of the gates with Seattle, but he has settled in nicely over his last two games with averages of 4.5 receptions, 70.5 receiving yards and 142.5 return yards. Shaheed's increased usage puts him on the map as a flex option against the Rams on Thursday Night Football in Week 16. </div> <h3 id="-tony-pollard-rb">🟢 Tony Pollard (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Pollard has struggled for most of the season, but he managed his second consecutive 100-yard performance on the ground in Sunday's loss. He recorded two rushes of at least 20 yards, and he also capped off a scoring drive late in the game with a six-yard plunge into the end zone. After totaling only two scores in his first 12 matchups of the campaign, Pollard has three combined across his last two contests. </div> <h3 id="-zach-ertz-te">🟢 Zach Ertz (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Injured Reserve<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Ertz will officially miss the remainder of the 2025 season after suffering an ACL tear during Washington's 31-0 loss to the Vikings in Week 14. In his stead, reps at the tight end position are slated to be split between John Bates, Ben Sinnott and Colson Yankoff. Ertz is slated to become an unrestricted free agent this offseason.
