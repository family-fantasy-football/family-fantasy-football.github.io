</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="trey-mcbride-te">Trey McBride (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> McBride led the Cardinals in receptions and targets while finishing second to Marvin Harrison in receiving yards. The star tight end has topped out at a relatively modest 78 receiving yards over the first four games, but he hasn’t recorded less than five catches or logged fewer than seven targets in any contest. McBride’s production has been arguably capped to an extent by Kyler Murray’s uneven play under center, yet the former could have a good opportunity for his first breakout game of 2025 when Arizona hosts the struggling Titans in a Week 5 interconference clash on Sunday, Oct. 5.</p> <h4 id="deandre-hopkins-wr">DeAndre Hopkins (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Hopkins was a complete non-factor Sunday, failing to record a single catch while playing just 18 of the Ravens’ 54 offensive snaps. The veteran wideout’s one target was his lowest total of the season after seeing two targets in each of the first three games. Despite his stature as a five-time Pro Bowl selection, Hopkins isn’t seeing consistent enough volume to be relied to be relied upon for fantasy purposes.</p> <h4 id="chuba-hubbard-rb">Chuba Hubbard (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Hubbard’s rushing opportunities were unsurprisingly limited in the lopsided loss, but he made good use of them on his way to a team-high yardage total on the ground. The fifth-year pro’s carry total tied for his lowest of the season, and he’s now posted multiple receptions in all four contests to date in 2025. Hubbard should have a better chance at more rushing volume in a Week 5 home matchup against the Dolphins next Sunday afternoon, a game Miami’s suspect defense will play on a short week.</p> <h4 id="jamarr-chase-wr">Ja’Marr Chase (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Chase led the Bengals in receptions, but on a night when Jake Browning threw for only 125 yards, that slotting didn’t come close to leading to any meaningful fantasy production. Chase has recorded 10 receptions in his first two full games with Browning as his quarterback, but he’s averaging only 7.3 yards per reception in that span, with only one of those catches going for 20-plus yards. If Browning remains under center for a Week 5 home matchup against the Lions, Chase will be hard to trust against a talented Detroit defense irrespective of his upside.</p> <h4 id="david-montgomery-rb">David Montgomery (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> The game script set up well for Montgomery, as the Lions led by multiple scores for nearly the entire second half. However, Jahmyr Gibbs out-touched him 17-9, and Montgomery was stymied even when he did get opportunities. His longest rush went for only four yards, and he failed to reach 20 rushing yards for only the third time in his 32 games with the Lions.</p> <h4 id="dalton-schultz-te">Dalton Schultz (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Schultz tied for the team lead in targets with Nico Collins, though he was used entirely in short areas of the field. The tight end’s longest reception went for only nine yards, and he has yet to record a 20-yard gain on any of his 16 catches this season. Schultz has also yet to reach 40 receiving yards in a game.</p> <h4 id="josh-downs-wr">Josh Downs (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Downs was third among receivers/tight ends for targets after Michael Pittman (10) and Tyler Warren (six). Warren has become a focus in the intermediate passing game, which may limit Downs’ upside.</p> <h4 id="travis-etienne-jr-rb">Travis Etienne Jr. (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Etienne produced his finest fantasy score of the season after gashing the 49ers’ defense for a 48-yard touchdown on the first play following a turnover at the start of the second quarter. The 26-year-old did not let up from there, taking 19 of the 23 carries the Jaguars allotted to running backs for his second 100-plus yard rushing game of the season. After falling out of favor in 2024, Etienne has reclaimed the Jaguars’ starting job under new head coach Liam Coen on efficiency (6.1 YPC) we haven’t seen since his impressive rookie campaign in 2021. Jacksonville faces a tough Kansas City defense on Monday Night Football in Week 5, but Etienne’s early success this season makes him a must-start asset.</p> <h4 id="matthew-stafford-qb">Matthew Stafford (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Stafford pulled a vintage performance out of his bag of tricks Sunday, producing a stat line we haven’t seen regularly since his prime years in Detroit. The Rams’ offense hit the skids in the second half, resulting in a five-drive stretch that produced four consecutive three-and-outs followed by a Kyren Williams’ fumble. That’s when Stafford took it upon himself to lead an 11-play, 90-yard touchdown drive, immediately following it up with an 88-yard huge play to Tutu Atwell on the ensuing possession to seal the win for Los Angeles. The 37-year-old is proving that he still has plenty left in the tank by throwing for 1,114 yards and eight touchdowns to two interceptions through four starts in 2025. Up next for Stafford is a home matchup on a short week against the 49ers on Thursday Night Football in Week 5.</p> <h4 id="rhamondre-stevenson-rb">Rhamondre Stevenson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Stevenson outpaced TreVeyon Henderson (seven) and Antonio Gibson (six) in carries despite his Week 3 fumbling nightmare, as head coach Mike Vrabel held true to his word about not dinging Stevenson’s workload. Sunday’s game script also allowed New England to take a ground-centric approach due to its large lead. Stevenson appears to still be the top option – albeit by a thin margin – in a three-man committee heading into a Week 5 road showdown against the Bills next Sunday night.</p> <h4 id="spencer-rattler-qb">Spencer Rattler (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Rattler attempted fewer than 34 passes and threw for under 200 yards for the first time this season. The second-year quarterback has been underwhelming despite averaging 39.7 passing attempts through the first three regular-season games. Sunday’s outing also marked the first time this season that the Saints have had more rushing attempts (34) than passing attempts (28). Rattler’s production may suffer again if the Saints lean into the running game during their Week 5 matchup against the Giants, whose defense has allowed a league-worst 6.1 yards per carry.</p> <h4 id="aj-brown-wr">A.J. Brown (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br> <strong>Details:</strong> After coming to life with a 6-109-1 line against the Rams in Week 3, Brown’s production slumped again. The veteran wideout’s yardage total was a new season low and his second single-digit yardage figure over the first four games of 2025. Jalen Hurts did try to get the ball in Brown’s hands however, and he has 27 targets in his last three contests. Brown could struggle once again to build momentum as the Broncos’ suffocating secondary comes to town next Sunday afternoon for a tough Week 5 matchup.</p> <h4 id="brian-robinson-jr-rb">Brian Robinson Jr. (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Robinson logged only two more snaps on offense (eight) than he did Week 3, but he finished with three more carries Sunday than the two he received against Arizona. Christian McCaffrey continued to dominate San Francisco’s backfield usage, taking 23 touches for 141 yards from scrimmage and a touchdown in the team’s first loss of the campaign. Robinson is the clear No. 2 behind McCaffrey, but there simply isn’t enough scraps left for another rusher to thrive in this offense. The 26-year-old Robinson is not a viable fantasy option for Week 5 when the 49ers face the Rams on Thursday Night Football.</p> <h4 id="cooper-kupp-wr">Cooper Kupp (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Kupp tied Jaxon Smith-Njigba for the team lead in receptions and targets on a night when Sam Darnold spread the ball around to eight different pass catchers overall. However, the veteran wideout averaged just 6.5 yards per catch, but the fact he remains a clear No. 2 option in what is a mostly concentrated air attack will continue to afford Kupp a degree of fantasy value, especially in PPR formats. The veteran wideout will now have some extra time to gear up for a Week 5 home matchup against the Buccaneers on Sunday, Oct. 5.</p> <h4 id="sam-darnold-qb">Sam Darnold (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Darnold extended the strong start to his Seahawks tenure with his second straight interception-less game and third consecutive with at least one touchdown pass. The scoring toss came early, as he connected with AJ Barner for a 16-yard strike late in the first quarter. Darnold didn’t start clicking with top target Jaxon Smith-Njigba until late in the third quarter, but he subsequently hit his No. 1 receiver for several key completions in the final period. The last of those came with 23 seconds remaining, a 22-yard connection that helped position Jason Myers for an eventual game-winning field goal. Darnold will head into a Week 5 home showdown against the Cardinals on Sunday, Oct. 5 with a 70.0 percent completion rate, a 5:2 TD:INT and 38 rushing yards on three attempts across his first four games.</p> <h4 id="jaxon-smith-njigba-wr">Jaxon Smith-Njigba (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Smith-Njigba shockingly didn’t make his first catch until 49 seconds remained in the third quarter, but he’d curiously logged three rush attempts by that point. The talented wideout’s moonlighting came to an end down the stretch, however, as he contributed key receptions of 11, 36 and 22 yards in the fourth quarter. The latter catch positioned the Seahawks at the Cardinals’ 40-yard line with 23 seconds remaining. Jason Myers would knock home a game-winning 52-yard field goal two plays later, and Smith-Njigba finished with a solid stat line after his night looked to be in danger of being a washout. Smith-Njigba has seen his reception and receiving yardage totals drop over that of the previous game in each of the last three contests, but he remains Sam Darnold’s unquestioned No. 1 target heading into a Week 5 home matchup against the Buccaneers on Sunday, Oct. 5.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_4_2025_RRT_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br><br></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_4_2025_RRT_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> </div> </article> <br> <hr> <br> <ul class="list-disc pl-8"></ul> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-10_links/">Week 10 Links</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-11_preview/">Week 11 Matchups Preview</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-10_Recap/">Week 10 League Recap</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-10-EET/">Emma's Excellent Team Week 10 Report</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-10-TIB/">To Infinity and Bijan!
