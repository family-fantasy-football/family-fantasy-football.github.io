</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="khalil-shakir-wr">Khalil Shakir (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Shakir has struggled against a Jets defense with a strong secondary and plenty of weaknesses elsewhere, exceeding 25 receiving yards only once in seven career matchups in the AFC East rivalry. Buffalo’s 2024 leader in receiving yards has a nice opportunity to bounce back Thursday against a Dolphins defense that is allowing 33 points per game.</p> <h4 id="jake-ferguson-te">Jake Ferguson (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> The tight end led the Cowboys in target volume during a wild seesaw affair and tied CeeDee Lamb for the team lead in receptions, although Lamb out-paced him in yards with 112. Ferguson has re-established himself as the main security blanket for Dak Prescott, and while he’s still looking for his first touchdown since he caught three against Green Bay in the wild-card round of the 2023 season, he’s delivered a 14-101-0 line on 18 targets through the first two games of the current campaign. Ferguson could hit paydirt in Week 3 against a Bears defense that just gave up a TD to the Lions’ Brock Wright, one of five touchdowns thrown by Jared Goff in a 52-21 rout.</p> <h4 id="george-pickens-wr">George Pickens (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br> <strong>Details:</strong> While he took a back seat to CeeDee Lamb (9-112-0 on 11 targets) and tight end Jake Ferguson (9-78-0 on 12 targets) in terms of volume, Pickens came up big for the Cowboys with a six-yard TD grab from Dak Prescott with less than a minute left in the fourth quarter that gave the team a 34-30 lead – and which proved to be only the fourth-last score of the afternoon in a wild back-and-forth affair. It was Pickens’ first trip to the end zone for Dallas after a fairly quiet debut, but he could be headed for even bigger numbers in Week 3 against a Bears secondary that just got lit up for four receiving touchdowns by the Lions’ top WR duo of Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jameson Williams.</p> <h4 id="rj-harvey-rb">RJ Harvey (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Harvey made the most of his limited touches in Week 1, but he couldn’t repeat that same effort against the Colts. He was out-touched 15-6 by J.K. Dobbins, and Dobbins was also more effective with the opportunity. Harvey is a strong bench stash and can have productive games early this season, but it appears that will require him to be extremely efficient with limited touches.</p> <h4 id="jahmyr-gibbs-rb">Jahmyr Gibbs (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Although Jared Goff and Amon-Ra St. Brown mostly stole the show in Detroit’s jaw-dropping offensive breakout, Gibbs rather quietly put together a fruitful fantasy performance. The dynamic back outpaced David Montgomery by one carry and 37 rushing yards, with Gibbs’ game-long 42-yard scamper the big difference between the two backfield mates. Gibbs also recorded his first rushing touchdown of the season on a six-yard run in the first quarter, which served to round out his production on a day where he was limited to a mid-level workload. Gibbs will look to navigate a particularly challenging matchup when the Lions travel to Baltimore to face the Ravens in a Week 3 Monday night showdown on Sept. 22.</p> <h4 id="woody-marks-rb">Woody Marks (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Marks was bumped up the depth chart after veteran backup Dameon Pierce was made a healthy scratch ahead of Monday’s kickoff. The 24-year-old Marks responded well by converting his four touches into 51 total yards backing up Nick Chubb (14-72-1 from scrimmage). Marks is unlikely to see his workload increase against the Jaguars on Sunday, but he is a name to keep an eye on if the 0-2 Texans continue to slide and decide to give the rookie an extended look later in the season.</p> <h4 id="daniel-jones-qb">Daniel Jones (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Jones proved his Week 1 performance against Miami was no fluke, as he completed three passes of more than 40 yards while averaging 9.4 yards per attempt. He effectively targeted all of his pass catchers, though Tyler Warren looks to be his favorite of the group. Jones also picked up his third rushing touchdown of the season after falling into the end zone on the second of two consecutive quarterback sneaks at the goal line. Jones has had a strong start to his time with the Colts, as he now has five total touchdowns with no turnovers while averaging 9.3 yards per attempt across two games.</p> <h4 id="michael-pittman-jr-wr">Michael Pittman Jr. (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Pittman took on a lesser role among the Colts’ pass catchers in Week 2, tying for third on the team in targets. He was also limited to receptions in short areas of the field, with his longest gain going for just 12 yards. Tyler Warren appears to have the most consistent pass-catching role in Indianapolis early this season, which could mean inconsistent production for Pittman moving forward given the significant roles of both Josh Downs and Alec Pierce in the offense.</p> <h4 id="bhayshul-tuten-rb">Bhayshul Tuten (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> In his first game without the traded Tank Bigsby on the roster, Tuten served as the clear No. 2 back behind Travis Etienne, logging a relatively modest six fewer carries than his backfield mate. Tuten also struck for his first NFL touchdown through the air, as he recorded an eight-yard scoring grab early in the second quarter. Tuten’s five-carry boost from Week 1 was encouraging and confirmation of his status as the main complementary option to Etienne, and he’ll look to carry over his momentum into a Week 3 home divisional showdown against the Texans next Sunday afternoon.</p> <h4 id="justin-herbert-qb">Justin Herbert (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Herbert took what the defense gave him all evening, and the Raiders never seemed to have an answer. The sixth-year quarterback efficiently marched down the field whenever Los Angeles needed a sustaining drive, and were it not for the ineptitude of Geno Smith and company on the other side, Herbert probably could have pressed further for a bigger game. It’s clear the 27-year-old is looking to be more mobile in 2025, as that’s now back-to-back games with 30 or more rushing yards, a feat he accomplished just four times total last season.</p> <h4 id="davante-adams-wr">Davante Adams (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Adams led the Rams’ pass catchers in targets and receiving yards, thanks in large part to long catches of 33 and 26 yards. He also recorded his first touchdown as a Ram on a 16-yard connection in the back corner of the end zone midway through the fourth quarter. Adams showed strong rapport with Matthew Stafford, which should bode well for his production moving forward, though he and the Rams will face a tough matchup against the Eagles in Week 3.</p> <h4 id="tj-hockenson-te">T.J. Hockenson (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Hockenson caught just 33 percent of his targets in a low-volume night of offense from Minnesota, resulting in a mediocre stat line for fantasy managers. The receiving tight end is averaging just two receptions and 13.5 yards in two games with 2025 starting QB J.J. McCarthy. That is a concerning trend for a player hoping to bounce back from a lackluster 2024 campaign. Hockenson’s next opportunity to right the ship will come in a home game against Cincinnati next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="drake-maye-qb">Drake Maye (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Maye tossed first-quarter touchdown passes of eight yards to Mack Hollins and 16 yards to Kayshon Boutte, then ran in a six-yard touchdown in the third quarter. The 2024 third overall pick has demonstrated consistent playmaking ability with his legs, reaching 30 rushing yards in seven of his first 14 NFL starts. This was only his fifth game with multiple touchdown passes, but Maye tied his career best in completion percentage Sunday, suggesting he’s improving as a passer heading into a Week 3 home game against the Steelers, who have surprisingly allowed 31.5 points per game this season.</p> <h4 id="alvin-kamara-rb">Alvin Kamara (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> After needing a touchdown to salvage his Week 1 performance, Kamara topped 100 scrimmage yards for the first time in 2025 in Week 2. The veteran RB needed volume to get there though, as his longest run went for only 15 yards. Kamara remains the centerpiece of the Saints’ offense under new head coach Kellen Moore, and he could have a big day through the air in Week 3 against a Seahawks defense that has given up 159 combined receiving yards to the Steelers’ Jaylen Warren and the 49ers’ Christian McCaffrey to begin the season.</p> <h4 id="ricky-pearsall-wr">Ricky Pearsall (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> The second-year wideout couldn’t repeat his big Week 1 performance with Mac Jones under center instead of Brock Purdy (toe/shoulder), but Pearsall still delivered solid production while finishing third on the 49ers in volume behind Jauan Jennings (10 targets) and Christian McCaffrey (seven). Purdy is expected to miss multiple weeks, but Pearsall’s involvement in the passing game Sunday suggests there’s little reason to downgrade his outlook while catching passes from Jones. Pearsall could be busy again in Week 3 against the Cardinals.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_2_2025_MMT_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br><br></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_2_2025_MMT_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> </div> </article> <br> <hr> <br> <ul class="list-disc pl-8"></ul> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-14_links/">Week 14 Links</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-15_preview/">Week 15 Matchups Preview</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-14_Recap/">Week 14 League Recap</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-14-TTC/">Third Time's the Charm?
