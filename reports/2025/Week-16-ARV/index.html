</code></pre> <hr> <h2 id="-player-report">🏥 Player Report</h2> <h3 id="-bijan-robinson-rb">🟢 Bijan Robinson (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Robinson split backfield work nearly evenly with backup Tyler Allgeier (16-79-0) in Sunday's road win, but it was the former's work as a receiver that ultimately led to a standout fantasy performance. The 23-year-old Robinson has been generating WR1-type production over Atlanta's last two contests (15-174-1) while reaching double-digit targets in each game. The dual-threat superstar eclipsed the 2,000-yard mark in total yards from scrimmage with Sunday's balanced output. Robinson should continue playing a huge role in the Falcons' late-season boon on offense when the team hosts the Rams for Monday Night Football in Week 17. </div> <h3 id="-xavier-legette-wr">🟢 Xavier Legette (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> The second-year pro has now caught just seven of 13 targets for 74 yards over Carolina's last four contests. He appears to have been passed by Jalen Coker in the Panthers' receiving corps, as the latter has tallied 213 yards and two touchdowns on 14 receptions during that span. Legette remains Carolina's second-leading receiver on the season with 338 yards across 13 appearances, but he's unlikely to carry much fantasy value in the Week 17 matchup against the Seahawks. </div> <h3 id="-colston-loveland-te">🟢 Colston Loveland (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Loveland was expected to take on an even larger role in Chicago's offense due to both Luther Burden (ankle) and Rome Odunze (foot) being sidelined. However, he instead tied for third on the team in targets and finished fourth in yardage. While it was a modest showing, Loveland did manage a pair of key catches on Chicago's game-tying drive late in the third quarter. Loveland should maintain a key role in the offense and have the chance to bounce back in Week 17 against the 49ers. </div> <h3 id="-dylan-sampson-rb">🟡 Dylan Sampson (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Sampson missed Week 16, and the coach is hopeful for a return this coming Sunday against the Steelers. With Quinshon Judkins (leg/ankle) out of action for the remainder of the regular season, the Browns hope to have a full complement of backs available. That includes Sampson, Raheim Sanders and Trayveon Williams. If all are healthy for Week 17, Sampson would be considered the lead back. </div> <h3 id="-bo-nix-qb">🟢 Bo Nix (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br> <strong>Details:</strong> The Broncos played from behind for a large portion of the second half and were down two scores for nearly the entire fourth quarter. That allowed Nix to rack up a career-high 352 passing yards while averaging a solid 7.5 yards per attempt. The primary shortcoming of Nix's performance was that he managed only one touchdown -- a looping 15-yard pass to Courtland Sutton in the back corner of the end zone early in the second quarter. He also threw a key interception midway through the fourth quarter, effectively ending Denver's chance at a comeback victory. Overall, Nix has topped 300 passing yards three times in his last four games, though he has managed multiple passing scores only once in his last six contests. </div> <h3 id="-emanuel-wilson-rb">🟢 Emanuel Wilson (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Wilson was effective throughout the night, and after Josh Jacobs lost a fumble at the Bears' three-yard line in the third quarter, the former handled the rest of Green Bay's non-quarterback rushing opportunities. Wilson's rushing yardage total was his second highest of the season, and he may have earned himself a bigger workload in next Saturday night's home showdown against the Ravens even if Jacobs is healthy enough to play through his knee and ankle injuries. </div> <h3 id="-parker-washington-wr">🟢 Parker Washington (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Washington has been a reliable target for Trevor Lawrence for most of the season, but he stepped up as the team's top pass catcher in Sunday's win. His longest gain of the day came late in the third quarter, when he caught a short pass and then split a pair of defenders before cutting upfield for 63 yards. Washington also chipped in additional long gains of 24, 21 and 20 yards on top of a 12-yard touchdown to record his highest yardage total in a matchup. He now has at least 70 receiving yards in three of his last seven games while scoring three times in that span. </div> <h3 id="-geno-smith-qb">🟢 Geno Smith (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Smith returned from a one-game absence and nearly led the Raiders to an unexpected victory against one of the toughest defensive units in the league. The veteran signal-caller threw multiple touchdown passes for the fifth time in 14 starts with Las Vegas, highlighting his underwhelming play since becoming the team's starter this past offseason. Despite his overall struggles, Smith performed well in his return from injury and could be a sneaky fantasy play in deeper formats against an inconsistent Giants defense next Sunday. </div> <h3 id="-kyren-williams-rb">🟢 Kyren Williams (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Williams put in a workmanlike performance that saw him hit the 70-yard threshold on the ground for the fourth straight game and seventh in the last eight contests overall. However, Williams also saw backfield mate Blake Corum draw a red-zone rushing opportunity at the one-yard line in the third quarter that he converted into a touchdown. Williams saw a three-game scoring streak snapped Thursday, but he remains the clear lead back going into a Week 17 road matchup against the Falcons on Monday night, Dec. 29. </div> <h3 id="-puka-nacua-wr">🟢 Puka Nacua (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Nacua was involved even more than usual due to Davante Adams' (knee/hamstring) inactive status, and the former delivered a standout performance that included a new career high in receiving yards. Nacua got there with three catches of 40-plus yards, including a 41-yard touchdown reception in overtime that momentarily snapped a 30-30 tie. The BYU product also kickstarted the Rams' third drive of the game with a 54-yard grab, and Thursday marked his fifth double-digit reception tally of the season. Adams should have a chance to return for a Week 17 Monday night matchup against the Falcons on Monday, Dec. 29, but Nacua naturally will remain an elite fantasy playoffs option in all formats irrespective of his teammate's availability. </div> <h3 id="-tank-bigsby-rb">🟢 Tank Bigsby (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> As usual, Saquon Barkley was a workhorse for the Eagles, posting a 21-132-1 line as a rusher. That left just eight offensive snaps for Bigsby, but he made the most of those opportunities, especially when he ripped off a 22-yard touchdown run late in the fourth quarter to effectively seal the win for Philadelphia. The touchdown was the first of the campaign for Bigsby, who has averaged a robust 6.6 yards on 40 carries this season but isn't likely to be a viable fantasy play as long as Barkley as healthy. </div> <h3 id="-cade-otton-te">🟢 Cade Otton (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> With the Tampa Bay pass-catching corps recently getting healthier with the returns of Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan from injured reserve, Otton appears set to occupy a more muted role in the aerial attack moving forward. Otton has drawn four targets or fewer in each of the Buccaneers' last three games, producing seven catches for 43 yards during that stretch. The lack of reliable target volume makes Otton tough to rely upon in fantasy lineups heading into Tampa Bay's Week 17 matchup with the Dolphins. </div> <h3 id="-emeka-egbuka-wr">🟢 Emeka Egbuka (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Egbuka needed just his one catch to secure the team lead in receiving yards on a day when Baker Mayfield was under the 200-yard mark for the third time in four games. Despite the splash play, fantasy managers have to be disappointed with Egbuka's stretch-run swoon, considering he's been at 42 receiving yards or fewer in five of the last six contests. Egbuka will be a relatively risky option on championship week for many fantasy leagues despite his favorable matchup against the Dolphins on the road next Sunday. </div> <h3 id="-deebo-samuel-wr">🟢 Deebo Samuel (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br> <strong>Details:</strong> It was difficult to judge the Commanders' passing game due to Marcus Mariota's (hand) exit early in the third quarter, though Samuel wasn't particularly impactful at any point in the contest. He did manage a 20-yard gain on a tough catch-and-run over the middle of the field late in the third quarter, accounting for his longest reception of the contest while also marking his eighth catch of at least 20 yards this season. However, Samuel has now been held to 35 yards or fewer in four of his last eight games while topping 50 yards only twice in that span. </div> <hr> <h2 id="-lineup-analysis">📝 Lineup Analysis</h2> <h3
