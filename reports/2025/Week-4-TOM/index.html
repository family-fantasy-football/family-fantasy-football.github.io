</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="marvin-harrison-jr-wr">Marvin Harrison Jr. (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Harrison finished with a team-high yardage total while checking in second in receptions and targets to Trey McBride. The talented wideout also recorded his first touchdown grab since Week 1 on an impressive 16-yard catch in the left corner of the end zone against Devon Witherspoon with 5:50 remaining in the fourth quarter to narrow what had been a 20-6 deficit. Harrison’s catch tally was also a season high, affording the 2024 first-round pick some momentum heading into a favorable Week 5 home matchup against the Titans on Sunday, Oct. 5.</p> <h4 id="james-cook-rb">James Cook (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> The Bills arguably underperformed most of the afternoon given their status as significant home favorites, but Cook’s play didn’t disappoint. The speedy back was over the 100-yard mark on the ground for the third straight game, and he extended his season-opening streak of rushing touchdowns to four games with a one-yard scoring run late in the first quarter. Cook is averaging 5.4 yards per carry overall, even when factoring in an average of 3.4 yards per tote Week 1 against the Ravens. The versatile fourth-year pro also has multiple catches in three of the first four games heading into a Week 5 AFC East home showdown against the Patriots next Sunday night.</p> <h4 id="joe-burrow-qb">Joe Burrow (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Injured Reserve <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR <br> <strong>Details:</strong> While coach Zac Taylor declined to provide a timeline for Burrow’s recovery, a previous report by Ben Baby of ESPN aligns with Rapoport’s estimate that the QB will miss a minimum of three months. With that timetable in mind, Burrow could potentially return later this season, but in the meantime Jake Browning will serve as the Bengals’ No. 1 signal-caller.</p> <h4 id="jk-dobbins-rb">J.K. Dobbins (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Dobbins made Swiss cheese of the Bengals defense Monday, averaging 6.3 yards per carry while helping his team dominate the time of possession battle (+15:56). The bruising back also ended a drought dating back to the 2022 season of Denver failing to produce a 100-yard rusher. The only blemish on the 26-year-old’s night was the lack of a touchdown, ending the scoring streak he started the season with at three games. Dobbins will face a stiffer test Week 5 when the Broncos visit the Eagles on Sunday, but fantasy managers should start their hot asset regardless.</p> <h4 id="jared-goff-qb">Jared Goff (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Goff served primarily as a game manager with his team cruising to a win, as he took to the air fewer than 30 times for the third consecutive game in Detroit’s ground-focused offense. In contrast to those prior games, he lacked efficiency in a tough matchup against the Browns, averaging only 6.2 yards per attempt. Goff still tossed a pair of touchdowns that came from two and eight yards away while also completing three passes of at least 20 yards.</p> <h4 id="matthew-golden-wr">Matthew Golden (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Golden took on a bigger role with Jayden Reed (collarbone) on IR, as the rookie logged his highest target, reception and yardage totals of his career. Most of his production came on the team’s opening possession, as he got behind the Cowboys’ secondary for a 46-yard catch – the longest of his career. Golden appears to be on the verge of truly breaking out as his role continues to expand, but he’ll continue to face plenty of target competition from the likes of tight end Tucker Kraft and fellow wideouts Romeo Doubs and Dontayvion Wicks.</p> <h4 id="romeo-doubs-wr">Romeo Doubs (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Doubs led the Packers in targets in the absence of Jayden Reed (collarbone) and was a key to the team’s offensive explosion with touchdown catches of one, two and 15 yards. Doubs was targeted primarily in the short areas of the field and his longest reception went for only 18 yards. He still managed to top 50 receiving yards for the second time this season, but even with Reed and Christian Watson (knee) on the shelf, target competition remains fierce in Green Bay and coach Matt LaFleur’s offensive scheme won’t move away from Josh Jacobs and the ground game.</p> <h4 id="tyler-warren-te">Tyler Warren (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Warren had an impressive all-around performance, as he earned targets both in the short and deep areas of the field. He accounted for three of the Colts’ four longest plays from scrimmage with receptions of 24, 23 and 17 yards, reaching at least 70 receiving yards for the third time in four games. Warren was also used on the ground on consecutive plays at the goal line early in the second quarter, as he took two direct snaps and scored on the second for his first touchdown in the NFL.</p> <h4 id="travis-hunter-wr">Travis Hunter (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Hunter was involved more on offense (38 snaps) than defense (nine snaps) Sunday, resulting in his highest yardage total through four pro appearances. The two-way star finished third for Jacksonville in both targets and receiving production. The Jaguars will continue searching for that sweet spot in terms of Hunter’s usage on both sides of the ball when the team visits Kansas City next Monday.</p> <h4 id="ashton-jeanty-rb">Ashton Jeanty (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Jeanty’s early fumble fortunately did not earn him a benching – which coaching staffs have been known to do when young players display ball-security issues – as he went on to produce his best game so far in the NFL. It was a welcome sight from the sixth overall pick in this year’s draft, who failed to average over 4.0 yards per carry in any of his first three outings. With a signature performance under his belt, Jeanty’s fantasy managers can start him with confidence heading into next Sunday’s tilt against Indianapolis.</p> <h4 id="omarion-hampton-rb">Omarion Hampton (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> The rookie running back capped his huge performance with a 54-yard touchdown run late in the fourth quarter as the Chargers tried to mount a comeback. Hampton has erupted for 294 yards from scrimmage and two TDs over the last two games as he takes over as the Chargers’ unquestioned lead back in the absence of Najee Harris (Achilles), and he could be poised for big numbers once again Week 5 against a Commanders defense that just got steamrolled for 181 combined yards and a score by the Falcons’ Bijan Robinson.</p> <h4 id="ollie-gordon-ii-rb">Ollie Gordon II (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Gordon found much less running room than backfield mate De’Von Achane, who picked up 99 yards and scored a touchdown on his 20 totes. Gordon now has single-digit rushing yardage totals in three of his first four games, and although he’s earned some short-yardage and red-zone work, he saw Achane cash in on an opportunity in the latter capacity with a nine-yard touchdown run in the third quarter. The rookie sixth-round pick’s fantasy prospects remain modest heading into a Week 5 road matchup against the Panthers that is favorable for ground attacks.</p> <h4 id="jaxson-dart-qb">Jaxson Dart (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Daboll said Dart is “doing good” after having picked up a hamstring injury during Sunday’s 21-18 upset win over the Chargers, per Ralph Vacchiano of Fox Sports. The rookie first-round pick managed to play through the issue Sunday and lead New York to their first win of the 2025 campaign, while completing 13 of 20 passes for 111 yards and a touchdown and rushing 10 times for 54 yards and another score. While it’s encouraging that Dart appears to have avoided a severe injury in his first NFL start, top wideout Malik Nabers (ACL) sustained a season-ending injury Week 4, leaving Wan’Dale Robinson, Darius Slayton, Jalin Hyatt and tight end Theo Johnson positioned as the Giants’ top pass catchers moving forward. As such, Dart will figure to pilot a run-heavy offense Week 5 on the road against New Orleans on Sunday, Oct. 5.</p> <h4 id="jonnu-smith-te">Jonnu Smith (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Smith was unable to practice fully ahead of Pittsburgh’s Week 4 matchup due to a hip injury, but he played through the issue in Dublin. The 2017 third-rounder was held to single-digit yards for the first time this season while playing just 25 percent of the team’s offensive snaps, which was his lowest mark of the season by a considerable margin. It seems possible that Smith’s role was limited by his injury, but he’ll be able to recover during the Steelers’ Week 5 bye.</p> <h4 id="chig-okonkwo-te">Chig Okonkwo (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Cam Ward’s struggles continued, as he completed only 38.5 percent of his passes while passing for 108 yards. No skill-position player on Tennessee’s roster was able to excel as a result, and Okonkwo was no exception. The tight end leads the team in catches with 13 and is third in targets with 19, but that volume has resulted in only 124 receiving yards and zero TDs through four games.</p> <h4 id="elic-ayomanor-wr">Elic Ayomanor (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Ayomanor had been the lone source of optimism for the Titans’ passing offense, showing some rapport with Cam Ward through the first three weeks of the season. That continued to some degree in Week 4, as Ayomanor easily paced the team in targets and yards, though he also had a target glance off his hands for an interception to end one of the team’s best chances to score points. Ayomanor is likely to be a key contributor if Tennessee can turn things around, but the rookie isn’t yet a trustworthy fantasy option.</p> <h4 id="marcus-mariota-qb">Marcus Mariota (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Making his second straight start in place of Jayden Daniels (knee), Mariota and the Commanders’ offense started slowly but eventually caught fire, only for the team’s defense to be unable to come up with a stop when it needed one. Mariota tossed a five-yard TD to Luke McCaffrey late in the second quarter and a 24-yard score to Deebo Samuel in the fourth, while also leading three drives that ended in field goals in the second half. Daniels appears to be on track to return in Week 5, but if Mariota needs to take the reins again, he’ll get a tough road matchup against the Chargers.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_4_2025_TOM_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br><br></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_4_2025_TOM_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> </div> </article> <br> <hr> <br> <ul class="list-disc pl-8"></ul> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-6_links/">Week 6 Links</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-7_preview/">Week 7 Matchups Preview</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-6_Recap/">Week 6 League Recap</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-6-BTE/">Big Titi Energy Week 6 Report</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-6-TIB/">To Infinity and Bijan!
