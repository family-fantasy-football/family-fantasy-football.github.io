</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="michael-penix-jr-qb">Michael Penix Jr. (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Penix opened his first full season as a starter in fine fashion, looking poised and in command against a veteran, aggressive Buccaneers defense for most of the afternoon. The southpaw signal-caller leveraged Bijan Robinson’s elite yards-after-catch skills on the opening drive, hitting his star running back for a 50-yard catch-and-run touchdown. Penix would go on to cap off an 18-play, 91-yard marathon drive in the fourth quarter with a four-yard touchdown run, and he then drove the Falcons a total of 60 yards in eight plays to put them in position for a would-be game-tying field goal that Younghoe Koo couldn’t convert. Penix also lost Drake London to a shoulder injury for that final drive, and it remains to be seen if he’ll have his top target available for a Week 2 road showdown with the Vikings next Sunday night.</p> <h4 id="rome-odunze-wr">Rome Odunze (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Odunze kept hope alive for the Bears with a one-yard touchdown catch just before the two-minute warning in the fourth quarter. His nine targets paced the team, though DJ Moore (68) and Olamide Zaccheaus (42) both had more receiving yards Monday. Odunze, a 2024 first-round pick, is set up for a more consistent role in his second NFL season after he had three-plus catches in only nine of 17 games as a rookie. Up next for the Bears is a Week 2 trip to Detroit.</p> <h4 id="dandre-swift-rb">D’Andre Swift (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Swift finished five yards shy of Caleb Williams’ team-high rushing total and was the only Bears running back to record a carry, though rookie Kyle Monangai had one catch out of the backfield. While Swift seems locked into a high touch floor again due to a lack of competition, efficiency remains a concern, as he averaged a career-low 3.8 yards per carry last season and dipped to just 3.1 in Monday’s small sample. Finding running room won’t be easy Week 2 against the Lions, who held Swift to 59 yards on 20 carries (3.0 YPC) in two 2024 meetings.</p> <h4 id="caleb-williams-qb">Caleb Williams (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Williams got the Ben Johnson era off to an efficient start, hitting his first 10 throws under Chicago’s new head coach and play caller. That strong stretch also included a nine-yard Williams rushing touchdown to cap the opening drive. His first miss was a costly one, though, as it came on fourth down well into Vikings territory. Chicago took a 17-6 lead into the fourth quarter, but the Vikings responded with 21 unanswered points before Williams finally stemmed the bleeding with a one-yard touchdown pass to Rome Odunze with 2:02 remaining. The Bears got the ball back in the final seconds but couldn’t muster a final push. Williams’ rushing production was encouraging, but he struggled with accuracy after his hot start through the air. He’ll try to put together a more complete performance against the Lions in Week 2.</p> <h4 id="jayden-reed-wr">Jayden Reed (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Reed likely will be operating under a maintenance program for as long as the Jones fracture in his left foot is bothering him, but he was able to suit up for Sunday’s win against the Lions, logging 18 of 48 offensive snaps (38 percent) in the process. He was effective with his limited workload, hauling in three of five targets for 45 yards and one touchdown and taking two punt returns for 21 yards. Reed will have two more chances to be deemed a practice participant this week ahead of Thursday’s matchup with the Commanders.</p> <h4 id="travis-kelce-te">Travis Kelce (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> It was shaping up as an utterly forgettable night for Kelce until his early fourth-quarter 37-yard touchdown grab, as he had just one catch for 10 yards until that point and had collided with teammate Xavier Worthy on the third play from scrimmage, causing a shoulder injury that forced the latter’s exit from the game. Kelce’s score therefore served as the only highlight of his night, and with Worthy out, both Hollywood Brown and JuJu Smith-Schuster outpaced the talented tight end in targets. Kelce could well see an increase in opportunity during a Week 2 home Super Bowl LIX rematch against the Eagles on Sunday, Sept. 14, especially if Worthy remains sidelined for that marquee contest.</p> <h4 id="hunter-henry-te">Hunter Henry (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Henry – whose eight targets tied for the team lead – was on the field for 66 of a possible 71 snaps on offense in the contest, per Mike Reiss of ESPN.com, while fellow tight end Austin Hooper logged 23 snaps and one catch for 10 yards. In the weeks ahead, Henry should continue to maintain enough of a workload and target volume to merit fantasy lineup consideration. Next up for the Patriots is a road game against a Miami team that lost to Indianapolis in Week 1 by a score of 33-8.</p> <h4 id="chris-olave-wr">Chris Olave (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> The oft-injured wideout went to the sideline early in the game with what was reported to be a chest injury, but Olave quickly returned and wound up leading the Saints in targets. Meanwhile, tight end Juwan Johnson surpassed him in catches and yards. New Orleans’ passing game under new coach Kellen Moore could be a boon to all the team’s top pass catchers, as Spencer Rattler attempted a career-high 46 passes despite the fact that the score remained fairly close the whole way. Olave will look to stay on the field and continue building chemistry with Rattler in a Week 2 home clash against the 49ers.</p> <h4 id="devonta-smith-wr">DeVonta Smith (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br> <strong>Details:</strong> As Smith’s line corroborates, it was a quiet night for the speedster to open the 2025 campaign. Smith finished behind both Saquon Barkley and Dallas Goedert in receptions on the night, while No. 3 receiver Jahan Dotson outgained him by 43 yards on the same number of catches. Nevertheless, there’s no question more productive days are ahead for Smith, and a Week 2 road rematch with a Chiefs team he recorded 69 yards and a touchdown against in Super Bowl LIX in February may provide just the platform for Smith’s first noteworthy performance of the new season.</p> <h4 id="kaleb-johnson-rb">Kaleb Johnson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Johnson clearly served as Pittsburgh’s third running back, with his only rushing attempt coming late in the third quarter. His primary contribution came as a kick returner, though he narrowly escaped disaster when a teammate recovered his fumble on a return late in the first quarter. Johnson had an uneven training camp due to his work as a pass blocker and receiver, so he’ll likely continue to be brought along slowly behind Jaylen Warren and Kenneth Gainwell.</p> <h4 id="dk-metcalf-wr">DK Metcalf (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Metcalf led the Steelers in targets and yards in his debut with the team, with the majority of his production coming after the catch. He logged long gains of 31 and 23 yards on quick screens in the first quarter before working over the middle for an 18-yard gain late in the third quarter. Jonnu Smith and Calvin Austin were also heavily targeted in the offense, so Metcalf may have inconsistent results. However, he had a strong Week 1 performance with his new team.</p> <h4 id="christian-mccaffrey-rb">Christian McCaffrey (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> McCaffrey shook off any concerns from popping up on the injury report late in the practice week by handling 31 combined touches in a tight victory over a division foe to kick off the regular season. Newly-acquired backup Brian Robinson (9-33-0) was the only other back to receive a carry outside of McCaffrey. The 49ers didn’t have the luxury of taking a cautious approach with its star running back after TE George Kittle (hamstring) and WR Jauan Jennings (shoulder) both left Sunday’s contest due to injury. McCaffrey could continue to see extra work as a receiver if either of his banged-up teammates are forced to miss next Sunday’s road matchup against the Saints.</p> <h4 id="rachaad-white-rb">Rachaad White (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> White unsurprisingly played a clear second fiddle to Bucky Irving, logging 12 fewer carries than his teammate. White also was three targets behind Irving and trailed the latter in snaps by a 44-14 margin. While the division of labor between the two wasn’t typically as unbalanced down the stretch last season during Irving’s ascension within the offense, White’s fantasy outlook is bleak for the time being heading into a tough Week 2 road matchup against the Texans next Monday night.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_1_2025_JST_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br><br></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_1_2025_JST_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> </div> </article> <br> <hr> <br> <ul class="list-disc pl-8"></ul> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-10_links/">Week 10 Links</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-11_preview/">Week 11 Matchups Preview</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-10_Recap/">Week 10 League Recap</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-10-EET/">Emma's Excellent Team Week 10 Report</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-10-TIB/">To Infinity and Bijan!
