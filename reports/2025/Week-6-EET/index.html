The 23-year-old London didn't cool off over his team's Week 5 bye, bookending the break with a pair of 100-plus yard games with a touchdown scored in each. He actually finished the contest as the only wide receiver to record a catch for Atlanta, highlighting his status as QB Michael Penix's unquestioned No. 1 target. A red-hot London will set his sights on a battered 49ers defense Week 7. </div> <h3 id="-justice-hill-rb">🟢 Justice Hill (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> The Ravens ran a run-heavy offense as long as possible, giving Hill a chance to mix in on possessions to relieve Derrick Henry. Hill saw a season-high six carries as a result, but he made a more significant impact as a pass catcher. His usage could change with the anticipated return of Lamar Jackson (hamstring) after the team's bye, but Hill has at least three catches in four of six games on the campaign. </div> <h3 id="-joshua-palmer-wr">🟡 Joshua Palmer (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Palmer was forced out of the first half of Monday's 24-14 loss to the Falcons with an ankle injury, finishing the night with two receptions for 60 yards. Though Palmer may have been hard-pressed to make it back to the field if the Bills played on Sunday this week, he'll benefit from Buffalo being on bye for Week 7. The wideout will still need to resume practicing in some fashion during Week 8 to have a chance at playing in the Bills' next game Oct. 26 versus the Panthers. </div> <h3 id="-courtland-sutton-wr">🟢 Courtland Sutton (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Sutton traveled overseas to London for Sunday's international tilt, only to be greeted impolitely by Jets' CB Sauce Gardner once the game kicked off. The shutdown corner won his individual matchup against Sutton, holding Denver's No. 1 wideout to just one reception in the narrow victory. This was Sutton's second one-catch performance through six starts this season, which would be concerning if he hadn't posted WR1 numbers in his four other appearances. Sunday's dud can be written off as a bad matchup coupled with an unfavorable game script. Look for Sutton to get back to his productive ways against the Giants next Sunday. </div> <h3 id="-trevor-lawrence-qb">🟢 Trevor Lawrence (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Lawrence's final passing line with more than adequate, but he also took seven sacks and finished with an ugly 46.6 QBR for the afternoon. The 2021 first overall pick did continue to cultivate his connection with No. 1 receiver Brian Thomas, who he hit on eight occasions for 90 yards, including a 21-yard touchdown late in the first quarter. Lawrence hit Tim Patrick from 26 yards out early in the fourth quarter for his other TD toss, the quarterback's first multi-touchdown-pass tally since Week 2. Despite the solid numbers, the modest point total did Jacksonville in Sunday, a matter he'll look to rectify in a London matchup against the high-powered Rams in Week 7. </div> <h3 id="-hollywood-brown-wr">🟢 Hollywood Brown (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Brown delivered a standout performance under the bright lights of Sunday Night Football when he lifted his team with two trips to the end zone in the second half. The 28-year-old has done an admirable job starting for a thin Chiefs' receiving corps, producing a 30-302-3 line through six weeks of action. The impending doom Brown's managers are currently feeling is the looming return of Kansas City's top WR Rashee Rice. The suspended wideout will return for next Sunday's tilt against the Raiders, potentially eating into his replacement's production in the process. Brown should remain rostered until the dust settles from Rice's return, but expectations should be kept in check for Week 7. </div> <h3 id="-jakobi-meyers-wr">🟡 Jakobi Meyers (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Meyers, who logged 90 percent snap share in a Week 6 win over the Titans, didn't practice Wednesday, but his anticipated presence a day later bodes well for his chances of being available Sunday against the Chiefs. The Raiders' upcoming injury report will clarify the wideout's official participation level Thursday. </div> <h3 id="-rashid-shaheed-wr">🟢 Rashid Shaheed (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> The speedy wideout has caught exactly four passes in five straight games, but Sunday's yardage total was his lowest of the season. Shaheed remains dependent on deep throws for significant fantasy value, but with Spencer Rattler getting more confident and comfortable in coach Kellen Moore's offense, connections like last week's 87-yard TD could become more frequent. Shaheed may have a better chance of making an impact in Week 7 against the Bears. </div> <h3 id="-saquon-barkley-rb">🟢 Saquon Barkley (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Barkley was set up well on paper for a matchup against the Giants' porous run defense, but game script would eventually cap his opportunities and lead to his second-lowest carry total of the campaign. He was efficient with his opportunities, averaging an encouraging 4.8 yards per carry after posting 5.0 yards per tote in the Week 5 loss to the Broncos. Barkley has still to crack the 90-yard mark on the ground through six games, however, and he's still averaging just 3.4 yards per carry on the season thanks to a slow start to the season. Barkley will have a tough Week 7 challenge on his hands as well, considering the talented Vikings defense awaits in a Week 7 road matchup on Sunday, Oct. 19. </div> <h3 id="-george-kittle-te">🟢 George Kittle (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Injured Reserve<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Last Wednesday, Shanahan told David Lombardi of SFStandard.com that Kittle as a chance to suit up Week 7, and the tight end's return to practice this Wednesday is the first step in making that a reality. Kittle has been sidelined since the season opener, when he injured his hamstring in the first half of an eventual 49ers win at Seattle. Ultimately, Friday's practice report will reveal his odds to play Sunday versus the Falcons. </div> <h3 id="-brock-purdy-qb">🟡 Brock Purdy (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Purdy has been battling a turf toe injury for most of the season, sitting out Weeks 2 and 3 and 5 and 6 as a result. He was able to log conditioning work on the side last Thursday, and Shanahan told Nick Wagoner of ESPN.com on Monday that Purdy would be evaluated Wednesday to see if taking part in practice was possible. Now that Purdy has resumed on-field work, Shanahan said Purdy is more limited than backup quarterback Mac Jones (knee/oblique), per Matt Barrows of The Athletic. It's unclear if that means Jones is a better bet than Purdy to start Sunday's game against the Falcons, but the latter at least is putting himself in a position to return to action. </div> <h3 id="-tony-pollard-rb">🟢 Tony Pollard (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Pollard finished with his worst fantasy score of the season in a seemingly promising matchup against the Raiders defense. The veteran starter still led Tennessee's backfield with 10 carries, finishing five ahead of backup Tyjae Spears. Pollard's reduced touches were rather the result of a poor game script as opposed to a changing of the guard in Tennessee's backfield. Fantasy managers should continue treating Pollard as a potential flex option against the Patriots next Sunday. </div> <h3 id="-zach-ertz-te">🟢 Zach Ertz (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Following a Week 5 blanking at the hands of the Chargers, Ertz enjoyed a noteworthy resurgence in Monday's narrow loss. The veteran tight end led the Commanders in receptions and targets while checking in behind only Chris Moore in receiving yards. Ertz also posted his first touchdown since Week 2 on a six-yard scoring grab early in the fourth quarter, rounding out an encouraging night that also saw him tie a season high in receptions. He should have a good chance at carrying over his momentum into Week 7, as he'll face the Cowboys' vulnerable defense on the road. </div> <hr> <h2 id="-lineup-analysis">📝 Lineup Analysis</h2> <h3
