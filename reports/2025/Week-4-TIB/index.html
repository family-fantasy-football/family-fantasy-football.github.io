</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="kyler-murray-qb">Kyler Murray (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Murray endured a difficult night despite completing a respectable 65.9 percent of his passes and throwing multiple touchdowns for the second time in four contests. The 2019 first overall pick took six sacks, and his second-quarter interception came at the Seahawks’ 22-yard line to snuff out what would have been a high probability of at least three points in a game ultimately decided by a field goal. Murray did lead the Cardinals on a clutch 12-play, 57-yard march late in the fourth quarter that culminated in a seven-yard touchdown pass to Emari Demercado, but Sam Darnold and the Seahawks had just enough time to squeak out the victory. Murray takes a 6:3 TD:INT and impressive 25-148-0 rushing line over four games into a favorable Week 5 home matchup against the Titans on Sunday, Oct. 5.</p> <h4 id="darnell-mooney-wr">Darnell Mooney (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Mooney was forced out of Sunday’s 34-27 win over the Commanders early in the third quarter due to a hamstring injury, but he’s not expected to miss any further time. He secured his only target for 16 yards before exiting Sunday’s contest. Mooney also missed Week 1 due to a shoulder injury, and across his three appearances this season he’s tallied just seven catches for 79 yards on 16 targets.</p> <h4 id="kyle-pitts-sr-te">Kyle Pitts Sr. (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> The tight end put together his best game of the season as QB Michael Penix posted career-best passing numbers, with Pitts hauling in his first TD of the year on a seven-yard toss in the third quarter. Pitts has seen at least five targets in every game so far and delivered a 20-205-1 line on 24 targets heading into Atlanta’s Week 5 bye, putting him on pace for his best campaign since his stunning NFL debut in 2021.</p> <h4 id="mark-andrews-te">Mark Andrews (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Andrews maintained increased involvement in Baltimore’s offense, and he has 13 catches on 14 targets across the last two weeks. However, his production Sunday wasn’t particularly strong, as his longest reception went for only seven yards. Andrews’ ability to command targets – particularly with Isaiah Likely back in the mix – is a positive, but his ability to consistently make explosive plays appears to be behind him, and the upside of the entire Ravens passing game could take a hit if Lamar Jackson (hamstring) misses time.</p> <h4 id="keon-coleman-wr">Keon Coleman (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Coleman finished tied for second in receptions and targets while also serving as the runner-up in receiving yards for the Bills during a relatively low-volume day for the passing attack. The Saints did give Buffalo a more competitive game than expected, and Coleman recorded his third catch of 20-plus yards this season on his way to his best yardage tally since Week 1. The second-year wideout will take a 17-203-1 line on 22 targets into a Week 5 home matchup against the Patriots next Sunday night.</p> <h4 id="tetairoa-mcmillan-wr">Tetairoa McMillan (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> McMillan had been listed as questionable coming into the afternoon due to a calf issue, but the rookie first-round pick kept up his strong play while recording a team-high receiving yardage total. He also tied with Tommy Tremble for the team lead in targets, and given the disastrous team outcome for Carolina, the talented wideout’s numbers were respectable. The Arizona product has risen above the Panthers’ offensive struggles overall to eclipse the 60-yard mark in three of his first four NFL games, and he’ll look to capitalize on a favorable matchup against the shaky Dolphins defense in a Week 5 home matchup next Sunday afternoon.</p> <h4 id="luther-burden-iii-wr">Luther Burden III (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Aside from Burden’s 101-yard effort in Week 3 against the woeful Dallas defense, he has a total of minus-three yards in his other three games. Until his role in the offense grows, Burden’s floor makes him difficult to place in fantasy lineups.</p> <h4 id="javonte-williams-rb">Javonte Williams (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Williams managed to reach the century mark in total yards while punching in his fourth touchdown in as many starts this season. The 25-year-old is finally delivering on the potential he flashed as a rookie in Denver back in 2021, prior to a serious knee injury in 2022. Williams has a stranglehold on the Cowboys’ starting job with 19.8 touches per game, making him a plus fantasy option heading into next Sunday’s tilt against the Jets.</p> <h4 id="josh-jacobs-rb">Josh Jacobs (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Jacobs had only 48 yards at halftime, but he found more room to work as both a runner and receiver in the second half. The highlight of his performance was an 18-yard touchdown early in the fourth quarter, which was one of his three ground gains of 10-plus yards. Jacobs also made an impact as a pass catcher, surpassing 70 receiving yards for the fourth time in his career and second time as a Packer. Sunday night’s performance was also the first time he surpassed 100 total yards in a game this season, though he has found the end zone in three of four contests.</p> <h4 id="nick-chubb-rb">Nick Chubb (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Chubb was the first running back to get a touch for Houston, but he alternated drives with Woody Marks in the first half before the duo shared drives and split work evenly in the final two quarters. Chubb was effective for long stretches of the game, tallying six carries or receptions of at least six yards. However, he was out-touched by Marks for the first time this season and could continue to cede work as the season progresses, although the blowout nature of Sunday’s contest may have contributed to the rookie seeing more volume.</p> <h4 id="quentin-johnston-wr">Quentin Johnston (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> The 2023 first-round pick appears to be coming into his own. Johnston hauled in his fourth TD in four games with a 36-yard strike from Justin Herbert in the second quarter, and he led the Chargers in receptions, receiving yards and targets on the afternoon while setting personal bests for the season in all three categories. Johnston’s 2025 rise has coincided with a decline in fortunes for Ladd McConkey, and at some point Herbert may make an effort to get the latter going, but Johnston will be the one taking an impressive 22-337-4 line on 36 targets into a Week 5 meeting with the Commanders.</p> <h4 id="justin-jefferson-wr">Justin Jefferson (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br> <strong>Details:</strong> The superstar wideout saw double-digit targets for the first time this season and topped 100 yards for the first time as well, as the Vikings struggled to get their rushing attack going. Jefferson may have also had a little more room to operate with Jordan Addison (4-114-0 on eight targets) back from his suspension and providing another downfield threat for secondaries to worry about. Jefferson will take a 22-326-1 line on 31 targets into a Week 5 clash against the Browns in London, another defense that has been far more vulnerable through the air than on the ground to begin the season.</p> <h4 id="carson-wentz-qb">Carson Wentz (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> The Vikings lost right tackle Brian O’Neill to a knee injury and center Ryan Kelly to a concussion in the first half, and Wentz was under constant pressure as a result, getting sacked six times in total. Minnesota headed into the fourth quarter staring at a 21-6 deficit, but Wentz was able to lead a comeback that fell just short, hitting Zavier Scott for a 16-yard TD and Nailor for a two-yard score inside the final four minutes. On the other hand, the veteran QB almost threw a third INT in crunch time, only to have it overturned upon review. With J.J. McCarthy (ankle) not quite 100 percent yet, Wentz is expected to get another start in London for a Week 5 clash with the Browns, but he’ll need to take better care of the ball to have a shot at retaining the job when the Vikings return from Europe.</p> <h4 id="treveyon-henderson-rb">TreVeyon Henderson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> The rookie second-round pick saw two fewer carries than Rhamondre Stevenson despite the latter’s Week 3 fumbling issues, but Henderson still turned in a serviceable fantasy performance thanks to his first NFL touchdown. Henderson got into the end zone from five yards out with just under six minutes left in the second quarter, and his rushing yardage tally represented a new career high. He’s hauled in multiple receptions in each of his first four games, but he appears stuck in a three-way backfield committee with Stevenson and Antonio Gibson heading into a Week 5 road matchup against the Bills next Sunday night.</p> <h4 id="malik-nabers-wr">Malik Nabers (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Injured Reserve <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Salomone also relayed earlier Monday that coach Brian Daboll confirmed Nabers will miss the rest of the season with a torn ACL. With Nabers officially on IR, Wan’Dale Robinson, Darius Slayton and Jalin Hyatt are poised to lead the teams’ WR corps going forward, with Beaux Collins and Gunner Olszewski also available to mix in. In any case, losing the talented 2024 first-rounder for the rest of the campaign is a huge loss for a New York offense now helmed by rookie QB Jaxson Dart. Given the timing of his injury, Nabers – who is expected to undergo surgery in the coming weeks, per Jordan Raanan of ESPN.com – has a chance to be ready for the start of the 2026 regular season, though the Giants have yet to outline a estimated timetable for his recovery.</p> <h4 id="justin-fields-qb">Justin Fields (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Fields made a successful return from a one-game absence after suffering a concussion in a Week 2 loss to the Bills. The dual-threat quarterback was decisive in the pocket, getting the ball to his top play makers and taking off for big gains against good coverage. Fields’ highlight-reel play came on a broken fourth-and-1 attempt that he was forced to reverse field on and outrun the entire defense for a 43-yard touchdown. While the Jets still can’t buy a win, the team’s signal-caller has looked like an elite fantasy asset in the two starts he has completed this season. Fields has a great opportunity to keep this momentum rolling in a plus matchup against Dallas in Week 5.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_4_2025_TIB_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br><br></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_4_2025_TIB_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> </div> </article> <br> <hr> <br> <ul class="list-disc pl-8"></ul> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-5_preview/">Week 5 Matchups Preview</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-4_Recap/">Week 4 League Recap</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-4-TTC/">Third Time's the Charm?
