The 24-year-old was held out of the end zone for the ninth straight game since a standout performance back in Week 1 (7-143-1). The good news for the wideout's managers is that he has maintained a high fantasy floor with averages of 5.3 receptions and 62.2 receiving yards over those nine scoreless outings. Flowers should continue providing numbers worthy of starting -- especially in PPR formats -- against the Jets next Sunday. </div> <h3 id="-derrick-henry-rb">🟢 Derrick Henry (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Henry put it all together Sunday with his first game going over 100 rushing yards while also scoring a touchdown since his monster Week 1 performance. The 31-year-old is averaging 20.4 carries over Baltimore's last five contests after seeing only 12.8 totes per game over the team's 1-4 start to the campaign. The surging Ravens figure to continue leaning on King Henry in hopes of a fifth straight win next Sunday against the Jets. </div> <h3 id="-samaje-perine-rb">🟡 Samaje Perine (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable </div> <h3 id="-amon-ra-st-brown-wr">🟢 Amon-Ra St. Brown (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Jared Goff completed a career-worst 37.8 percent of his pass attempts Sunday, and he uncharacteristically struggled to get the ball to St. Brown. Despite easily leading the team in targets, St. Brown logged his lowest catch and yardage totals of the campaign. While it was a disappointing showing, St. Brown's role in the Detroit offense is unquestioned, and he should bounce back in Week 12 against the Giants. </div> <h3 id="-sam-laporta-te">🔴 Sam LaPorta (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Injured Reserve<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br> <strong>Details:</strong> LaPorta thus will miss at least the next four games due to the back injury that didn't allow him to practice this week before Detroit ruled him out for Week 11 action Friday. His next chance to play will be Sunday, Dec. 14 at the Rams. In the meantime, Brock Wright (ankle) and Ross Dwelley will handle TE duties for the Lions. </div> <h3 id="-jordan-love-qb">🟢 Jordan Love (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Love was forced from the game at one point due to a shoulder injury, and although Zach Jacobson of 24/7 Sports reports the quarterback's shoulder was in good enough shape for him to reenter the game, it will undergo further evaluation by the team's medical staff in Green Bay. Meanwhile, Love was able to lead the Packers to victory against a feisty Giants team, connecting with Josh Whyle (two yards) and Christian Watson (17 yards) for his pair of scoring tosses. Love added a two-point conversion to Emanuel Wilson after the latter TD, and that sequence provided what proved to be the game-winning points. Love snapped a three-game TD-pass drought with the pair of scoring strikes and will next face a talented Vikings defense in a Week 12 home divisional showdown next Sunday. </div> <h3 id="-alec-pierce-wr">🟢 Alec Pierce (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Pierce finished second in receptions, receiving yards and targets for the Colts behind Tyler Warren while also catching Daniel Jones' one touchdown pass of the day from 37 yards out in the first quarter. It was the fourth-year pro's first score of the season, and Pierce now has at least 69 receiving yards in four consecutive contests. The 2022 second-round pick is enjoying his most consistent season yet, as he heads into the Week 11 bye having already posted a 28-585-1 receiving line through eight games with 10 catches of 20-plus yards. </div> <h3 id="-kareem-hunt-rb">🟢 Kareem Hunt (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> The veteran running back got into the end zone for a third straight game when he punched home a two-yard TD in the third quarter. Hunt's 62 scrimmage yards were also a season high, as he continues to need those touchdowns to keep his fantasy relevance. Through 10 games, he's produced just 419 scrimmage yards but has seven totals TDs -- six on the ground and one through the air. Hunt will look to hit paydirt again in Week 12 against the Colts. </div> <h3 id="-tre-tucker-wr">🟢 Tre Tucker (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Tucker experienced greater success in his second game operating as the Raiders' top wideout after cashing in his team's only touchdown of the evening. It was the 24-year-old's first trip to the end zone since scoring thrice back in Week 3, and the eight targets were also the most he's garnered since that standout performance. Tucker was already providing a solid floor for fantasy managers prior to Las Vegas dealing Jakobi Meyers to Jacksonville at the trade deadline. Even with the Raiders struggling on offense this season, Tucker's increased role should keep him in the mix as a flex option for Week 12 and beyond. </div> <h3 id="-keenan-allen-wr">🟢 Keenan Allen (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Allen paced Los Angeles in targets, catches and receiving yards on a day when Justin Herbert was under constant duress, completing just 10 of 18 passes for 81 scoreless yards and one interception prior to being removed from the game in the fourth quarter of the blowout defeat in favor of Trey Lance. Prior to Sunday, Allen hadn't topped 50 yards receiving in a game since Week 7, and he's gone without a touchdown in four consecutive contests. With the emergence of Oronde Gadsden and Quentin Johnston's return to health, Allen has taken more of a back seat in the passing game of late. The Chargers will now head into their Week 12 bye. </div> <h3 id="-jonnu-smith-te">🟢 Jonnu Smith (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Smith has struggled to carve out much of a role to begin his time with the Steelers, and he's been especially uninvolved in the passing game over the past two weeks, as he's secured just one of four targets for four yards during that time. Pat Freiermuth and Darnell Washington have been slightly more reliable recently, leaving Smith as a shaky fantasy option heading into the final month and a half of the regular season. </div> <h3 id="-kenneth-gainwell-rb">🟢 Kenneth Gainwell (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Gainwell capped the opening drive with an 11-yard receiving touchdown. Jaylen Warren played only one snap after hurting his ankle in the third quarter, opening the door for Gainwell to play a larger role. Gainwell didn't find much running room but continued to make significant contributions as a pass catcher out of the backfield, including by notching a five-yard touchdown catch in the fourth quarter on a pass from Mason Rudolph, who replaced Aaron Rodgers (left wrist) at halftime. If Warren is unavailable or limited in Week 12, Gainwell could take on a hefty workload against the Bears. </div> <h3 id="-cam-ward-qb">🟢 Cam Ward (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Ward was serviceable coming out of his first NFL bye week, and the fact he lost Calvin Ridley to a season-ending fibula injury and Chimere Dike to a chest contusion within Sunday's game certainly didn't help his cause. Additionally, Ward was navigating a talented and aggressive Texans defense that sacked him three times and consistently pressured him. The rookie first overall pick did connect with Van Jefferson for a four-yard game-tying touchdown at the 1:35 mark of the fourth quarter, but that play was preceded by Ward's fumble early in the period that led to a Texans field goal. Ward will head into another unenviable home matchup against the Seahawks in Week 12 working with a short-handed pass-catching corps yet again. </div> <h3 id="-jacory-croskey-merritt-rb">🟢 Jacory Croskey-Merritt (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Chris Rodriguez got the start for the Commanders and wound up seeing 16 touches to Croskey-Merritt's 10 while significantly out-gaining the rookie as well. The coaching staff will get a Week 12 bye to re-evaluate the offense, but Croskey-Merritt's role seems more likely to shrink than grow, as he's gone five straight games without reaching 40 rushing yards. On the season, he's produced 498 rushing yards on 114 totes for 4.4 yards per carry, but that number has plummeted to 2.9 YPC during that five-game swoon. </div> <hr> <h2 id="-lineup-analysis">📝
