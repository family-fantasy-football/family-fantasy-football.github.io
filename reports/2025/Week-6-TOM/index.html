</code></pre> <hr> <h2 id="-player-report">🏥 Player Report</h2> <h3 id="-marvin-harrison-jr-wr">🟡 Marvin Harrison Jr. (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Harrison was diagnosed with a concussion during this past Sunday's loss at Indianapolis, and while Jonathan Gannon told Dani Sureck of the team's official site on Wednesday that the second-year wide receiver remains in the protocol for head injuries, his limited listing indicates he at least has made some progress through it. In order to play Sunday against the Packers, though, Harrison will need to gain clearance from an independent neurologist. Arizona's receiving corps is particularly banged up at the moment, as Michael Wilson (foot, limited) and Zay Jones (knee, DNP) also are tending to injuries. </div> <h3 id="-james-cook-iii-rb">🟢 James Cook III (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Cook enjoyed a solid night on the ground despite game script working against the run as the game unfolded, bouncing back nicely from a 49-yard showing in the Week 5 loss to the Patriots. However, he failed to draw a target for the first time this season after not hauling in the one pass thrown his way Week 5, a relatively rare slump for him as a pass catcher. Cook's fantasy value remains significantly elevated in all formats, however, and he draws a favorable matchup on the road against the Panthers on Sunday, Oct. 26 following Buffalo's Week 7 bye. </div> <h3 id="-jk-dobbins-rb">🟢 J.K. Dobbins (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Denver's entire backfield struggled to find running lanes Sunday, with no tailbacks finishing with a per-carry average higher than 3.0 yards in the win. Dobbins still comfortably led the Broncos with 14 rushing attempts, 12 more than rookie backup RJ Harvey. This was easily Dobbins' worst fantasy score of the season after providing managers with five weeks of consistent RB2 production. The veteran starter has an excellent opportunity to get back on track in Week 7 against the Giants, who currently are surrendering 128.8 rushing yards per game thus far this season. </div> <h3 id="-romeo-doubs-wr">🟢 Romeo Doubs (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Doubs was Jordan Love's top target in Sunday's win, leading the team in targets. He converted that into his third performance of 50 or more receiving yards this season, thanks to long gains of 21 and 15 yards. Doubs isn't likely to turn in huge fantasy performances often thanks to the emergence of Matthew Golden and Tucker Kraft, but it's clear he has rapport and the trust of Love, which should be enough to keep Doubs involved in the offense. </div> <h3 id="-matthew-golden-wr">🟢 Matthew Golden (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Golden continues to get more involved in the Green Bay offense, as he's now earned at least five targets in each of his last three games. He was impressive with the opportunity, ripping off long gains of 35 and 31 yards, the latter of which all but clinched a win for the Packers. Golden topped 100 yards from scrimmage for the first time in his career while showcasing his ability to work deep down the field and also pick up yards after the catch. He appears to be earning trust from coaches and Jordan Love, which should lead to more consistent usage as the season progresses. </div> <h3 id="-tyler-warren-te">🟢 Tyler Warren (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Warren tied Josh Downs for the team lead in receptions and led the way in both receiving yards and targets on an afternoon where he also recorded his second touchdown grab of the season. Warren found the end zone from eight yards out to cap off the opening possession of the game, and he tallied his fifth catch of 20-plus yards this season earlier in the drive with a 23-yard reception. The rookie tight end will continue to serve as a focal point of the offense during a Week 7 marquee road matchup against the Chargers. </div> <h3 id="-travis-hunter-wr">🟢 Travis Hunter (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Hunter had career highs for snap share (79 percent) and route share (88 percent) in Sunday's loss to Seattle, but his seven targets largely came near the line of scrimmage (4.0 aDOT) and led to a meager 4-15-0 receiving line. He's already getting a few schemed touches each week yet has a much lower per-route target rate (19 percent) than teammates Brian Thomas (24 percent), Parker Washington (25 percent), Travis Etienne (23 percent) and Bhayshul Tuten (29 percent). The Jaguars could look to get Hunter more deep/intermediate targets, but that won't necessarily be easy to do against a tough Rams defense this Sunday in London. </div> <h3 id="-ashton-jeanty-rb">🟢 Ashton Jeanty (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Jeanty ground out a solid fantasy day by scoring his third rushing touchdown of the year on a season-high 23 carries. Veteran backup Raheem Mostert (five carries) was the only other rusher to record a touch in the win, highlighting Jeanty's stranglehold on the every-down role out of Las Vegas' backfield. The sixth overall pick from this year's draft has generated 497 combined yards from scrimmage with five total touchdowns through six starts in 2025. Jeanty's offensive involvement has increased with an average of 22.3 touches over the Raiders' last three contests. Fantasy managers can start the Boise State product with confidence for next Sunday's road tilt against the Chiefs. </div> <h3 id="-omarion-hampton-rb">🟢 Omarion Hampton (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Injured Reserve<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Chargers head coach Jim Harbaugh didn't provide many details about the injury Hampton sustained in the Week 5 loss to the Commanders, but the fact that the promising rookie is expected to need more than four weeks to make a full recovery points to him likely nursing a high-ankle sprain. A target date for Hampton's return has yet to be established, but because the Chargers have a bye coming up in Week 12, the team could be motivated to hold him out through that period to give him ample time to heal. Garafolo notes that Hassan Haskins is likely to serve as the Chargers' lead back Sunday in Miami while practice-squad signee Kimani Vidal also sees work, but Los Angeles is also expected to be in the market for a running back ahead of the Nov. 4 trade deadline to compensate for the long-term injuries to Hampton and Najee Harris (Achilles). </div> <h3 id="-ollie-gordon-ii-rb">🟢 Ollie Gordon II (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Gordon once again struggled to display efficiency while operating as the Dolphins' top reserve backfield option, while starter De'Von Achane gashed Los Angeles with 16 carries for 128 rushing yards (8.0 YPC) and two scores, adding four grabs for 22 yards in the receiving game (six targets). At this stage, Gordon retains fantasy value purely as a handcuff in deeper formats, as his availability has rendered Jaylen Wright a healthy scratch. The rookie sixth-round pick faces a rough matchup on the road against Cleveland in Week 7. </div> <h3 id="-kayshon-boutte-wr">🟢 Kayshon Boutte (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br> <strong>Details:</strong> While his target volume was modest, it was Boutte's biggest share since Week 1, and he led the Patriots in receptions and receiving yards Sunday while hauling in scores of 25 and 29 yards from Drake Maye in the first half. Boutte will take an 18-301-3 line on 23 targets this season into a Week 7 clash with the Titans, and with Maye seemingly headed for a breakout campaign, the third-year wideout's fantasy value may be on the upswing. </div> <h3 id="-mac-jones-qb">🟡 Mac Jones (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Jones will be joined on the practice field by No. 1 QB Brock Purdy (toe), though the latter will be more limited than the former, according to what Shanahan told Matt Barrows of The Athletic. It's unknown if that means Jones has better odds than Purdy to continue leading the 49ers offense Week 7, but Purdy at least has put himself in a position to see his first game action since Week 4. In four starts in place of Purdy this season, Jones has completed 113 of 168 passes (67.3 percent) for 1,252 yards, six touchdowns and three interceptions, rushed 16 times for 23 yards and fumbled three times (one lost). </div> <h3 id="-jake-tonges-te">🟢 Jake Tonges (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Tonges continued doing his best George Kittle (hamstring) impression in another effective spot-start Sunday. The 25-year-old Tonges has been a pleasant surprise in fantasy during his brief run as the starter, posting a 25-223-3 receiving line through six games. David Lombardi of SFStandard.com reported that Kittle could return from injured reserve in Week 7, which would effectively end Tonges' run of utility. Managers should wait until Kittle is officially activated before making any rash decisions regarding Tonges in Week 7 and onward. </div> <h3 id="-chig-okonkwo-te">🟢 Chig Okonkwo (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Okonkwo's six targets Sunday tied his previous season high, while the six grabs set a new high-water mark through six starts. Aside from a one-catch dud in Week 4, the veteran tight end has carved out a consistent role in the passing game. Okonkwo will carry a 23-218-0 receiving line into next Sunday's tilt against the Patriots. </div> <hr> <h2 id="-lineup-analysis">📝 Lineup Analysis</h2> <h3 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h3> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_6_2025_TOM_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br></p> <h3 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h3> <p><small><em>What you should have started for maximum points</em></small></p> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_6_2025_TOM_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br></p> <hr> <h2 id="-week-7-optimal-projected-lineup">🔮 Week 7 Optimal Projected Lineup</h2> <div style="padding: 15px; background-color: #e7f3ff; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;"> <strong>Next Opponent:</strong> Americas Team<br> <strong>Total Projected Points:</strong> 112.65<br> </div> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_7_2025_TOM_projected.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> <th data-field="opponent" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="false">Opponent</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <hr> <h2 id="-remaining-schedule-analysis">📅 Remaining Schedule Analysis</h2> <div style="padding: 15px; background-color: #fff3cd; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;"> <strong>🔥 Average Opponent Strength:</strong> 120.96 PPG </div> <table class="table table-sm table-hover"> <thead><tr> <th>Opponent</th> <th>Record</th> <th>Avg Points</th> </tr></thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Americas Team</strong></td> <td>3-3</td> <td>131.31</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>To Infinity and Bijan!</strong></td> <td>2-4</td> <td>109.85</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Mcconky Donkeys</strong></td> <td>4-2</td> <td>109.85</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Third Time's the Charm?</strong></td> <td>5-1</td> <td>131.88</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>90s MonCon</strong></td> <td>3-3</td> <td>130.41</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Mama Daughter Duo</strong></td> <td>2-4</td> <td>134.29</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Big Titi Energy</strong></td> <td>1-5</td> <td>91.68</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Game of Zones - House Hamlin</strong></td> <td>4-2</td> <td>128.40</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> </article> <br> <hr> <br> <ul class="list-disc pl-8"></ul> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-6_links/">Week 6 Links</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-7_preview/">Week 7 Matchups Preview</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-6_Recap/">Week 6 League Recap</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-6-BTE/">Big Titi Energy Week 6 Report</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-6-TIB/">To Infinity and Bijan!
