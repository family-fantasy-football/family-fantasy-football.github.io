</code></pre> <hr> <h2 id="-player-report">🏥 Player Report</h2> <h3 id="-trey-mcbride-te">🟢 Trey McBride (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> McBride wasn't able extend his scoring streak to a sixth straight contest, which turned out to be the only blemish on another strong fantasy outing in Week 12. The star tight end utilized the overtime period to tack on a pair of short receptions in order to create a new personal streak of recording nine or more catches, which currently sits at three games. McBride has gone on an absolute tear since Jacoby Brissett took over under center for an injured Kyler Murray (foot) back in Week 6. The unexpected connection of Brissett to McBride has generated 51 receptions for 522 yards and six touchdowns in the six games the duo has started this season. There is little reason to believe that McBride can be contained by the Buccaneers' defense next Sunday. </div> <h3 id="-chuba-hubbard-rb">🟢 Chuba Hubbard (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Hubbard saw half the amount of carries of backfield mate Rico Dowdle, remaining in a clear No. 2 role behind the latter. Hubbard did draw even with Dowdle in receptions and targets due to a game script that saw the Panthers have to rely heavily on the pass as the game went on. Hubbard should handle a similar workload in a Week 13 home matchup against the Rams on Sunday. </div> <h3 id="-kyle-monangai-rb">🟢 Kyle Monangai (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Monangai's backfield mate D'Andre Swift gained just 15 yards on eight carries and also lost a fumble, leading to a bigger workload for the former. Monangai made good on the additional opportunity, recording a two-yard touchdown run early in the fourth quarter for his third consecutive game with a score. Monangai also encouragingly logged double-digit carries for the third time in four games, so he appears to have retained a serviceable role in the ground attack alongside Swift. </div> <h3 id="-jamarr-chase-wr">🟢 Ja’Marr Chase (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Chase received a one-game suspension for his role in an incident with Steelers defensive back Jalen Ramsey in Week 11, meaning the former sat out Sunday's defeat to the Patriots. Chase technically has a roster exemption after the ban was lifted, but he'll almost certainly be available for Thursday's road matchup with the Ravens, when the Bengals are expected to have No. 1 QB Joe Burrow (toe) back in the lineup. </div> <h3 id="-joe-burrow-qb">🔴 Joe Burrow (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Injured Reserve<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br> <strong>Details:</strong> All signs continue to point to Burrow returning to the lineup Thursday night against the Ravens. Coach Zac Taylor said earlier Monday that he anticipates Burrow being under center versus Baltimore, and Burrow himself posted on social media, indicating he's playing Week 13. It will be Burrow's first action since Week 2, when he suffered a turf toe injury that required surgery. </div> <h3 id="-david-montgomery-rb">🟢 David Montgomery (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br> <strong>Details:</strong> The veteran back failed to reach 40 scrimmage yards for the second straight game, but Montgomery simply wasn't needed much on a day in which Jahmyr Gibbs erupted for 264 scrimmage yards and three totals TDs. Montgomery has gone three straight games without getting into the end zone, his longest drought in three seasons with the Lions, but he could have a bigger role in Week 13 during a Thanksgiving tilt against the Packers. </div> <h3 id="-christian-watson-wr">🟢 Christian Watson (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Watson set the pace across the board for the Packers' air attack in receptions, receiving yards and targets on a day when Jordan Love completed only 14 passes for 139 yards. Watson arguably boasts the most stable floor of any Green Bay receiver in his team's frequently low-volume passing game for the moment, as he's now recorded 45 receiving yards or more in all five games, while logging at least four targets in each contest as well. Watson could be in for his busiest day yet when the Packers visit the Lions for a Thanksgiving Day showdown. </div> <h3 id="-dalton-schultz-te">🟢 Dalton Schultz (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Schultz, who battled through a shoulder injury on a short week, had his fewest targets since Week 8. Houston's offense got off to another slow start behind quarterback Davis Mills, and it greatly benefited from the defense, which forced three turnovers and created two short-field opportunities. Those factors kept a lid on the air attack. Despite the low output, Schultz remains a key component of the team's passing game and ranks second on the club with 72 targets and 497 receiving yards. </div> <h3 id="-josh-downs-wr">🟢 Josh Downs (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Downs again took a back seat to Michael Pittman and Tyler Warren (five receptions each) in the intermediate passing game. After recording touchdowns in three consecutive games, Downs has just three receptions for 13 yards his last two games. He'll face a tough matchup against a stout defense next week against Houston. </div> <h3 id="-travis-etienne-jr-rb">🟢 Travis Etienne Jr. (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Etienne and Bhayshul Tuten (ankle) both shed their respective injury tags from last week's win over the Chargers, but it was the former who dominated the backfield touches against the Cardinals on Sunday. Tuten (7-17-0) struggled in his limited role while Etienne more than doubled his teammate's touches with greater efficiency overall. This comes as a relief for Etienne's fantasy managers after the talented rushing duo split work evenly in last week's victory. Etienne will look to keep the good times rolling against the lowly Titans next Sunday after hitting pay dirt four times over his last three contests. </div> <h3 id="-matthew-stafford-qb">🟢 Matthew Stafford (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Stafford got back to his league-dominating ways after posting pedestrian passing numbers (by his lofty standards) in a win over the Seahawks last Sunday. The 37-year-old dissected Tampa Bay's 26th-ranked pass defense, ending Sunday Night Football with his sixth game throwing three or more touchdowns with no interceptions in 11 starts this season. Stafford is playing some of the best football of his career in his 16th season, throwing for 2,830 yards with an outstanding 30:2 TD:INT as the Rams prepare to visit the Panthers next Sunday. </div> <h3 id="-rhamondre-stevenson-rb">🟢 Rhamondre Stevenson (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Returning from a three-game absence due to a toe issue, Stevenson found himself firmly behind TreVeyon Henderson in the backfield pecking order, as the rookie turned 21 touches into 81 scrimmage yards. Stevenson was deployed at the goal line Sunday, but he got stuffed for no gain on two carries from the Bengals' one-line line in the third quarter. That usage could allow him to maintain some fantasy value, but Stevenson appears to be the clear No. 2 option in the New England running game heading into a Week 13 meeting with the Giants. </div> <h3 id="-aj-brown-wr">🟢 A.J. Brown (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Brown was a key to the Eagles' hot start on offense, as he posted five receptions for 67 yards and a touchdown combined across the team's first two drives. While he slowed significantly from that pace, Brown still managed to top 100 receiving yards for the third time this season while also recording his first catch of at least 20 yards since Week 7. Philadelphia's passing attack looks likely to remain inconsistent, though a Week 13 matchup against the Bears should present Brown with another opportunity for a solid performance. </div> <h3 id="-cooper-kupp-wr">🟢 Cooper Kupp (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Once again, the Seattle passing attack ran through Jaxon Smith-Njigba, who hauled in eight passes on 10 targets for 167 yards and two touchdowns. Kupp tied for second on the team in targets but failed to produce much for fantasy purposes. He has just 31 receptions for 414 yards and a touchdown through 10 games this year. Kupp draws a tough Week 13 test against the Vikings' seventh-ranked pass defense. </div> <h3 id="-sam-darnold-qb">🟢 Sam Darnold (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Darnold bounced back from a terrible performance against the Rams and delivered an efficient stat line in a favorable matchup. He unsurprisingly found most of his success when targeting Jaxon Smith-Njigba, connecting with his star receiver for long gains of 63 and 56 yards -- the former of which went for a touchdown -- in addition to a 13-yard score. While Darnold has performed well for the majority of the season, the Seahawks still prefer to rely on their running game and defense to win games, limiting Darnold's pass attempts. He's now failed to reach 30 pass attempts in three of his last four games, making him very reliant upon big plays and touchdowns to deliver good fantasy lines. </div> <h3 id="-jaxon-smith-njigba-wr">🟢 Jaxon Smith-Njigba (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Smith-Njigba was the only threat in the Seattle passing game, as he accounted for half of Sam Darnold's completions and over two-thirds of his passing yards. That damage came primarily on a pair of receptions over 50 yards, including a 63-yard catch deep down the right sideline to begin the second quarter. The second was a 56-yard grab, which he followed up with a 13-yard score two plays later. Smith-Njigba set a season-high in receiving yards with the performance and now has 100 yards in eight of his 11 contests. </div> <h3 id="-tory-horton-wr">🟢 Tory Horton (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Injured Reserve<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> ir </div> <hr> <h2 id="-lineup-analysis">📝 Lineup Analysis</h2> <h3 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h3> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_12_2025_RRT_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br></p> <h3 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h3> <p><small><em>What you should have started for maximum points</em></small></p> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_12_2025_RRT_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br></p> <hr> <h2 id="-week-13-optimal-projected-lineup">🔮 Week 13 Optimal Projected Lineup</h2> <div style="padding: 15px; background-color: #e7f3ff; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;"> <strong>Next Opponent:</strong> 90s MonCon<br> <strong>Total Projected Points:</strong> 142.01<br> </div> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_13_2025_RRT_projected.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> <th data-field="opponent" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="false">Opponent</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <hr> <h2 id="-remaining-schedule-analysis">📅 Remaining Schedule Analysis</h2> <div style="padding: 15px; background-color: #fff3cd; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;"> <strong>🔥 Average Opponent Strength:</strong> 125.06 PPG </div> <table class="table table-sm table-hover"> <thead><tr> <th>Opponent</th> <th>Record</th> <th>Avg Points</th> </tr></thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>90s MonCon</strong></td> <td>4-8</td> <td>123.08</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Mama Daughter Duo</strong></td> <td>7-5</td> <td>127.04</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> </article> <br> <hr> <br> <ul class="list-disc pl-8"></ul> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-15_links/">Week 15 Links</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-16_preview/">Week 16 Matchups Preview</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-15_Recap/">Week 15 League Recap</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-15-EET/">Emma's Excellent Team Week 15 Report</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-15-TIB/">To Infinity and Bijan!
