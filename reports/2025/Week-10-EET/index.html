</code></pre> <hr> <h2 id="-player-report">🏥 Player Report</h2> <h3 id="-drake-london-wr">🟢 Drake London (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br> <strong>Details:</strong> No other Falcons pass catcher hauled in more than two passes or gained more than 38 yards, as London continues to be Michael Penix's only reliable downfield option. Sunday marked the fourth time in his last five games that London has topped 100 receiving yards, and he's up to six TDs in nine games, including four in the last two weeks. The fourth-year wideout will look to keep rolling in Week 11 against the Panthers, a team he's scored four touchdowns against in seven career meetings. </div> <h3 id="-justice-hill-rb">🟢 Justice Hill (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> The Ravens used Hill a bit more than they did in Week 9 when he played a season-low 11 snaps. Hill was out there for 19 snaps on offense (27 percent) and made the most of his two touches, picking up a first down on his one catch. Hill's goal-line opportunity was his first such carry of the season and his first red-zone carry since Week 4. He remains a part of the offense as the main backup to Derrick Henry, but he rarely sees even five touches in a given game. </div> <h3 id="-joshua-palmer-wr">🟡 Joshua Palmer (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable </div> <h3 id="-courtland-sutton-wr">🟢 Courtland Sutton (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Sutton put together another quiet performance, finishing with his third sub-30-yard performance in the last five games. The veteran wideout also has four or fewer catches in four of the last five games, a stark departure from the first five games of the season, when he posted a 26-365-3 receiving line on 37 targets. Sutton should have a good chance of reverting to a higher-volume role in Week 11, however, as the Chiefs pay a visit for a critical divisional showdown on Sunday, Nov. 16. </div> <h3 id="-jakobi-meyers-wr">🟢 Jakobi Meyers (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Making his Jaguars debut after coming over from the Raiders at the trade deadline, Meyers had the longest reception of the day from Trevor Lawrence at 23 yards, but he was out-paced by Parker Washington in targets 7-3. Meyers will look to continue to build chemistry with his new QB in Week 11 against a familiar AFC West foe in the Chargers, and his volume should rise if Brian Thomas (ankle) remains sidelined for a second straight game. </div> <h3 id="-trevor-lawrence-qb">🟢 Trevor Lawrence (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br> <strong>Details:</strong> The fifth-year quarterback had a tough day against a fierce Houston defense, getting sacked five times and committing two fumbles, losing one of them. Lawrence has thrown for multiple TDs only twice in nine games to begin the season, and on the year he has a rough 10:7 TD:INT. He faces another stingy opponent in Week 11 against the Chargers, a matchup that could be even tougher if Brian Thomas (ankle) remains sidelined. </div> <h3 id="-hollywood-brown-wr">🟢 Hollywood Brown (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Brown resurfaced after being held without a catch in last week's rout of the Raiders. The Chiefs were playing from behind for most of this contest, which helps explain the deep threat's increased involvement Sunday. Brown's four targets checked in at fourth among Kansas City receiving options, a trend that should continue moving forward now that the team's receiving corps is back to full strength. Brown's reduced role should keep him in deep-league territory for fantasy purposes against the Broncos in Week 10. </div> <h3 id="-aaron-jones-sr-rb">🟢 Aaron Jones Sr. (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Jones' line doesn't stand out on the surface, but he served as Minnesota's clear lead back -- a departure from the split the Vikings have used to this point in the season. He out-touched Jordan Mason 12-5 for the game, which included the majority of targets and the team's lone running back touch at the goal line. Jones took advantage of the latter opportunity by punching in a four-yard touchdown for his first trip to the end zone this season. The Vikings were forced to utilize a pass-heavy offense while chasing the score, but Jones could be in line for heavier workloads moving forward. </div> <h3 id="-saquon-barkley-rb">🟢 Saquon Barkley (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Barkley used the Eagles' bye week to fully recover from a minor groin injury suffered at the tail end of a Week 8 win over the Giants. The 28-year-old superstar was stymied on the ground by Green Bay's defense, but he still reached the century mark in total yards with an efficient night as a receiver. Barkley has been an obvious disappointment when comparing his 2025 results to his MVP-caliber campaign last year, but he's still producing a solid fantasy season with 779 total yards and six touchdowns through nine starts. The reigning Super Bowl champions will stick in a primetime slot for a Week 11 matchup against the Lions on Sunday Night Football. </div> <h3 id="-brock-purdy-qb">🟡 Brock Purdy (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br> <strong>Details:</strong> As it pertains to Purdy's first appearance since Week 4 due to a turf toe injury, Shanahan told David Lombardi of SFStandard.com that the 49ers "want three aggressive practices [from him], and we want to hear from him and make sure he feels good after them, too." This follows Shanahan's comments from Sunday, in which he relayed that Purdy "hopefully" will "have a chance this week," per Ian Rapoport of NFL Network. Wednesday's injury report ultimately will reveal Purdy's initial activity level for Week 11 prep, but if he's listed as full, it'll be a good indication that he's trending toward a return to action Sunday at Arizona. Mac Jones so far has earned eight spot starts in place of Purdy this season. </div> <h3 id="-george-kittle-te">🔴 George Kittle (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br> <strong>Details:</strong> It took a one-sided loss to do it, but Kittle finally produced the kind of stat line managers were hoping for when selecting the tight end early in drafts. The star tight end has chipped three touchdown catches across five active games, with Sunday's output marking the first time he surpassed four receptions or 43 receiving yards. The injury-riddled 49ers may need to rely on Kittle's receiving abilities in order to remain a threat down the stretch. </div> <h3 id="-rashid-shaheed-wr">🟢 Rashid Shaheed (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> It was a shaky debut for Shaheed after being dealt to Seattle at last week's trade deadline. It could have been a worse outing with his new club had a teammate not recovered a fumble on one of the receiver's three touches on offense. The low volume is concerning, but it is worth noting that the Seahawks attempted just 12 passes in Sunday's blowout victory. Players also need time to get fully integrated into a new offensive system, so managers should not overreact to the dud in the box score. Shaheed averaged 7.3 targets prior to the trade as New Orleans' No. 2 receiver, so expect more looks to come his way against the Rams next Sunday as he continues to get acquainted with Seattle's offense. </div> <h3 id="-tony-pollard-rb">🟢 Tony Pollard (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Pollard out-carried Tyjae Spears 10-7, though the touches were nearly identical when taking into account receptions. Unlike past weeks, Pollard was the more efficient back, as he opened the game with rushes of 16 and 12 yards on Tennessee's first possession. While there were some positives to take away from the performance, Pollard hasn't found the end zone since Week 5, and the split in touches will likely continue to hamper his fantasy outlook. </div> <h3 id="-zach-ertz-te">🟢 Zach Ertz (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Ertz was among Marcus Mariota's favorite targets, tying for the team lead in both targets and receptions while finishing second in yardage. He accounted for most of his production with the Commanders chasing the score, including long catches of 30 and 12 yards. This was Ertz's best performance with Mariota under center, though he'll head into a potentially high-scoring matchup against the Dolphins in Week 11. </div> <hr> <h2 id="-lineup-analysis">📝 Lineup Analysis</h2> <h3 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h3> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_10_2025_EET_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br></p> <h3 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h3> <p><small><em>What you should have started for maximum points</em></small></p> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_10_2025_EET_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br></p> <hr> <h2 id="-week-11-optimal-projected-lineup">🔮 Week 11 Optimal Projected Lineup</h2> <div style="padding: 15px; background-color: #e7f3ff; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;"> <strong>Next Opponent:</strong> To Infinity and Bijan!<br> <strong>Total Projected Points:</strong> 97.87<br> </div> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_11_2025_EET_projected.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> <th data-field="opponent" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="false">Opponent</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <hr> <h2 id="-remaining-schedule-analysis">📅 Remaining Schedule Analysis</h2> <div style="padding: 15px; background-color: #fff3cd; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;"> <strong>⚠️ Average Opponent Strength:</strong> 109.38 PPG </div> <table class="table table-sm table-hover"> <thead><tr> <th>Opponent</th> <th>Record</th> <th>Avg Points</th> </tr></thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>To Infinity and Bijan!</strong></td> <td>3-7</td> <td>106.18</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Abbey's TNT Team</strong></td> <td>6-4</td> <td>116.83</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Mcconky Donkeys</strong></td> <td>5-5</td> <td>108.33</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>To Infinity and Bijan!</strong></td> <td>3-7</td> <td>106.18</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> </article> <br> <hr> <br> <ul class="list-disc pl-8"></ul> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-15_links/">Week 15 Links</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-16_preview/">Week 16 Matchups Preview</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-15_Recap/">Week 15 League Recap</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-15-EET/">Emma's Excellent Team Week 15 Report</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-15-TIB/">To Infinity and Bijan!
