</code></pre> <hr> <h2 id="-player-report">🏥 Player Report</h2> <h3 id="-michael-wilson-wr">🟢 Michael Wilson (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Wilson is taking full advantage of teammate Marvin Harrison's (appendix) continued absence, with the former producing his second 100-plus yard performance in his second game operating as Arizona's top wideout. The ascension of veteran backup Jacoby Brissett's game since taking over for Kyler Murray (foot) can also be attributed to Wilson's rapid rise in the fantasy ranks. It is unclear how long Harrison will remained sidelined while recovering from appendix surgery, but it has become clear that Wilson should be treated as a must-start option in fantasy until that day comes. Harrison hasn't been ruled out for next Sunday's tilt in Tampa Bay, but there is reason to believe that Wilson could remain fantasy relevant even after his teammate's return given the way the Cardinals are airing the ball out. </div> <h3 id="-kirk-cousins-qb">🟢 Kirk Cousins (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Cousins earned his first win of the 2025 season in his second start for the Falcons after it was announced that starter Michael Penix (knee) will miss the remainder of the year. The 36-year-old Cousins experienced greater success compared to his spot-start in a loss to the Dolphins back in Week 8 and a pair of relief appearances that netted zero combined touchdowns. The highly-paid backup is unlikely to reach the elite levels of production we were used to seeing back in his heyday playing for Washington and Minnesota, but he proved on Sunday that he can still operate an NFL offense at a respectable level. Cousins will face another soft matchup against the Jets next Sunday, putting him on the map in deeper formats as a potential bye week or injury replacement. </div> <h3 id="-lamar-jackson-qb">🟡 Lamar Jackson (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br> <strong>Details:</strong> In Week 11, knee soreness led to a Wednesday 'DNP' for Jackson, while in Week 12 an ankle issue was cited for the QB's absence that Wednesday. This time around, Jackson is listed with a toe injury, but at this stage there's nothing to suggest that his status for Thursday's game against the Bengals is in any danger. Tuesday's injury report will provide further context on that front, but it's worth noting that each of the last two weeks Jackson practiced fully both Thursday and Friday. </div> <h3 id="-quinshon-judkins-rb">🟢 Quinshon Judkins (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Judkins produced touchdown runs of eight yards and two yards in the first quarter, both of which came out of the wildcat formation, with Judkins taking the snap directly. He went into the medical tent twice to be evaluated for a head injury in the fourth quarter, per Daniel Oyefusi of ESPN.com, but Judkins gained clearance to return to the game. Judkins remains Cleveland's top backfield option on the ground, but fellow rookie Dylan Sampson has impressed as a pass catcher on a few occasions, and Sampson had a 66-yard touchdown reception on one of his nine touches Sunday. If the Browns can stay within striking distance, Judkins will likely get another hefty rushing workload in Week 13 against the 49ers. </div> <h3 id="-jameson-williams-wr">🟢 Jameson Williams (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Williams logged at least four catches, six targets and a touchdown in each of his last three games prior to Week 12. However, the fourth-year wideout wasn't able to carry that momentum into Sunday's game, as Jared Goff frequently looked toward Amon-Ra St. Brown (12 targets) and Jahmyr Gibbs (11 targets) in the passing game. Williams appeared to get on the board with a 36-yard catch early in the third quarter, but it was negated by a penalty on offensive lineman Graham Glasgow. Sunday marked the second time this season that Williams did not record a catch, and he'll look to bounce back in the Lions' Thanksgiving Day game against the Packers. </div> <h3 id="-emanuel-wilson-rb">🟢 Emanuel Wilson (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Wilson drew the start in place of Josh Jacobs (knee) and handled a workload befitting his sidelined teammate, as the former logged a career-high carry total. Wilson clawed his way to his first career 100-yard game in the process, and he got into the end zone on a pair of one-yard scoring runs in the first and third quarters. Jacobs has a decent chance to be available for a critical road matchup against the Lions on Thanksgiving, but if the latter is held out, the Packers will certainly have confidence in Wilson's ability to handle a lead-back role for a second straight game. </div> <h3 id="-jonathan-taylor-rb">🟢 Jonathan Taylor (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br> <strong>Details:</strong> The Chiefs' defense did a number on Taylor, with the star running back finishing under 60 rushing yards for only the second time in 11 games. Taylor was coming off a season-high 244 rushing yards and three rushing scores in Week 10 against the Falcons before the Colts' bye, and Sunday also marked only the second time this season he failed to record more than one run of double-digit yardage. Taylor will aim to regroup at the expense of a tough Texans defense in a Week 13 home matchup next Sunday. </div> <h3 id="-brock-bowers-te">🟢 Brock Bowers (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Bowers produced a modest receiving line while finishing second on the team behind WR Tre Tucker in targets (10) and RB Ashton Jeanty in receptions (eight). While the final results were digestible, Bowers' managers are left wondering what could have been had QB Geno Smith looked the star tight end's way more often instead of taking numerous unsuccessful deep shots to Tucker. Poor playcalling and quarterback play aside, Bowers remains an elite fantasy option week in, week out based on pure talent alone. Expect Bowers to remain a focal point of the passing offense for the struggling Raiders in next Sunday's road tilt against the Chargers. </div> <h3 id="-oronde-gadsden-ii-te">🟢 Oronde Gadsden II (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Gadsden had just one catch for 13 yards until late in the fourth quarter when he caught a 28-yard pass from backup quarterback Trey Lance when the game was well out of hand. It was a challenge most of the afternoon for the Los Angeles offense, as Justin Herbert threw for just 81 yards prior to being removed from the blowout loss. After big production in October, Gadsden has cooled off in back-to-back weeks, with just five catches for 54 yards on 11 targets over the past two games. The Chargers have a Week 12 bye before hosting the Raiders at home in Week 13. </div> <h3 id="-kimani-vidal-rb">🟢 Kimani Vidal (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Vidal had exited the contest due to a thigh issue, but he was able to return to the Chargers' Week 11 backfield, which also includes Amar Johnson and Trayveon Williams. </div> <h3 id="-jaylen-waddle-wr">🟢 Jaylen Waddle (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Waddle's yardage total wasn't anything to write home about, but it was good enough to lead the Dolphins on a day when Tua Tagovailoa threw for only 171 yards. Waddle also paced Miami in targets and contributed a game-long 31-yard grab, and he's now eclipsed 50 receiving yards in six of the last seven games overall, including four straight. Waddle will next take aim at the Saints secondary in a Week 13 home matchup on Sunday, Nov. 30 following a Week 12 bye. </div> <h3 id="-tua-tagovailoa-qb">🟢 Tua Tagovailoa (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Tagovailoa's final line underscores the game manager role he played in the overseas win, one in which he withstood three sacks but still managed a solid 8.6 yards per attempt. The veteran signal-caller worked with a tight circle of five targets, and the fact he was able to remain turnover-free for only the second time in the last six games may have been as encouraging an aspect of his performance as any. Tagovailoa has thrown for under 200 yards in each of the last two contests heading into the Week 12 bye, but Miami has notably recorded victories in both contests. </div> <h3 id="-jordan-addison-wr">🟢 Jordan Addison (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Addison's opportunities were part of the collateral damage of J.J. McCarthy's utterly forgettable afternoon, as he threw for just 87 yards and two interceptions. The speedy wideout was essentially ignored in the passing game, logging his lowest target total of the season. While it may be accurate to say there's nowhere to go but up for Addison in a Week 13 road battle against the Seahawks, the matchup is less than appealing on paper. </div> <h3 id="-jaylen-warren-rb">🟢 Jaylen Warren (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Warren was cleared Friday from an ankle injury, though there was still some question as to whether he'd handle his typical workload. However, he matched his season high with 18 carries and reached at least 60 rushing yards for the third straight game. Warren also found the end zone for only the fourth time this season on a one-yard plunge late in the second quarter. Warren remains the traditional lead back for Pittsburgh despite ceding work as a pass catcher, and he's a reliable, if unspectacular, contributor. </div> <h3 id="-tyjae-spears-rb">🟢 Tyjae Spears (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Spears continued to work as a complement to Tony Pollard, as he had only three rush attempts to Pollard's 11. Spears has now been held to single-digit rushing yards in each of his last two contests. Positively, he has remained involved as a pass catcher, recording at least three receptions in six straight games. </div> <hr> <h2 id="-lineup-analysis">📝 Lineup Analysis</h2> <h3
