</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="james-conner-rb">James Conner (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Out <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Conner exited Sunday’s loss at San Francisco early in the third quarter with what initially was termed an ankle injury, which was severe enough for Adam Schefter of ESPN to report that the running back’s 2025 campaign was over. Now that Conner’s coach has confirmed as much as well as the true nature of the injury, he’ll end the season with 32 carries for 95 yards and one touchdown and eight catches (on nine targets) for 38 yards and another score in three games. Trey Benson is expected to lead Arizona’s backfield moving forward, but Emari Demercado also should get the occasional rep on game days.</p> <h4 id="zay-flowers-wr">Zay Flowers (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br> <strong>Details:</strong> After coming into the night with an impressive 14-218-1 line that he’d generated over the first two games of the season, Flowers crashed down to earth in the interconference clash. The 2023 first-round pick’s downturn was precipitated by a significant drop in targets, as he drew just three looks from Lamar Jackson after seeing a combined 20 over the first pair of contests. Flowers is likely to be much more involved in another potential wire-to-wire battle versus the Chiefs on the road in Week 4.</p> <h4 id="rashod-bateman-wr">Rashod Bateman (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Bateman finished second in receptions and receiving yards for the Ravens behind Mark Andrews, while also setting the pace in targets. Bateman recorded his first touchdown of the season on a three-yard grab just before halftime, and the fifth-year pro has now upped his yardage total over that of the prior game in consecutive contests heading into a Week 4 road showdown with the Chiefs on Sunday afternoon.</p> <h4 id="derrick-henry-rb">Derrick Henry (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Henry was coming off a disappointing 11-carry, 23-yard performance against a tough Browns defense, so in that regard, Monday’s production was encouraging on the surface. The multi-time Pro Bowler also recorded his third rushing touchdown of the season on a 28-yard run in the first quarter that answered an early Lions score. However, that was easily overshadowed by Henry’s second critical fourth-quarter fumble over the first three games of the season, as he was stripped of the ball at his own 22-yard line with 8:31 remaining and Baltimore trying to overcome a 28-24 deficit. Detroit was able to add three more critical points as a result of the highly favorable field position, helping lead to the victory. Henry and his teammates won’t have much time to dwell on Monday night’s outcome, however, as a road trip to Kansas City for a Week 4 showdown with the Chiefs awaits this coming Sunday.</p> <h4 id="josh-allen-qb">Josh Allen (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Allen finished with a sparkling 134.1 QB rating in the divisional win, which may have been more tightly contested than initially expected. As a result, the star signal-caller was appreciably more involved through the air than during a comfortable Week 2 win against the Jets, completing passes to nine different targets overall. Allen’s first two scoring tosses went to tight ends Dalton Kincaid (20 yards) and Jackson Hawes (five yards), the latter a nifty heave while on the run. Allen closed out his night with a 15-yard strike to Khalil Shakir midway through the fourth quarter to snap a 21-21 tie, and he’ll head into a Week 4 home date against the Saints on Sunday, Sept. 28 with an unblemished 5:0 TD:INT and career-best 69.7 percent completion rate through his first three contests.</p> <h4 id="cedric-tillman-wr">Cedric Tillman (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Tillman, who had 15 targets and two touchdowns through the first two weeks, was kept out of the end zone for the first time and had his fewest targets of the season. The production drop in Week 3 has more to do with Cleveland’s sputtering offense and shouldn’t be seen as a designed plan to reduce Tillman’s role. He’s been on the field for 86 percent of the offensive snaps, second only to Jerry Jeudy (86.5 percent) among the Browns wide receivers.</p> <h4 id="amon-ra-st-brown-wr">Amon-Ra St. Brown (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br> <strong>Details:</strong> St. Brown carried over the momentum from his standout three-score game against the Bears last week into Monday’s tilt, where he posted prototypical WR1 numbers on the road against the Ravens. The 25-year-old shook his assignment with a double move in the third quarter to hit pay dirt for the fourth time this season. The star wideout also chipped in an assist that will not show up in the box score when he pitched the ball to Jahmyr Gibbs on a fourth-down option play that resulted in a touchdown for his teammate. St. Brown will boast a pristine 20-237-4 receiving line heading into a Week 4 matchup against Cleveland on Sunday.</p> <h4 id="sam-laporta-te">Sam LaPorta (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> LaPorta remained somewhat quiet Week 3, finishing third on the team in catches, targets and receiving yards. The tight end has still yet to find the end zone, though he’s seen three red-zone targets over three games. Through three weeks, he’s compiled 13 receptions (on 17 targets) for 138 yards. LaPorta will look to find pay dirt Week 4 against the Browns, who have allowed two touchdowns to tight ends so far this season.</p> <h4 id="jordan-love-qb">Jordan Love (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Love’s final stat line – not to mention the final score – both hint plenty at what type of day it was for the Packers offense, and additional insight can be gleaned from the fact Love was sacked five times and hit seven times overall. The talented signal-caller had a tight circle of six targets overall in his first full game of 2025 without Jayden Reed (IR-collarbone/foot), and his interception at his own 29-yard line with just over three minutes remaining set the Browns up for a game-tying touchdown. Love has thrown for under 200 yards in two of his first three games, but he takes an impressive 5:1 TD:INT into a Week 4 Sunday night road matchup against the Cowboys.</p> <h4 id="tucker-kraft-te">Tucker Kraft (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> The knee injury Kraft suffered in Thursday’s practice didn’t prevent the talented tight end from suiting up, but the Packers’ passing game as a whole was frequently overwhelmed by a ferocious Browns defense that brought Jordan Love down five times and picked him off once. Kraft’s totals were in stark contrast to his breakout 6-124-1 line against the Commanders in Week 2, but he’ll likely be healthier when the Packers pay a visit to the Cowboys for a Week 4 showdown next Sunday night.</p> <h4 id="juju-smith-schuster-wr">JuJu Smith-Schuster (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Smith-Schuster saw regular run on offense Sunday with Xavier Worthy (shoulder) out and Rashee Rice suspended, but he was unable to capitalize on the increase in opportunity. With Worthy potentially returning to action this Sunday against the Giants, Smith-Schuster is a candidate to see a reduction in snaps.</p> <h4 id="najee-harris-rb">Najee Harris (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Out <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Harris will need to undergo surgery and miss the remainder of the season due to the severity of the injury he suffered Week 3 against Denver. The 27-year-old running back inked a one-year contract with Los Angeles for the 2025 campaign, positioning him to hit free agency next offseason. With Harris done for the year, rookie first-round pick Omarion Hampton becomes clearly entrenched as the No. 1 backfield option for a high-scoring Chargers offense, and 2024 sixth-rounder Kimani Vidal becomes a likely candidate to be brought off the practice squad as additional depth alongside return-game specialist Hassan Haskins.</p> <h4 id="keenan-allen-wr">Keenan Allen (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Allen made a terrific adjustment on a broken play in the fourth quarter, jumping through the defender to snare a 20-yard touchdown that tied the game. If it wasn’t clear through the first two weeks, it’s obvious now that the veteran is clearly Justin Herbert’s preferred target – especially when a play breaks down – and the duo’s uncanny connection has only become more potent with the emergence of Quentin Johnston (six catches on 10 targets for 89 yards) alongside the reliable Ladd McConkey. Allen has now led the team in targets for three straight weeks and continues to be a key piece of dominant offense.</p> <h4 id="sterling-shepard-wr">Sterling Shepard (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Shepard put together his best game of the season, finishing just five yards short of rookie Emeka Egbuka’s team-high total. The veteran slot receiver has an 11-153-0 line on 15 targets through Tampa Bay’s first three games while taking advantage of the absence of Chris Godwin (ankle), but even if Godwin is ready to make his season debut in Week 4 against the Eagles, Shepard’s role may not decrease immediately as Mike Evans left Sunday’s win in the fourth quarter with a hamstring injury.</p> <h4 id="cam-ward-qb">Cam Ward (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Hardegree was hired as Callahan’s QBs coach ahead of the 2024 season and has very limited experience calling offensive plays in the NFL, only doing it with the Raiders in 2023 after coach Josh McDaniels and OC Joe Lombardi were fired during the season. However, the Titans simply needed to make a change. Entering Week 4, Tennessee is 31st in yards per game, 32nd in touchdowns scored, 32nd in passing yards and 32nd in sacks allowed. There’s simply nowhere to go but up for the Titans. Averaging a mere 8.4 fantasy points per game through three weeks, rookie No. 1 overall pick Cam Ward is fantasy’s QB36.</p> <h4 id="jacory-croskey-merritt-rb">Jacory Croskey-Merritt (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> The Commanders rolled with a committee in the wake of Austin Ekeler (Achilles) being lost for the season, and Croskey-Merritt scored one of the team’s three rushing TDs on the afternoon, with QB Marcus Mariota and Jeremy McNichols getting the others. McNichols’ 60-yard touchdown stole the show, but Chris Rodriguez led the backfield with 11 carries, and JCM made his impact with a one-yard plunge in the third quarter. The rookie has 125 rushing yards and two TDs on an impressive 5.7 yards per carry through his first three NFL games, but given the offense’s success in this one, he seems unlikely to get a big increase in volume in Week 4 against the Falcons.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table"
