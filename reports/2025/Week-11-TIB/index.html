</code></pre> <hr> <h2 id="-player-report">🏥 Player Report</h2> <h3 id="-darnell-mooney-wr">🟢 Darnell Mooney (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Sunday's contest marked the second time that Mooney caught multiple passes in a game since Week 7. The veteran wideout, however, was unable to turn these touches into significant production. Mooney's underwhelming performances this season have been a major disappointment, but he has the opportunity to see more involvement in the games passing attack with teammate Drake London (knee) considered week-to-week with a sprained PCL suffered in Week 11. The 28-year-old Mooney will step into the No. 1 spot on the wide receiver depth chart, so he should see a significant uptick in targets in the passing attack. With that said, he'll be catching passes from quarterback Kirk Cousins, as Michael Penix (knee) is on injured reserve. Mooney will look to make the most of his opportunity when the Falcons visit the Saints in Week 12. </div> <h3 id="-kyle-pitts-sr-te">🟢 Kyle Pitts Sr. (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Pitts finished behind Drake London (knee), Bijan Robinson and Darnell Mooney in terms of receiving yards in a matchup that saw Kirk Cousins take over the offense after Michael Penix (knee) was forced out in the third quarter. That leaves the Falcons' passing attack in flux as the team prepares for a Week 12 road matchup against the Saints, but that's potentially to Pitts' benefit. The 25-year-old tight end would likely see increased target volume if London misses any time, and when Cousins started versus the Dolphins in Week 8, he targeted Pitts nine times. </div> <h3 id="-mark-andrews-te">🟢 Mark Andrews (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Andrews was the unlikely hero in Sunday's comeback victory when he took a direct snap from under center -- attempting to convert on fourth and short -- that wound up going for 35 yards and the game-winning score. The veteran tight end managed to extend his modest touchdown streak to three games, albeit in an unexpected fashion (he previously had zero career rushing touchdowns). Andrews' recent scoring binge has elevated him into must-start territory against the Jets next Sunday. </div> <h3 id="-tetairoa-mcmillan-wr">🟢 Tetairoa McMillan (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> The 2025 first-round pick from Arizona had the best game of his young career in Sunday's win, setting new career highs in yards, touchdowns and receptions. He benefitted from quarterback Bryce Young's best performance as a pro, with Young finding him for scores in both the first and fourth quarter. Through his first 10 NFL games, McMillan has looked like a budding star, catching 54 of 89 targets for 748 yards and four touchdowns. He draws a great Week 12 matchup against a struggling 49ers defense and could be in line for another huge outing. </div> <h3 id="-javonte-williams-rb">🟢 Javonte Williams (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Williams topped 20 rushing attempts for the first time this season and turned in an efficient effort. Seven of his 22 attempts went for a gain of at least six yards, and he reached 80 rushing yards for the sixth time on the campaign. While it was a solid showing on the field, Williams' fantasy performance was something of a letdown, as he failed to find the end zone and remained uninvolved as a pass catcher. After tallying multiple catches in five of Dallas' first six contests, he has only one catch in four straight contests. </div> <h3 id="-josh-jacobs-rb">🟡 Josh Jacobs (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br> <strong>Details:</strong> The Packers will evaluate Jacobs again toward the end of the week, and the running back has yet to be ruled out for next Sunday's game against the Vikings. It's a best-case scenario for Jacobs, who was forced to leave Sunday's win over the Giants in the first half. In Jacobs' absence, Emanuel Wilson played a season-high 71 percent of the offensive snaps and rushed 11 times for 40 yards and one touchdown, adding one catch for nine yards on one target. Chris Brooks played just five offensive snaps and handled one carry for eight yards. If Jacobs needs to miss time, Wilson would become an immediate plug-and-play fantasy starter. </div> <h3 id="-nick-chubb-rb">🟢 Nick Chubb (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Chubb and backfield mate Woody Marks had the biggest gulf in workloads yet Sunday, with the former finishing with a season-low carry total. Chubb had also logged a modest five carries in Week 10 against the Jaguars, so he may set to play a complementary role to Marks down the stretch of regular season. </div> <h3 id="-davis-mills-qb">🟢 Davis Mills (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Mills put together another solid performance in his second start in place of C.J. Stroud (concussion) despite being subjected to plenty of pressure from what had been a porous Titans defense. Mills was taken down four times, but he also completed passes to eight different players while displaying good command of the offense. Mills capped the afternoon in fine fashion by leading a game-winning nine-play, 48-yard drive, and he's likely to draw another start in a Week 12 Thursday night home matchup against the Bills since Stroud may not be ready to play due to the short turnaround. </div> <h3 id="-quentin-johnston-wr">🟢 Quentin Johnston (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Justin Herbert was pulled early in the second half after the Chargers were manhandled on both sides of the ball. The entirety of the team's passing attack took a hit, but none more so than Johnston, who just garnered 10 targets in Week 10 against the Steelers. It's fair to assume the Chargers will get back on track after their bye against the lowly Raiders in Week 13 , but with difficult matchups against teams like the Eagles and Texans looming after that, as well as divisional clashes with Denver and Kansas City, this might not be the only game that proves to be rough sledding for Johnston. </div> <h3 id="-malik-washington-wr">🟢 Malik Washington (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Washington delivered his second-highest receiving yardage total of the season in the overseas victory, finishing tied for second in catches with Jaylen Waddle and third in yards. Washington also continued to fill his usual full-time returner role, and he now has at least 30 receiving yards in four of the last five games heading into Miami's Week 12 bye. </div> <h3 id="-justin-jefferson-wr">🟢 Justin Jefferson (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Jefferson accounted for 53 of J.J. McCarthy's 74 passing yards in the first half. All 76 of McCarthy's second-half passing yards came on Minnesota's go-ahead drive in the final minutes, which included an eight-yard catch by Jefferson. Unfortunately for the Vikings, Chicago answered with a game-winning field goal on the game's final possession. Jefferson is averaging just 54 receiving yards per game in McCarthy's five starts compared to 95 receiving yards in the five games started by Carson Wentz (shoulder). With Wentz done for the season, the Vikings will have little choice but to stick with the struggling McCarthy in Week 12 against the Packers. </div> <h3 id="-theo-johnson-te">🟢 Theo Johnson (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Johnson set career-high marks with seven catches for 75 yards the previous Sunday against Chicago, but he went back to something close to his usual level of production versus the Packers. That may have had something to do with a change at QB -- Jaxson Dart (concussion) didn't play, and the Giants elected to go with Jameis Winston rather than Russell Wilson behind center. Johnson's stat line Sunday was slightly better than his averages of 2.9 receptions for 26.6 yards over the first nine games of the campaign, and he seems to have built a decent weekly floor with at least three catches in seven of his past eight contests. Should Dart be able to return to action against Detroit on Sunday, Johnson's outlook would likely bump up a bit. </div> <h3 id="-justin-fields-qb">🟢 Justin Fields (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Fields improved as a passer slightly during New York's loss to the Patriots on Thursday Night Football in Week 11, completing 15 of 26 passes for 116 yards with a touchdown and no interceptions, but as has been the norm he did much of his damage on the ground with 11 carries for 67 yards and another TD. Despite the context of Fields working without top wideout Garrett Wilson (knee, IR), his struggles through the air now appear to have officially cost him his tenure as the Jets' starter. Expect head coach Aaron Glenn to confirm the QB change prior to New York next taking the practice field, which will occur Wednesday, at the latest. It remains to be seen whether Fields will work as the No. 2 option behind Taylor. </div> <h3 id="-chris-godwin-jr-wr">🟡 Chris Godwin Jr. (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa;
