</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="marvin-harrison-jr-wr">Marvin Harrison Jr. (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Harrison wound up leading Arizona with 44 receiving yards in a game during which the team generated just 159 yards of offense through the air. The sophomore receiver suffered an uncharacteristic drop on a wide-open deep shot from Kyler Murray that could have resulted in a lengthy touchdown. Harrison continues to flash potential, only to disappear at times like he did against Carolina last week (2-27-0). The high-pedigree receiver should be treated as a boom-or-bust play against the Seahawks on Thursday.</p> <h4 id="james-cook-rb">James Cook (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Cook served as the ideal complement to the exploits of Josh Allen through the air (228 yards, three touchdowns). The star running back had a game-long run of 26 yards, so he was able to consistently find running room throughout the night. The 2022 second-round pick also recorded his fourth rushing touchdown of the season on a two-yard run to cap off the first drive of the second half, and he’ll take a stellar figure of 5.4 yards per carry into a Week 4 home matchup against the Saints on Sunday, Sept. 28.</p> <h4 id="joe-burrow-qb">Joe Burrow (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Injured Reserve <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR <br> <strong>Details:</strong> While coach Zac Taylor declined to provide a timeline for Burrow’s recovery, a previous report by Ben Baby of ESPN aligns with Rapoport’s estimate that the QB will miss a minimum of three months. With that timetable in mind, Burrow could potentially return later this season, but in the meantime Jake Browning will serve as the Bengals’ No. 1 signal-caller.</p> <h4 id="jk-dobbins-rb">J.K. Dobbins (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> While his new team couldn’t secure the victory, Dobbins was able to have a strong game against his former club. The bruising tailback accrued nearly all of his production on an impressive three-play drive to open the second half, during which he took three consecutive carries for 66 yards all the way to the end zone. Dobbins finished the contest with nine more rushing attempts than backup RJ Harvey, cementing his status as Denver’s No. 1 option out of the backfield. The 26-year-old Dobbins will attempt to extend his current scoring streak to four games when the Broncos host the Bengals on Monday Night Football in Week 4.</p> <h4 id="jared-goff-qb">Jared Goff (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Goff failed to sniff last week’s five-touchdown effort in Monday’s primetime tilt, instead giving way to the running game to generate 218 yards of offense and four trips to the end zone. The Novato, CA native has already generated massive swings in production through just three weeks of action, making him a risky play in standard one-QB formats. Goff now will have to take on a brutal Cleveland defense Week 4, but at least Sunday’s contest will be at home, where the signal-caller generally has better splits throughout his career.</p> <h4 id="romeo-doubs-wr">Romeo Doubs (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Doubs’ final line was a emblematic of a tough day for Jordan Love overall against the Browns’ aggressive defense. The veteran wideout is expected to see elevated volume in some games while Jayden Reed (IR, collarbone/foot) remains out, but Sunday’s game environment didn’t allow for such a boost. However, Doubs could be exponentially more involved when the Packers travel to Dallas to face the Cowboys in a Sunday night Week 4 clash that presents as a much more favorable matchup.</p> <h4 id="matthew-golden-wr">Matthew Golden (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br> <strong>Details:</strong> The rookie first-round pick had struggled through his first two weeks as a pro while generating a 2-16-0 line on four targets in that span. Therefore, Sunday’s performance was essentially a mini-breakout by comparison, and in addition to producing a team-high receiving yardage figure, Golden also logged multiple rush attempts for the second consecutive contest. With Jayden Reed (IR, collarbone/foot) out for an extended period, Golden should progressively carve out a larger role in coming weeks.</p> <h4 id="tyler-warren-te">Tyler Warren (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Daniel Jones targeted his pass catchers evenly, as Warren was one of four players with between four and six targets. He had the worst statistical day of his rookie season given the lack of volume, though he did manage long gains of 15 and 17 yards. Warren’s weekly production may vary while competing for targets with Michael Pittman, Josh Downs and Alec Pierce, but he has already established himself as one of the more reliable fantasy tight ends.</p> <h4 id="travis-hunter-wr">Travis Hunter (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Hunter had a nice splash play on his one reception, his longest gain yet as a pro. However, the rookie also saw his lowest target total to date, leading to new lows in receptions and receiving yards as well. Meanwhile, Hunter was heavily involved on defense, but it would be accurate to say the Colorado product has been a significant disappointment as an offensive player over three games. Trevor Lawrence’s own struggles in Liam Coen’s offense certainly have a part to play, and perhaps the duo will have better chemistry in a Week 4 road trip to San Francisco.</p> <h4 id="dyami-brown-wr">Dyami Brown (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Before that, Brown had caught two of his three targets for seven yards. In his absence, Brian Thomas, Travis Hunter and Parker Washington figure to lead the Jaguars’ Week 3 WR corps.</p> <h4 id="ashton-jeanty-rb">Ashton Jeanty (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> The rookie running back failed to see a target for the first time in his brief career, but Jeanty did little with his six targets in his first two games, so it was little surprise to see his role as a pass catcher reduced. The 63 rushing yards did represent his best effort so far on the ground, but it was still far from a breakout performance for the sixth overall pick in the 2025 Draft. Jeanty stands a better chance of making an impact in Week 4 against a Bears defense that has been one of the worst units in the NFL to begin the year.</p> <h4 id="omarion-hampton-rb">Omarion Hampton (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Harris suffered the non-contact injury with 5:12 remaining in the first half of Sunday’s win against the Broncos, and Hampton ended up getting most of the RB reps the rest of the way, finishing with 19 carries for 70 yards and one touchdown and six catches (on seven targets) for 59 yards. Hampton’s output as a receiver helped him set a new career high in yards from scrimmage, and the TD marked the initial end-zone visit of the rookie first-round pick’s career. Behind Hampton, Los Angeles has Hassan Haskins on the active roster and Kimani Vidal and Amar Johnson on the practice squad, meaning the team likely will add to the position group sooner than later. However, this is Hampton’s backfield for the foreseeable future.</p> <h4 id="ollie-gordon-ii-rb">Ollie Gordon II (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> The rookie sixth-round pick capped off the opening possession of the night with a two-yard touchdown run, his first NFL score. Gordon had logged only three total carries through the first two games, making his workload boost Thursday night particularly notable. Lead back De’Von Achane finished with just three more carries than Gordon, although the former was also targeted nine times. Given Gordon was productive with his opportunities against Buffalo, he could fill a solid complementary role once again in a Week 4 home matchup against the Jets on Monday night, Sept. 29.</p> <h4 id="russell-wilson-qb">Russell Wilson (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Wilson had a huge Week 2 against the Cowboys, throwing for 450 yards and three touchdowns, but he’s been abysmal outside of that contest. In his two other starts, Wilson has completed just 50.7 percent of his passes and averaged 4.8 yards per attempt with zero touchdowns. Wilson will serve as the Giants’ QB2 behind Dart against the Chargers, Mike Garafolo of NFL Network reports, as Jameis Winston will remain the third quarterback.</p> <h4 id="jaxson-dart-qb">Jaxson Dart (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> The writing was on the wall for this one after coach Brian Daboll on Monday refused to commit to Russell Wilson as his starter. Through three games, Wilson had completed a career-low 59.1 percent of his pass attempts for 778 yards, three touchdowns and three interceptions. All three of his touchdown passes came in Week 2 against the Cowboys, when Wilson threw for 450 yards. Outside of that game, Wilson completed just 35 of 69 passes (50.7 percent) for 328 yards (4.8 yards per attempt), zero scores and two INTs. The 0-3 Giants need a spark, and Dart will aim to provide one after he looked great during the preseason, completing 32 of 47 passes for 372 yards, three touchdowns and zero interceptions. He also rushed six times for 52 yards and a fourth score. Dart gets a tough test against the Chargers in Week 4, but his upside is immense as a dual-threat quarterback strapped with a legit No. 1 receiver in Malik Nabers, slot man Wan’Dale Robinson and deep threat Darius Slayton.</p> <h4 id="jonnu-smith-te">Jonnu Smith (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Smith was on the field for 83 percent of the Steelers’ offensive snaps Sunday. However, the team had a lackluster performance through the air, and the tight end wasn’t particularly productive. He also narrowly avoided disaster with the game tied in the fourth quarter, as he fumbled but the ball went out of bounds. Smith has led Pittsburgh’s tight ends in snaps over the first three weeks of the regular season, and he’s secured 12 of 13 targets for 65 yards and a touchdown compared to Pat Freiermuth’s 7-65-0 line on 10 targets.</p> <h4 id="chig-okonkwo-te">Chig Okonkwo (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Okonkwo paced the Titans in targets, receptions and yards and continues to show rapport with Cam Ward. His longest catch of the day came on the team’s opening possession, when he recorded a gain of 22 yards to set up a field goal. Okonkwo has four catches and six targets in each of his last two games, leading to a 12-120-0 line on 16 targets to begin the season.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_3_2025_TOM_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br><br></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_3_2025_TOM_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> </div> </article> <br> <hr> <br> <ul class="list-disc pl-8"></ul> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-6_links/">Week 6 Links</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-7_preview/">Week 7 Matchups Preview</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-6_Recap/">Week 6 League Recap</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-6-BTE/">Big Titi Energy Week 6 Report</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-6-TIB/">To Infinity and Bijan!
