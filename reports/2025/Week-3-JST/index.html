</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="michael-penix-jr-qb">Michael Penix Jr. (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Over his first five NFL starts, Penix hadn’t come close to scuffling in the manner he did Sunday, and the fact the opponent was a Panthers squad that had struggled on defense over the first two games made his poor effort all the more alarming. Penix threw multiple interceptions for the first time as a pro, and he was under 200 passing yards for the second straight game. While the low passing volume was by design in a dominant Week 2 win over the Vikings, Sunday’s downturn was directly correlated to how well the opposing defense stymied his efforts. Penix and the Falcons will welcome the Commanders for a Week 4 matchup next Sunday, a game that could pit the second-year signal caller against fellow 2024 first-rounder Jayden Daniels if the latter can play through his knee injury.</p> <h4 id="dandre-swift-rb">D’Andre Swift (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Swift was one of only a few poor performers for Chicago on Sunday. He was unable to find much running room throughout the game and was held below 50 rushing yards for the first time this season. Instead, Swift made his impact as a receiver, picking up 41 yards after a short dump-off midway through the second quarter. Swift remains the clear leader of the Bears’ backfield, as he out-touched Kyle Monangai 16-7 and has found the end zone in each of the last two contests.</p> <h4 id="rome-odunze-wr">Rome Odunze (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Odunze made an immediate impact, hauling in a 35-yard touchdown on Chicago’s first offensive possession. He was relatively quiet thereafter, though he still managed a pair of additional receptions for 13 and 14 yards. Odunze has found the end zone in every game this season while surpassing 60 yards in each of his last two contests.</p> <h4 id="caleb-williams-qb">Caleb Williams (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Williams has consistently looked sharp during the scripted portions of Chicago’s game plans to begin the season, which remained the case Sunday when he connected for a 35-yard touchdown with Rome Odunze on the opening drive. He carried his strong performance through the entire game, however, and matched his career high with four passing scores while also completing four passes of more than 30 yards. In addition to the explosiveness, Williams didn’t take a sack or turn the ball over in one of the most well-rounded showings of his young career.</p> <h4 id="jayden-reed-wr">Jayden Reed (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Injured Reserve <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Reed was already playing through a Jones fracture in his foot when he sustained a broken collarbone early during a Week 2 win against the Commanders. He’s since undergone surgeries for both health concerns and is facing a 6-to-8 week recovery timetable, meaning a move to IR was inevitable for Reed. For at least the next two games, the Packers’ receiving corps will be composed of Matthew Golden, Romeo Doubs, Dontayvion Wicks, Savion Williams and Malik Heath, while Christian Watson (knee) will be eligible for activation from the reserve/PUP list as soon as Week 6 following a Week 5 bye.</p> <h4 id="travis-kelce-te">Travis Kelce (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Kelce took a back seat to Kansas City’s starting trio of receivers on Sunday Night Football, all three of which finished with more yards than the star tight end. Backup tight end Noah Gray even got in on the action, finishing with a season high three catches in the win. Kelce would gladly trade a personal down game for the team’s first win, but fantasy managers have to feel underwhelmed with Sunday’s results. Kelce will look to be more involved in a potentially higher-scoring affair against the Ravens next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="hunter-henry-te">Hunter Henry (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> The veteran tight end’s connection with QB Drake Maye was just about the only thing working for the Patriots on the afternoon. No other New England player caught more than four passes (Mack Hollins) or had more than 38 receiving yards (Rhamondre Stevenson), and the backfield combined to lose an incredible four fumbles – two by Stevenson, and one each by Maye and Antonio Gibson. Henry will take 13-165-2 line on 22 targets through three games into a Week 4 meeting with a Panthers defense that has looked vulnerable to TEs so far.</p> <h4 id="chris-olave-wr">Chris Olave (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Olave wound up playing pitch-and-catch with QB Spencer Rattler in the blowout loss, resulting in a longest reception of nine yards despite the duo connecting on 10 passes Sunday. The 25-year-old Olave still produced strong results for those in PPR formats, but he remains scoreless through the Saints’ first three contests. The lack of touchdown potential limits Olave’s fantasy ceiling in standard formats heading into next Sunday’s tilt against the Bills.</p> <h4 id="will-shipley-rb">Will Shipley (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable</p> <h4 id="devonta-smith-wr">DeVonta Smith (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br> <strong>Details:</strong> The Eagles were forced into a more aggressive offensive game plan after they fell behind by three scores early in the fourth quarter. Smith and A.J. Brown both benefited, with the former chipping in as a reliable target closer to the line of scrimmage. Smith also provided the game-winning touchdown on a four-yard out with just under two minutes remaining in the game. Smith’s production will remain volatile, but he should have strong performances when the Eagles are forced to take to the air more often.</p> <h4 id="jalen-hurts-qb">Jalen Hurts (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Hurts hadn’t produced much as a passer through two weeks of the season, but the Eagles fell behind by 19 points early in the third quarter. He went on to record passing touchdowns of 33, nine and four yards in an impressive comeback effort while also completing three additional passes of 20 yards. Contrary to his passing performances, Hurts has consistently made an impact as a rusher through three games this season, and that also continued in the win, highlighted by a tush-push touchdown midway through the first quarter. It may not always be in the most conventional way, but Hurts continues to produce as an elite fantasy quarterback.</p> <h4 id="kaleb-johnson-rb">Kaleb Johnson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Johnson saw minimal snaps over the first two weeks of the regular season, but he was held out Sunday following last week’s error on special teams that led to a Seattle touchdown. Jaylen Warren continued to serve as the lead back against New England, playing 80 percent of the Steelers’ offensive snaps, while Kenneth Gainwell was on the field for 26 percent. The Steelers invested a third-round pick in Johnson, but the rookie has some work to do if he hopes to carve out a fantasy-relevant role.</p> <h4 id="dk-metcalf-wr">DK Metcalf (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br> <strong>Details:</strong> The veteran wideout continues to build chemistry with new quarterback Aaron Rodgers, bringing down a 12-yard jump ball early in the second quarter – a score that moved Rodgers past Brett Favre into fourth place on the NFL’s career passing TD list. Metcalf has found the end zone in back-to-back games, but he isn’t yet seeing the target volume as a Steeler that he was accustomed to in Seattle. He’ll take a 10-135-2 line on 17 targets into a Week 4 clash with the Vikings.</p> <h4 id="christian-mccaffrey-rb">Christian McCaffrey (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> McCaffrey continued to shoulder the load for a shorthanded 49ers offense that was without starters Brock Purdy (toe/shoulder), George Kittle (hamstring) and Jauan Jennings (ankle) in Week 3. CMC wound up handling a whopping 27 combined touches en route to his third 100-plus yard game in as many tries this season. Opposing defenses have been stacking the box against San Francisco in the two games Mac Jones has started, resulting in less running lanes for McCaffrey and a subpar average of 3.6 yards per carry. Fortunately for fantasy managers, the dual-threat superstar’s ability as a pass catcher (25-213-1) has helped offset his slow start on the ground. McCaffrey should check in as an elite RB1 for Week 4 when the 49ers host the Jaguars next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="rachaad-white-rb">Rachaad White (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> White was coming off a 10-carry, 65-yard, one-touchdown effort against the Texans, so his downturn Sunday, which came on his second-highest snap count of the season (20), was both noteworthy and disappointing. The fourth-year back was relegated to a much smaller role in the hard-fought win, and White has also been just a minor participant in the air attack through three games with a scant four targets. White and Bucs draw a tough matchup in Week 4, as the defending champion Eagles come to town on Sunday afternoon.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_3_2025_JST_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br><br></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_3_2025_JST_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> </div> </article> <br> <hr> <br> <ul class="list-disc pl-8"></ul> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-14_links/">Week 14 Links</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-15_preview/">Week 15 Matchups Preview</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-14_Recap/">Week 14 League Recap</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-14-TTC/">Third Time's the Charm?
