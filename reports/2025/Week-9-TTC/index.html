Dowdle has amassed 652 rushing yards and three TDs over the last five games, while adding a 10-112-1 line on 14 targets through the air, and he figures to see a heavy workload again in Week 10 against the Saints. </div> <h3 id="-bryce-young-qb">🟢 Bryce Young (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br> <strong>Details:</strong> The third-year QB returned from a one-game absence due to an ankle injury but failed to produce at least one touchdown, either through the air or on the ground, for the first time in 2025. Instead, the Panthers' offense leaned heavily on Rico Dowdle out of the backfield, leaving Young to be little more than a game manager. Young will take an 11:6 TD:INT through eight starts into what should be a more favorable matchup in Week 10 against the Saints. </div> <h3 id="-chase-brown-rb">🟢 Chase Brown (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> The wild back-and-forth nature of the game limited Brown's rushing opportunities against a vulnerable Bears run defense, but the third-year back made up for it with his work as a receiver. Brown's catch and target totals were both team and season highs, and he did manage to log double-digit carries for the third straight contest. Brown will face the Steelers' inconsistent run defense on the road when the Bengals return from their Week 10 bye on Sunday, Nov. 16. </div> <h3 id="-jerry-jeudy-wr">🟢 Jerry Jeudy (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br> <strong>Details:</strong> The veteran wideout continues to be an afterthought in the Browns' passing game, as tight ends David Njoku and Harold Fannin dominated the attention of rookie quarterback Dillon Gabriel. Jeudy has managed just a 9-75-0 line on 24 targets in Gabriel's four starts, and while the coaching staff might use a Week 9 bye to recalibrate the offense, Jeudy's fantasy appeal is at an all-time low. </div> <h3 id="-dak-prescott-qb">🟢 Dak Prescott (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Prescott took just two sacks against the Broncos in Week 8 but was pressured quite often in the loss, and the Cardinals then were much more successful getting home Monday night while racking up five sacks. The porous protection was particularly disappointing considering center Cooper Beebe returned from an ankle injury to anchor the Cowboys' offensive line, although Prescott was at least able to bounce back from the season-low-tying 188 yards he'd thrown for against Denver. The veteran signal-caller's one touchdown toss went to Ryan Flournoy from five yards out early in the fourth quarter, and Prescott's rushing yardage total qualified as a new season high. Prescott and his teammates will now have a Week 10 bye to regroup before returning to action with a Week 11 road matchup against the Raiders on Monday night, Nov. 17. </div> <h3 id="-ceedee-lamb-wr">🟢 CeeDee Lamb (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Lamb led the Cowboys across the board in receptions, receiving yards and targets while also contributing a team-high 33-yard reception. The overall numbers were certainly solid from a fantasy perspective, but they came in a disappointing home loss that dropped the Cowboys to two games under .500. Lamb has back-to-back seven-catch tallies and no fewer than 74 receiving yards in any non-injury-shortened game this season, and he'll draw a highly favorable matchup coming out of Dallas' Week 10 bye when the Cowboys face the Raiders on the road on Monday night, Nov. 17. </div> <h3 id="-rj-harvey-rb">🟢 RJ Harvey (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br> <strong>Details:</strong> The rookie actually led the Broncos in catches and receiving yards, setting new personal bests in those categories and capping his day with a 27-yard TD from Bo Nix early in the fourth quarter. Harvey has emerged as a big-play threat in Sean Payton's offense, getting into the end zone in three straight games and scoring five touchdowns in total -- two on the ground and three through the air -- despite seeing only 20 touches during that stretch. Harvey will look to keep making an impact as the No. 2 RB behind J.K. Dobbins in Week 10 against the Raiders. </div> <h3 id="-xavier-worthy-wr">🟢 Xavier Worthy (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Worthy tied Rashee Rice for the team lead in targets Sunday, but that's about where the good news ends. The 22-year-old Worthy couldn't turn those opportunities into production, finishing fourth in receiving despite garnering such a large share of targets. The speedy gadget receiver is still providing a decent floor for fantasy in his current role, but we haven't seen him explode for a notable performance yet. Perhaps Worthy can finally rip off a long score when the Chiefs return from the upcoming bye to face the Broncos in Week 11. </div> <h3 id="-patrick-mahomes-qb">🟢 Patrick Mahomes (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Mahomes picked a poor time to have his worst passing performance of the season after being outshined by rival Josh Allen (123.2 QB rating) in a loss that reshaped the landscape atop the AFC. It was Mahomes' first contest in 2025 in which he failed to register a touchdown, and also the first time he finished with a completion rate below 50 percent. Even with Sunday's dud, the 29-year-old heads into the upcoming bye week completing 65 percent of his passes for 2,349 passing yards and 21 total touchdowns through nine starts. Fantasy managers will have to search for a replacement signal-caller in Week 10 before Mahomes returns to action against Denver on Nov. 16. </div> <h3 id="-stefon-diggs-wr">🟢 Stefon Diggs (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Diggs scored an 11-yard touchdown in the second quarter on a diving effort to the pylon, but that was his only catch of the first half, during which fellow wide receiver Kayshon Boutte exited due to a hamstring injury. Despite Diggs' modest involvement, the veteran wide receiver finished third on the team in receiving yards behind DeMario Douglas (100) and Hunter Henry (51). After opening the season with a seven-game touchdown drought, Diggs will take a two-game scoring streak into a Week 10 road game against the Buccaneers. </div> <h3 id="-treveyon-henderson-rb">🟢 TreVeyon Henderson (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Henderson set a new career high in carries as the Patriots played without Rhamondre Stevenson (toe), and the rookie second-round pick's 55 rushing yards marked the second-highest total of Henderson's career behind his 75 against the Browns in Week 8. Terrell Jennings played a complementary role alongside Henderson, rushing 11 times for 35 yards and a touchdown. Henderson's production has been trending up, but he'll remain part of a platoon in Week 10 against the Buccaneers, whether he's splitting carries with Stevenson or Jennings. </div> <h3 id="-tyrone-tracy-jr-rb">🟢 Tyrone Tracy Jr. (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Tracy ceded the slight majority of work to Devin Singletary, who turned 10 touches into 51 scrimmage yards. Tracy worked ahead of Singletary for most of the former's rookie season in 2024, but the Giants may employ a more even split in 2025 following Cam Skattebo's season-ending ankle injury. The workload distribution between Tracy and Singletary will remain worth monitoring in Week 10 against the Bears. </div> <h3 id="-mason-taylor-te">🟢 Mason Taylor (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Taylor played through a quadriceps injury and led the Jets in targets. The first touchdown catch of his NFL career was a dramatic one, as running back Breece Hall found Taylor in the back of the end zone on a trick play for the game-winning score from four yards out just after the two-minute warning in the fourth quarter. The Jets could get some reinforcements at wide receiver if Garrett Wilson (knee) or Josh Reynolds (hip) can return after the team's Week 9 bye, but Taylor should remain involved as a pass catcher in the second half of his rookie campaign. </div> <h3 id="-brandon-aiyuk-wr">🔴 Brandon Aiyuk (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Out<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br> <strong>Details:</strong> The 49ers are continuing to evaluate Aiyuk on a week-to-week basis as he moves through the rehab process for the right knee surgery he required after suffering ACL and MCL tears in an Oct. 20, 2024 game. While the 49ers are seemingly still hopeful that Aiyuk will contribute at some point this season, a more definitive target date for his 2025 debut won't become clear until he starts practicing. </div> <h3 id="-bucky-irving-rb">🟡 Bucky Irving (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable </div> <h3 id="-tez-johnson-wr">🟢 Tez Johnson (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Johnson's catch and yardage totals were both team highs on an afternoon when Baker Mayfield threw for just 152 yards. The rookie's reception tally also qualified as a new career high, as Johnson benefited considerably from the absences of Mike Evans (IR, collarbone/concussion) and Chris Godwin (fibula). While Godwin is likely to get healthy over Tampa Bay's Week 9 bye, Evans will be out until late in the season in a best-case scenario, ensuring Johnson should continue enjoying an elevated role for the foreseeable future. </div> <hr> <h2 id="-lineup-analysis">📝 Lineup Analysis</h2> <h3 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h3> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false"
