</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="zay-flowers-wr">Zay Flowers (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Flowers was unsurprisingly Cooper Rush’s favorite target, and he came away with a decent fantasy stat line despite the blowout loss. He did most of his damage on a deep pass down the field that went for 56 yards, with Flowers being tackled at the four-yard line to narrowly miss out on his second score of the season. Though it was an unsustainable way to get the production, Flowers has now topped 70 receiving yards in four of five games this season and will hope to get Lamar Jackson (hamstring) back for a Week 6 matchup against the Rams.</p> <h4 id="derrick-henry-rb">Derrick Henry (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Henry predictably couldn’t find much rushing room with Cooper Rush under center, with his longest gain of the day going for seven yards. He managed to avoid complete disaster by scoring a one-yard touchdown late in the third quarter, but he’s now been held to 50 rushing yards or fewer in four of five games to begin the season. Henry’s outlook in Week 6 will be highly dependent on Lamar Jackson’s (hamstring) availability, but he has another tough matchup against the Rams.</p> <h4 id="josh-allen-qb">Josh Allen (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Allen had an up-and-down showing, with his biggest mistake coming on an interception late in the third quarter that allowed New England to build a 10-point lead. He still had plenty of excellent stretches in the game, including completing five passes of at least 20 yards while delivering touchdowns of six and two yards. As is typically the case, Allen chipped in extra production on the ground, with a 19-yard scramble helping him top 50 rushing yards for the second time on the campaign. While it wasn’t Allen’s most prolific showing, he continues to deliver a very safe fantasy floor.</p> <h4 id="sam-laporta-te">Sam LaPorta (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> LaPorta made a quick impact in Sunday’s blowout win, logging a 22-yard reception on the third play of the game before capping the drive with an athletic 10-yard catch and run that resulted in a touchdown. His longest gain of the day came early in the third quarter and went for 39 yards – nearly entirely after the catch. LaPorta entered Sunday’s contest having been held under 40 yards in three straight games, so his highest yardage total and first touchdown of the season came at a needed time.</p> <h4 id="amon-ra-st-brown-wr">Amon-Ra St. Brown (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br> <strong>Details:</strong> St. Brown continued his excellent start to the season, leading the Lions in all receiving stats. He saw the majority of his volume in the first half, but his longest catch of the day was a 26-yard grab early in the fourth quarter. The only shortcoming was that St. Brown failed to find the end zone for the first time since Week 1, but he balanced that out by recording his second 100-yard receiving game of the campaign.</p> <h4 id="tucker-kraft-te">Tucker Kraft (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Kraft was one of four Packers pass catchers to record at least 50 yards, and he finished third on the team in targets. His biggest impact came on Green Bay’s opening possession, when he recorded two receptions for 22 yards and was tackled just short of the goal line. Kraft has at least four targets in all four games this season and has at least 50 receiving yards or a touchdown in three of four contests.</p> <h4 id="jordan-love-qb">Jordan Love (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Love has been efficient all season, and that didn’t change Sunday night as he averaged 7.8 yards per attempt while completing four passes of more than 20 yards. The Packers were also pushed offensively by Dak Prescott and the Cowboys, with Love attempting at least 40 passes for only the sixth time in a regular-season contest in his career. Love targeted seven pass catchers at least three times, though he connected with Romeo Doubs for all three of his touchdowns and hit Matthew Golden for a 46-yard gain – his longest of the night. Love has had mediocre fantasy results to begin the season, but he has multiple touchdown passes in three of four contests while topping 250 passing yards twice.</p> <h4 id="kareem-hunt-rb">Kareem Hunt (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Three of Hunt’s seven carries came from five yards or closer to the opponent’s goal line, and he punched two of them in successfully to finish as the Chiefs’ top fantasy RB in Week 5. Co-starter Isiah Pacheco also received seven carries while seeing two more targets as a receiver, but the latter’s lack of use in the red zone proved to be the difference Monday. Hunt now is up to three touchdowns on the year, but he leaves much to be desired as a fantasy asset in games he is held out of the end zone. The 29-year-old checks in as a touchdown-dependent flex option against the Lions on Sunday Night Football in Week 6.</p> <h4 id="juju-smith-schuster-wr">JuJu Smith-Schuster (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> The veteran wideout’s workload is set to decline in a couple weeks when Rashee Rice returns from his six-game suspension, but Smith-Schuster continues to play a key role in the offense for KC in the meantime, as he led the wideout room with 57 offensive snaps (78 percent) in Week 4. Sunday’s effort marked the first time he’s reached double-digit PPR points this season, and he’ll likely remain a touchdown-dependent fantasy option while in a prominent role. That said, he has a decent matchup ahead versus the Jaguars in Week 5.</p> <h4 id="keenan-allen-wr">Keenan Allen (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Allen finished as the Chargers’ leading receiver in an overall forgettable offensive performance, resulting in middling fantasy numbers for managers Sunday. The veteran starter failed to hit pay dirt for the second week in a row after kicking off the campaign with a three-game scoring streak. Allen is still providing a solid fantasy floor by averaging 8.8 targets/game in his return to the Chargers, making him a safe option for next Sunday’s tilt against Miami.</p> <h4 id="blake-corum-rb">Blake Corum (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Corum’s six snaps on offense represents the first time this season he’s failed to crack the double-digit marker. Kyren Williams returned to fully dominating the timeshare, playing 62 snaps and garnering a total of 22 touches. Williams did have a costly fumble late in the fourth quarter and was stuffed on fourth-and-1 to end the game in overtime, but the momentum clearly seems to be shifting towards him reclaiming his monstrous usage of last season. A soft Baltimore defense leading the league in points allowed is up next in Week 6, but Corum’s steep decline in usage this week will make him difficult to trust in fantasy leagues.</p> <h4 id="kenneth-gainwell-rb">Kenneth Gainwell (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Jaylen Warren (knee) was surprisingly inactive Sunday morning, leaving Gainwell to fill in as Pittsburgh’s lead back. He did so admirably, scoring touchdowns from one and four yards away while also ripping off long gains of 15 and 10 yards. Gainwell also remained active as a pass catcher, giving him a well-rounded fantasy line. The Steelers are headed into their bye week, meaning this may be Gainwell’s only chance to handle this type of workload for the time being, but he proved plenty capable of handling the lead-back role if needed.</p> <h4 id="sterling-shepard-wr">Sterling Shepard (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Shepard overcame a minor foot injury early in the practice week in order to suit up without restrictions in Sunday’s win. The 32-year-old continued serving as the Buccaneers’ No. 3 receiver, occupying the vacancy left by Mike Evans (hamstring) in Weeks 4 and 5 after filling in for Chris Godwin over the team’s first three contests. If Evans remains sidelined for next Sunday’s tilt against the 49ers, Shepard can continue providing value in Week 6 for those in deeper formats.</p> <h4 id="cam-ward-qb">Cam Ward (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Ward had an abysmal performance for nearly the entire game, as he went only 5-for-16 for 58 yards through two quarters. He also threw an interception late in the fourth quarter that seemingly put an end to any comeback attempt for the Titans, only to have Dadrion Taylor-Demerson fumble the ball into the end zone for a touchdown for Tennessee. It wasn’t all bad news for Ward, as he connected on deep passes of 47 and 38 yards with Calvin Ridley as key parts of the Titans’ rally – his longest completions as a pro. While it’s positive that Ward was able to earn his first win in the NFL, his performance still left plenty to be desired, and he has at least one turnover in all five of his career starts.</p> <h4 id="jacory-croskey-merritt-rb">Jacory Croskey-Merritt (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Croskey-Merritt finally broke out of the backfield committee that was holding him back in fantasy with a dominating two-touchdown performance against the Chargers. The seventh-round rookie commanded 14 of Washington’s 20 running-back carries Sunday, eclipsing a personal high of 10 set back in his initial breakout game in Week 1. One would assume that the 150-yard, multi-score showing should cement the starting job for the Arizona product moving forward. A preseason darling heading into drafts, Croskey-Merritt’s managers can officially fire up the hype train heading into a soft matchup against the Bears next Monday.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current
