</code></pre> <hr> <h2 id="-player-report">🏥 Player Report</h2> <h3 id="-jacoby-brissett-qb">🟢 Jacoby Brissett (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> During Murray's current seven-game absence as he tends to a mid-foot sprain, Brissett has eclipsed 300 yards passing four times and tossed exactly two touchdowns on six occasions. Overall, Brissett has completed 67.8 percent of his passes (204 of 301) for 2,188 yards with a 13:4 TD:INT while adding 26 carries for 114 yards and another score during that span. In Week 14, he'll be taking on a Rams defense that has surrendered the seventh-fewest yards per attempt (6.5) to opposing quarterbacks this season, so the sledding may be a bit tougher for Brissett this time around. </div> <h3 id="-marvin-harrison-jr-wr">🟡 Marvin Harrison Jr. (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Back in action Sunday after missing the previous two contests while recovering from an appendectomy, Harrison finished with six catches for 69 yards on seven targets while playing 37 of 61 offensive snaps (61 percent). It's not clear when Harrison sustained the heel injury, but he had an insert placed in his shoe at one point during the contest, only to remove it later on. Harrison was then seen limping around on the field in the second half after catching a pass, prompting the Cardinals to pull him from the contest. The second-year wideout will undergo further evaluation, so his status for next Sunday's matchup with the Rams is cloudy for the time being. </div> <h3 id="-james-cook-iii-rb">🟢 James Cook III (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Cook set new season highs in carries and touches while gashing the Steelers' defense for 177 yards on the road. Buffalo's workhorse also finished as the team's leading receiver while accounting for 48 percent of the offense's net yards Sunday. The only blemish on yet another dominant rushing performance was a pair of fumbles, only one of which was scooped up by the defense. Cook had coughed up just one fumble over his previous 11 contests, which looks minuscule standing next to the nine touchdowns and 1,464 yards from scrimmage the fantasy stud has provided managers this season. A tasty matchup against the Bengals' defense awaits Cook and the Bills in Week 14. </div> <h3 id="-dalton-kincaid-te">🟢 Dalton Kincaid (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Out<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> After being deemed a 'DNP' on Wednesday, Kincaid, who last saw game action in Week 10, practiced in a limited fashion both Thursday and Friday before being listed as questionable to face Pittsburgh. In his continued absence, Dawson Knox and Jackson Hawes will handle the Bills' Week 13 tight-end duties, a context that resulted in Knox catching three of his four targets for 17 yards and Hawes hauling in both of his targets in the team's 23-19 loss to the Texans on Nov. 20. </div> <h3 id="-jared-goff-qb">🟢 Jared Goff (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Top target Amon-Ra St. Brown (ankle) left the game in the first quarter and didn't return, forcing Goff to adjust on the fly. While the QB leaned heavily on Jameson Williams (7-144-1 on 10 targets) and also found rookie Isaac TeSlaa for a third-quarter score, St. Brown's absence was noticeable as the Lions tried to mount a fourth-quarter comeback. Goff still tossed multiple touchdowns for the fourth time in five games since Detroit's Week 8 bye, posting a 10:2 TD:INT over that stretch. Whether St. Brown is able to suit up or not, Goff could be more productive against a less stingy defense in Week 14 against the Cowboys. </div> <h3 id="-jayden-higgins-wr">🟢 Jayden Higgins (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Higgins tied for second on the Texans with Nico Collins in receptions while also checking in as the runner-up to his teammate in receiving yards on the afternoon. The rookie had flashed plenty of chemistry with fill-in quarterback Davis Mills over the previous three games -- Higgins posted a 13-135-2 line over that span -- so it was particularly encouraging for fantasy managers to see Higgins establish a new single-game career-high yardage total with C.J. Stroud back under center. Higgins should remain an essential part of the air attack in a Week 14 road showdown against the Chiefs next Sunday night. </div> <h3 id="-tyler-warren-te">🟢 Tyler Warren (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Warren, who was dealing with an illness that led to him being added to the injury report Saturday, matched his season low in targets and was also limited to his lowest yardage total of the campaign. His longest catch of the day came on a 12-yard touchdown grab late in the third quarter, his fifth score of the campaign and first since Week 7. After a hot start to the season, Warren has been held to 50 or fewer receiving yards in three of his last four games. </div> <h3 id="-ashton-jeanty-rb">🟢 Ashton Jeanty (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Jeanty continues to get minimal help from the 2-10 Raiders' overmatched offensive line. The rookie sixth overall pick is averaging 18.7 touches per game but just 3.5 yards per carry heading into a Week 14 home game against the tough Broncos defense. Other Raiders running backs combined for one carry and no targets against the Chargers, so Jeanty remains the unquestioned top option in the backfield for Vegas. </div> <h3 id="-omarion-hampton-rb">🔴 Omarion Hampton (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Injured Reserve<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Hampton, whose 21-day practice window was opened Tuesday, was limited at practice this week, but he won't be activated from IR ahead of Week 13 action and thus will target a potential return to the lineup Monday, Dec. 8 against the Eagles. In Hampton's continued absence, Kimani Vidal once again is in line to pace the Chargers backfield this weekend, with Trayveon Williams, Jaret Patterson and Amar Johnson all options to come up from the practice squad. Per Kris Rhim of ESPN.com, Hampton revealed Wednesday that he is bouncing back from a left ankle fracture that he sustained Week 5, and the running back was sporting a yellow (non-contact) jersey in practice Friday, per Rhim. Meanwhile, Adam Schefter of ESPN reports that coach Jim Harbaugh told reporters that "it was a good week" for Hampton, "really beneficial, ramping up. Everything's on track to return, (but) not this week." </div> <h3 id="-blake-corum-rb">🟢 Blake Corum (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> His TD came on a two-yard plunge right before halftime after Kyren Williams left the game to get his ankle checked out. Williams was back in the lineup to begin the second half and wound up with 72 rushing yards and a score of his own, and after the contest he indicated that he's not concerned about the ankle being a lingering issue. Even so, the Rams had already been increasing Corum's workload in recent weeks, so Williams' ankle might give them an excuse to move the backfield toward more of a 50-50 split in Week 14 against the Cardinals. Corum's 81 rushing yards were a season high, while his trip to the end zone was his first since Week 2. </div> <h3 id="-kayshon-boutte-wr">🟢 Kayshon Boutte (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Boutte tied Hunter Henry for the team lead in receptions and brought in one of Drake Maye's two touchdown passes, recording a three-yard scoring grab with one minute remaining in the first quarter. Five of Boutte's six touchdowns on the campaign have come within the last six contests, although he's only totaled 50 receiving yards in the last three games. Boutte next takes aim at the Bills' talented secondary in a Week 15 home clash on Sunday, Dec. 14 following a Week 14 bye. </div> <h3 id="-jaxson-dart-qb">🟢 Jaxson Dart (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Dart returned from a two-game absence after clearing the league's concussion protocol in order to reclaim his starting gig ahead of Monday's primetime tilt. The rookie signal-caller was understandably conservative from the pocket -- after already being checked for a possible concussion four times since the preseason -- finishing with the second-lowest passing yardage total through eight starts. The Ole Miss product also recorded his lowest carry total while failing to extend his rushing touchdown streak to six games. Dart has been a fantasy revelation in his first year as a pro, generating 1,893 yards from scrimmage with 18 touchdowns to five turnovers heading into the Giants' Week 14 bye. The dual-threat quarterback will look to build confidence in a favorable home matchup against the Commanders when play resumes on Sunday, Dec. 14. </div> <h3 id="-aj-barner-te">🟢 AJ Barner (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Barner finished Sunday's contest as Seattle's leading receiver with the team executing a run-heavy game plan against Minnesota. The versatile tight end ran another successful variation of Philadelphia's "tush push," marking his ninth rushing attempt of the season. Barner has been a pleasant surprise for those in deeper fantasy formats with 37 receptions for 359 yards and five total touchdowns across 12 starts. </div> <h3 id="-tez-johnson-wr">🟢 Tez Johnson (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Johnson was an afterthought on offense against Arizona, garnering his fewest looks since Week 4. The wide receiver has now posted two one-catch performances over the last three contests. In the last four weeks, he's caught nine of 14 targets for 74 yards, but his fantasy value has been boosted by three scores. Johnson will look to get back into the end zone against New Orleans in Week 14. </div> <h3 id="-chimere-dike-wr">🟢 Chimere Dike (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Dike's inconsistency this season has mirrored that of the Tennessee offense as a whole, as he has at least 40 receiving yards in three of his last six games and under 20 in the remaining three. While his receiving line was a disappointment, Dike has gained a more consistent role in the offense, commanding at least four targets in four of his last six games.

Rodriguez didn't have a particularly efficient showing, though he did find the end zone from eight yards away shortly before halftime to account for his fourth touchdown in his last six matchups. He now has double-digit rushing attempts in three of his last four matchups heading into a Week 14 contest against the Vikings. </div> <hr> <h2 id="-lineup-analysis">📝 Lineup Analysis</h2> <h3 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h3> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_13_2025_TOM_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br></p> <h3 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h3> <p><small><em>What you should have started for maximum points</em></small></p> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_13_2025_TOM_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br></p> <hr> <h2 id="-week-14-optimal-projected-lineup">🔮 Week 14 Optimal Projected Lineup</h2> <div style="padding: 15px; background-color: #e7f3ff; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;"> <strong>Next Opponent:</strong> Game of Zones - House Hamlin<br> <strong>Total Projected Points:</strong> 124.41<br> </div> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_14_2025_TOM_projected.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> <th data-field="opponent" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="false">Opponent</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <hr> <h2 id="-remaining-schedule-analysis">📅 Remaining Schedule Analysis</h2> <div style="padding: 15px; background-color: #fff3cd; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;"> <strong>⚠️ Average Opponent Strength:</strong> 118.51 PPG </div> <table class="table table-sm table-hover"> <thead><tr> <th>Opponent</th> <th>Record</th> <th>Avg Points</th> </tr></thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Game of Zones - House Hamlin</strong></td> <td>8-5</td> <td>118.51</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> </article> <br> <hr> <br> <ul class="list-disc pl-8"></ul> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-14_links/">Week 14 Links</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-15_preview/">Week 15 Matchups Preview</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-14_Recap/">Week 14 League Recap</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-14-TTC/">Third Time's the Charm?
