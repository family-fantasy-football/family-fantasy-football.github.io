</code></pre> <hr> <h2 id="-player-report">🏥 Player Report</h2> <h3 id="-bijan-robinson-rb">🟢 Bijan Robinson (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Robinson came into the matchup against a Dolphins defense that had been an absolute sieve against the run all season with sky-high expectations, making his dud of a fantasy performance all the more alarming. The star back could never get going on the ground, and his game-long 17-yard reception in the first half served as the highlight of an otherwise forgettable afternoon. Robinson's early third-quarter fumble was also costly, as it came on the Dolphins' 10-yard line with Atlanta trying to address a 17-3 deficit at the time. Following this season-worst performance, Robinson seemingly has nowhere to go but up in a Week 9 road matchup against the Patriots next Sunday afternoon. </div> <h3 id="-xavier-legette-wr">🟢 Xavier Legette (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br> <strong>Details:</strong> One week after posting a career-best 9-92-1 line against the Jets, Legette saw a significant downturn in the lopsided loss. The second-year wideout's Week 7 breakout is more or less an outlier, considering Legette has topped out at three receptions and 31 receiving yards otherwise in terms of single-game highs. Legette will take a middling 19-159-2 line on 34 targets over six games into a Week 9 road trip to Green Bay. </div> <h3 id="-colston-loveland-te">🟢 Colston Loveland (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> The rookie tight end got the start in place of Cole Kmet (back), and it looked like Loveland might be headed for a breakout performance after he caught Caleb Williams' first pass of the afternoon for an 18-yard gain. Loveland and the Bears' offense both struggled to gain consistent yards after that, however. Kmet had never missed a regular-season game in his career before Sunday and isn't expected to go on injured reserve, but even if he sits out a Week 9 tilt against the Bengals, Loveland will still be tough to rely on. </div> <h3 id="-dylan-sampson-rb">🟢 Dylan Sampson (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br> <strong>Details:</strong> The eight touches on offense were Sampson's biggest volume since Week 1, before fellow rookie RB Quinshon Judkins had made his NFL debut. Sunday's increase also came in part due to the absence of Judkins, who left the game in the third quarter with a shoulder injury. Sampson's biggest contributions so far have come as a receiver, and through eight games he's managed just 51 rushing yards and 1.8 yards per carry, but a 20-133-1 line on 23 targets. The Browns are on bye in Week 9, so Judkins may not miss any further time, but if he isn't ready to return, Sampson could be the lead back -- with Jerome Ford in support -- in Week 10 against the Jets. </div> <h3 id="-jaydon-blue-rb">🟢 Jaydon Blue (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br> <strong>Details:</strong> About half of the rookie's yardage came on one 14-yard run, which was the longest of the day by any Cowboy. Blue remains firmly behind Javonte Williams in the pecking order for touches, but he's beginning to see enough work to flash occasional glimpses of his upside. Over the last two games -- one blowout win and one blowout loss -- he's compiled 58 rushing yards on 15 carries, while catching his only target for five yards. </div> <h3 id="-bo-nix-qb">🟢 Bo Nix (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Nix has produced four scores for fantasy managers in consecutive appearances, using his arm for all four trips to the end zone against a depleted Dallas secondary this time around. The sophomore signal-caller leaned on his younger receiving options Sunday, dialing up second-year wideout Troy Franklin in the end zone twice and rookies Pat Bryant and RJ Harvey once each. Nix is proving his standout rookie campaign was no fluke, checking in with 1,803 passing yards and 15 touchdowns to five interceptions near the midpoint of the regular season. The 25-year-old will look to keep his hot streak alive against Houston's stingy defense next Sunday. </div> <h3 id="-kalif-raymond-wr">🟢 Kalif Raymond (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Raymond was able to secure his first catches since Week 4, playing 42 percent of the team's offensive snaps in Week 7. The wide receiver still appears to have the edge on Isaac TeSlaa for the No. 3 spot on the depth chart, logging 18 more offensive snaps than the rookie in the contest. Raymond has caught nine of 12 targets for 64 yards over seven games this season. </div> <h3 id="-geno-smith-qb">🟢 Geno Smith (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> The futility of the Raiders offense can be stated in many different ways, and Smith was at the center of the lack of production. The unit ran only two offensive plays in Chiefs territory, totaled only three first downs, and ran only 30 offensive plays, the final of which was the second-fewest in the Super Bowl era, per Josh Dubow of The Associated Press. Needless to say, it was a disastrous fantasy performance, and Smith has now thrown for less than 200 yards in four of his seven starts and has zero scores in three contests. He was also replaced by Kenny Pickett late in the game due to the score, but there is no indication that the team is considering a change at quarterback. </div> <h3 id="-puka-nacua-wr">🟡 Puka Nacua (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Nacua appears on track to resume practicing for the first time since suffering a low left-ankle sprain Week 6 against the Ravens, lending optimism to the notion that he'll retake the field Sunday versus the Saints. Los Angeles is fresh off a Week 8 bye, which provided a crucial period for Nacua to rest up. While Nacua's status for Week 9 won't be made official until the team has had a chance to thoroughly monitor him in practice, the third-year wideout will be a must-start fantasy option as soon as he's cleared for game action, and Adam Schefter of ESPN reports that he's expected to suit up against New Orleans. </div> <h3 id="-kyren-williams-rb">🟢 Kyren Williams (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Williams' managers suffered a casual stat line in Sunday's one-sided affair after the Rams' passing attack accounted for all five of the team's trips to the end zone in London. The veteran starter's even carry split with Blake Corum (12-37-0) can also be attributed to an unfavorable game script, with six of the backup's carries essentially coming in garbage time. Williams has been a reliable starter in fantasy in 2025, generating 638 yards from scrimmage and five total touchdowns through seven starts. A lack of scoring is the only thing holding the 24-year-old back from his first-round projections, as he is currently on pace to score 12 touchdowns after averaging 15.5 over his last two standout seasons. Williams will be looking to hit pay dirt when the Rams come out of the bye to face the Saints in Week 9. </div> <h3 id="-tank-bigsby-rb">🟢 Tank Bigsby (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Saquon Barkley left early in the fourth quarter with a groin injury, and Bigsby did most of his damage as the Eagles put the game to bed. It was still a very impressive performance from the former Jaguar, who came into the afternoon with just 23 rushing yards on the season between Jacksonville and Philly while being primarily used as a kickoff returner. The Eagles get a well-timed Week 9 bye, so Barkley may not miss any further action, but if he's not ready to return for a Week 10 clash with the Packers, Bigsby could find himself handling a very significant role in the offense. </div> <h3 id="-cade-otton-te">🟢 Cade Otton (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Otton finished second in receiving production for the Buccaneers on a low-volume passing day. After a slow start to the campaign, the veteran tight end has picked things up with averages of 5.0 receptions and 59.3 yards over his last four appearances. Otton should continue seeing elevated usage out of Tampa Bay's upcoming bye week for a team dealing with multiple injuries at the receiver position. </div> <h3 id="-emeka-egbuka-wr">🟢 Emeka Egbuka (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Egbuka did not carry an injury designation in Week 8, but the final results suggest that he is still isn't playing at 100 percent. The talented rookie finished with a catch rate below 50 percent for the second week in a row, the only two times he has fallen below that mark this season. Fortunately for fantasy managers, Egbuka will get an extra week of recovery for his nagging hamstring with Tampa Bay on bye in Week 9. A refreshed Egbuka will look to get back on track when the Buccaneers host the Patriots on Nov. 9. </div> <h3 id="-calvin-ridley-wr">🟡 Calvin Ridley (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable </div> <h3 id="-deebo-samuel-wr">🟢 Deebo Samuel (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Samuel's return from a one-game absence did next to nothing to boost the offense, one that was led by QB Marcus Mariota due to Jayden Daniels' (hamstring) absence. The veteran wideout tied a season low in receiving yards, and he has an anemic 7-26-0 line on 11 targets over his last two appearances overall. Samuel could be a primary beneficiary if Daniels is able to return for Sunday night's Week 9 matchup against the Seahawks. </div> <hr> <h2 id="-lineup-analysis">📝 Lineup Analysis</h2> <h3 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h3> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_8_2025_ARV_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br></p> <h3 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h3> <p><small><em>What you should have started for maximum points</em></small></p> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_8_2025_ARV_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br></p> <hr> <h2 id="-week-9-optimal-projected-lineup">🔮 Week 9 Optimal Projected Lineup</h2> <div style="padding: 15px; background-color: #e7f3ff; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;"> <strong>Next Opponent:</strong> 90s MonCon<br> <strong>Total Projected Points:</strong> 112.24<br> </div> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_9_2025_ARV_projected.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> <th data-field="opponent" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="false">Opponent</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <hr> <h2 id="-remaining-schedule-analysis">📅 Remaining Schedule Analysis</h2> <div style="padding: 15px; background-color: #fff3cd; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;"> <strong>⚠️ Average Opponent Strength:</strong> 112.15 PPG </div> <table class="table table-sm table-hover"> <thead><tr> <th>Opponent</th> <th>Record</th> <th>Avg Points</th> </tr></thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>90s MonCon</strong></td> <td>3-5</td> <td>128.07</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Mama Daughter Duo</strong></td> <td>4-4</td> <td>135.07</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Big Titi Energy</strong></td> <td>2-6</td> <td>100.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Emma's Excellent Team</strong></td> <td>1-7</td> <td>84.69</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Game of Zones - House Hamlin</strong></td> <td>5-3</td> <td>125.06</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Big Titi Energy</strong></td> <td>2-6</td> <td>100.00</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> </article> <br> <hr> <br> <ul class="list-disc pl-8"></ul> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-8_links/">Week 8 Links</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-9_preview/">Week 9 Matchups Preview</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-8_Recap/">Week 8 League Recap</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-8-EET/">Emma's Excellent Team Week 8 Report</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-8-TIB/">To Infinity and Bijan!
