</code></pre> <hr> <h2 id="-player-report">🏥 Player Report</h2> <h3 id="-khalil-shakir-wr">🟢 Khalil Shakir (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Shakir led the Bills in receptions, receiving yards and targets on a forgettable day for Buffalo's offense despite Josh Allen throwing for over 300 yards. Shakir posted a second consecutive seven-catch effort, and he's recorded at least six receptions in four of the last five contests overall, albeit while not topping 88 receiving yards at any point in that span. Shakir takes a 45-457-3 receiving line on 58 targets into a Week 11 home matchup against the Buccaneers. </div> <h3 id="-harold-fannin-jr-te">🟢 Harold Fannin Jr. (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Fannin hurt his hamstring Thursday but played through the injury and finished second on the team in targets, catches and receiving yards behind Jerry Jeudy. Fellow Browns tight end David Njoku scored his third touchdown of the season, while Fannin remains stuck on two touchdowns heading into a Week 11 home game against the Ravens. Fannin leads the team with 42 catches and 396 receiving yards, as the rookie third-round pick has been one of the few bright spots for the 2-7 Browns. </div> <h3 id="-jake-ferguson-te">🟢 Jake Ferguson (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Following a rare Week 8 blanking against the Broncos, Ferguson bounced back Monday night to finish third across the board in receptions, receiving yards and targets for the Cowboys. The talented tight end did lose a fumble deep in Cardinals territory just past the halfway point of the second quarter, however, and although the turnover didn't directly lead to any points for Arizona, it certainly robbed Dallas of a scoring opportunity. Ferguson has at least five receptions in all but two games and a career-high six touchdown catches heading into the Week 10 bye, but he's also averaging a career-low 6.9 yards per grab. </div> <h3 id="-george-pickens-wr">🟢 George Pickens (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Pickens had a shaky night in terms of ball security, but he made up for it by recovering one of his fumbles and also finishing second across the board to CeeDee Lamb in receptions, receiving yards and targets. Pickens has proven an excellent fit in the Cowboys' air attack over the first half of his debut campaign in Dallas, as he'll head into the Week 10 bye with four straight tallies of 78 receiving yards or more and a 49-764-6 receiving line overall. </div> <h3 id="-jahmyr-gibbs-rb">🟢 Jahmyr Gibbs (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Gibbs showcased his entire skill set in Sunday's win, accounting for three touchdowns and 172 yards from scrimmage. His first score came on a route over the middle for 14 yards, which he then followed up with a tough 13-yard run into the end zone, during which he bullied his way through several defenders. Gibbs capped off his day with a 43-yard scamper down the right sideline, beating several Commanders defenders with his speed. This was Gibbs' most productive fantasy performance of the season -- it was his second-highest yardage total of the campaign -- and marked his fourth game with either multiple trips to the end zone or 100 total yards from scrimmage. </div> <h3 id="-woody-marks-rb">🟢 Woody Marks (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br> <strong>Details:</strong> The rookie RB led the Texans' backfield with 16 touches (to Nick Chubb's six) and 81 scrimmage yards to the veteran's 52, and Marks capped his strong performance with a one-yard TD plunge in the second quarter. He's seen double-digit carries in four straight games as he continues to push his way to the top of the depth chart, and Marks could deliver another big performance in Week 11 against the Titans -- a defense he erupted for 119 combined yards and two touchdowns against in Week 4. </div> <h3 id="-michael-pittman-jr-wr">🟢 Michael Pittman Jr. (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Tyler Warren and Alec Pierce served as Daniel Jones' top two targets Sunday, leaving Pittman in an unfamiliar tertiary role. The veteran's yardage total was a season-low figure, as was his target tally, but the quiet performance can very comfortably be labeled an outlier considering Pittman's typical body of work. Pittman should be in line for a much busier afternoon in a Week 12 road showdown against the Chiefs following a Week 11 bye. </div> <h3 id="-daniel-jones-qb">🟢 Daniel Jones (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Jones turned in one of the efficient efforts he's regularly managed in Shane Steichen's quarterback-friendly system, but ball security was a significant issue against an aggressive Falcons defense that sacked him seven times. Nevertheless, Jones persevered with the help of Jonathan Taylor's 244-yard, three-touchdown effort on the ground, while the veteran quarterback focused heavily on Tyler Warren and Alec Pierce when dropping back, and the latter was on the receiving end of Jones' one scoring toss from 37 yards out in the first quarter. Jones' one lost fumble, which came early in the third quarter, didn't lead to any Falcons points, and he'll head into the Week 11 bye ahead of a Week 12 road showdown against the Chiefs with 2,659 passing yards, 143 rushing yards and 20 total touchdowns. </div> <h3 id="-bhayshul-tuten-rb">🟢 Bhayshul Tuten (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> A week after tying his season high with 10 offensive touches and scoring his third touchdown of the season, Tuten worked as more of a true backup Sunday while setting a season low with just 10 yards from scrimmage. Starter Travis Etienne again dominated the backfield work with 18 touches, leaving Tuten locked into a secondary role. </div> <h3 id="-justin-herbert-qb">🟢 Justin Herbert (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Herbert posted a traditional "game manager" type stat line, taking good care of the football while doing just enough to lift his team to victory. The loss of LT Joe Alt (ankle) to injured reserve was on full display as the Chargers' signal-caller was sacked five times on Sunday Night Football. Herbert suffered an injury on one of the first-half sacks, but he was able to stay in the game after having his ankle taped up, according to ESPN's Kris Rhim. The 27-year-old showed no mobility limitations in the second half, which should help put his fantasy managers' thoughts at ease moving forward. Herbert will benefit from facing the Jaguars' 28th-ranked pass defense next Sunday in the Chargers' last game preceding the team's Week 12 bye. </div> <h3 id="-davante-adams-wr">🟡 Davante Adams (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Adams' status will bear monitoring ahead of Week 11 against the Seahawks, but McVay sounded optimistic regarding Adams' injury after the game. Prior to exiting in the fourth quarter, Adams caught six of eight targets for 77 yards and scored his ninth touchdown of the season. </div> <h3 id="-tj-hockenson-te">🟢 T.J. Hockenson (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Hockenson hasn't had much action with J.J. McCarthy at quarterback as he's had just 12 targets in his four games behind center. He's not blocking more with Josh Oliver sidelined (foot) as he went out on a route on 44 of his 58 snaps on offense, so there's some hope for an increase in receptions. </div> <h3 id="-alvin-kamara-rb">🟢 Alvin Kamara (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> The veteran RB topped 100 scrimmage yards for the first time since Week 2, snapping a string of five straight games in which he didn't even reach 40 rushing yards. Kamara is still looking for his first TD since Week 1, but it was still an encouraging sign, as was the fact that rookie quarterback Tyler Shough got the passing game going. Kamara will get a breather during next week's bye before taking on the Falcons in Week 12. </div> <h3 id="-ricky-pearsall-wr">🟡 Ricky Pearsall (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Pearsall hasn't practiced since initially suffering a PCL injury in his right knee Week 4, but he has worked out on the side on multiple occasions in recent weeks. Shanahan told Nick Wagoner of ESPN.com that "hopefully the next two days go good, and if they do, he'll be back out there. ... He had a good weekend." Wednesday's injury report not only will reveal if Pearsall was able to mix back into drills, but if No. 1 QB Brock Purdy (toe) has put himself in a position for his own first game action since Week 4. </div> <hr> <h2 id="-lineup-analysis">📝 Lineup Analysis</h2> <h3 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h3> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_10_2025_MMT_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br></p> <h3 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h3> <p><small><em>What you should have started for maximum points</em></small></p> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_10_2025_MMT_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br></p> <hr> <h2 id="-week-11-optimal-projected-lineup">🔮 Week 11 Optimal Projected Lineup</h2> <div style="padding: 15px; background-color: #e7f3ff; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;"> <strong>Next Opponent:</strong> Third Time's the Charm?<br> <strong>Total Projected Points:</strong> 133.64<br> </div> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_11_2025_MMT_projected.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> <th data-field="opponent" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="false">Opponent</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <hr> <h2 id="-remaining-schedule-analysis">📅 Remaining Schedule Analysis</h2> <div style="padding: 15px; background-color: #fff3cd; border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 15px;"> <strong>🔥 Average Opponent Strength:</strong> 123.80 PPG </div> <table class="table table-sm table-hover"> <thead><tr> <th>Opponent</th> <th>Record</th> <th>Avg Points</th> </tr></thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Third Time's the Charm?</strong></td> <td>7-3</td> <td>124.17</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>90s MonCon</strong></td> <td>4-6</td> <td>131.07</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Mama Daughter Duo</strong></td> <td>6-4</td> <td>131.65</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Mcconky Donkeys</strong></td> <td>5-5</td> <td>108.33</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> </article> <br> <hr> <br> <ul class="list-disc pl-8"></ul> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-13_links/">Week 13 Links</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-14_preview/">Week 14 Matchups Preview</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-13_Recap/">Week 13 League Recap</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-13-EET/">Emma's Excellent Team Week 13 Report</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-13-TIB/">To Infinity and Bijan!
