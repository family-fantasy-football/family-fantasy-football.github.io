</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="lamar-jackson-qb">Lamar Jackson (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Jackson was nearly flawless commanding the Ravens’ offense on Sunday Night Football, but it wasn’t enough to lift his team over the Bills in an instant classic. The 28-year-old was able to help fantasy managers with his three combined touchdowns, a mark he reached an impressive nine times in 2024. Those who spent a premium pick on the dual-threat superstar have to be feeling good about their QB heading into the Ravens’ home opener against the Browns next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="joe-flacco-qb">Joe Flacco (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> The Browns played at a methodical pace and prioritized passes to the short areas of the field early in the game, with Flacco attempting 15 passes for 87 yards by halftime. He opened things up in the second half, when he accounted for his longest completions of the game (25, 25 and 22 yards). Flacco’s lone touchdown of the game came on the opening drive of the third quarter, when he connected with Cedric Tillman from five yards away. Things turned quickly, however, as he threw an interception that set up the game-winning field goal for Cincinnati on the following drive.</p> <h4 id="quinshon-judkins-rb">Quinshon Judkins (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Out <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Judkins finally put pen to paper on his rookie contract with the Browns on Saturday, but because he missed all of training camp and preseason while he was unsigned following his July 12 arrest in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. on charges of domestic assault and battery, Cleveland was granted a two-game exemption in which the running back won’t count toward the 53-man roster. Though all charges against Judkins have since been dropped, the NFL is still investigating the alleged incident, and the 21-year-old is scheduled to meet with league officials during the upcoming week. While it’s still unclear if Judkins will be subject to any league discipline, the expectation is that he’ll have the roster exemption lifted in advance of the Week 2 contest. Because of all the time he’s missed this summer, Judkins could handle a light role initially for Cleveland, though Cameron Wolfe of NFL Network relays that the Browns are hopeful that Judkins will eventually emerge as the team’s lead back. Dylan Sampson and Jerome Ford will take on the brunt of the snaps and touches out of the backfield for at least the Week 1 game, however.</p> <h4 id="marvin-mims-jr-wr">Marvin Mims Jr. (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Mims was able to suit up after practicing all week while recovering from a thigh injury. Managers may have hoped he sat this one out after a lost fumble resulted in a negative fantasy score in standard formats. Courtland Sutton (6-61-1) and Troy Franklin (4-44-0) finished with more targets and better production than Mims. The 23-year-old Mims will have to step it up, starting with next Sunday’s matchup against the Colts, or run the risk of falling down the receiver depth chart.</p> <h4 id="jameson-williams-wr">Jameson Williams (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Williams’ primary appeal as a fantasy contributor is his ability to hit for explosive plays, but the Packers held him under wraps in Week 1. His longest reception went for just 11 yards, and he was held to his lowest yardage total in a regular-season game since Week 7 of the 2024 campaign. The entire Lions’ offense was ineffective, so it’s not time to panic on Williams heading into a Week 2 matchup against the Bears.</p> <h4 id="nico-collins-wr">Nico Collins (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Houston’s entire aerial attack sputtered out of the gates, failing to produce any touchdowns or a receiver with more than 32 yards. Collins’ receiving line marks the wideout’s worst fantasy output since Week 14 of the 2023 season. This was not the kind of start fantasy managers were hoping for from the unquestioned No. 1 receiving option for the Texans. Perhaps the eventual return of Christian Kirk (hamstring) will help open things up for C.J. Stroud and the rest of the passing game following an abysmal Week 1 performance. Collins is too talented to be held down on a regular basis, so make sure to stick with your studs heading into next Monday’s tilt against the Buccaneers.</p> <h4 id="brock-bowers-te">Brock Bowers (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Per Pelissero, Bowers indicated afterward that he’s fine, with the tight end noting that he took a little hit on his knee (which he got checked out ) and that there are no concerns moving forward. Meanwhile, Vincent Bonsignore of the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports that Bowers wanted to return to Sunday’s game, but the Raiders’ training staff elected to hold him out. In any case, added context regarding Bowers’ Week 2 status will arrive no later than Thursday, when Las Vegas takes the practice field ahead of next Monday’s contest against the Chargers.</p> <h4 id="jaylen-waddle-wr">Jaylen Waddle (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Waddle’s quiet final line represented the collateral damage caused by an ugly performance from Tua Tagovailoa, who turned the ball over three times while managed just 114 passing yards overall. Waddle finished tied with Tyreek Hill for the team lead in receptions and also drew even with Malik Washington for runner-up status in targets, but it was naturally a very underwhelming day overall for the star receiver. The entire Dolphins air attack will aim for a reset in a Week 2 home matchup against the Patriots on Sunday, Sept. 14.</p> <h4 id="tua-tagovailoa-qb">Tua Tagovailoa (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br> <strong>Details:</strong> In a harbinger of the type of game it would be for the Dolphins offense and Tagovailoa in particular, the 2020 first-round pick sailed a pass intended for Tyreek Hill very high on the opening drive, leading to an interception by Camryn Bynum. The veteran signal-caller then handed the ball to the Colts again on the next possession, losing a fumble recovered by former teammate Xavien Howard. Tagovailoa would go on to short-circuit another possession with a third-quarter interception in Indianapolis territory, and only his 11-yard touchdown pass to De’Von Achane and subsequent two-point conversion pass to Julian Hill in the fourth quarter gave the signal-caller’s fantasy day any semblance of respectability. Tagovailoa’s first opportunity for atonement comes in a Week 2 home matchup next Sunday against a Patriots defense that allowed 362 yards to the Raiders’ Geno Smith in Week 1 while playing without Christian Gonzalez (hamstring).</p> <h4 id="jordan-mason-rb">Jordan Mason (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Mason comfortably led the Vikings in rush attempts and rushing yards, outpacing the only other running back to log a carry, Aaron Jones, by seven carries and 45 yards. The Week 1 usage between the two players is eye-catching to say the least, considering Jones is the established incumbent of the ground attack under a returning coaching staff. Nevertheless, Mason is a proven commodity as an offseason addition, and head coach Kevin O’Connell may be most comfortable affording the latter the bulk of early-down work on most weeks. The next opportunity to see how the pecking order shakes out comes in a Week 2 home matchup against the Falcons on Sunday night.</p> <h4 id="adam-thielen-wr">Adam Thielen (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Per Pelissero, Thielen volunteered to take less money in order to help the Vikings clear cap space and improve their chances of competing. It’s another indication that Thielen is thrilled to be back in Minnesota after two campaigns with Carolina. The Panthers dealt Thielen to the Vikings on Thursday, and the veteran wideout’s presence should help Minnesota absorb the early-season suspension of Jordan Addison, who won’t be available until Week 4.</p> <h4 id="garrett-wilson-wr">Garrett Wilson (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Wilson put the Jets in front with a 33-yard touchdown catch in the first quarter, and he came two yards from the end zone again on a 21-yard catch in the third, leading to a Justin Fields rushing score on the next play. He was the clear top option in the passing game, as Breece Hall was a distant second in both targets (four) and receiving yards (38), but Wilson will regret his inability to hold onto the ball on the Jets’ final offensive play, as Jalen Ramsey dislodged the ball from his hands on fourth down, preventing what would have been a game-extending catch. With Wilson showing strong chemistry with Fields, the talented wide receiver should remain a strong fantasy option against the Bills in Week 2.</p> <h4 id="jaylen-warren-rb">Jaylen Warren (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Warren led the Steelers’ backfield as expected, though he only out-carried Kenneth Gainwell 11-7. He had a disastrous first half, recording just four carries for nine yards, but he managed to make an impact in the second half with a long reception of 17 yards late in the third quarter, and he later capped the same drive with a five-yard touchdown catch. Warren managed a decent fantasy performance all told, but he may be reliant on big plays and touchdowns rather than volume, even as the lead back in Pittsburgh.</p> <h4 id="jauan-jennings-wr">Jauan Jennings (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Coach Kyle Shanahan noted Monday that Jennings’ initial test looked okay, but there are still more results to come. The wideout’s status thus is worth monitoring in the days ahead, but at this stage Shanahan believes that Jennings has a chance to play Sunday against the Saints, Jennifer Lee Chan of NBC Sports Bay Area reports. With Brandon Aiyuk (knee) still on the reserve/PUP list, Jennings now banged-up and Jordan Watkins dealing with an ankle injury, Ricky Pearsall currently is the 49ers’ top healthy WR, a context that could lead to some combo of Marquez Valdes-Scantling, Russell Gage, Kendrick Bourne and Skyy Moore seeing added opportunities Week 2.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table
