</code></pre> <hr> <h2 id="-player-report">🏥 Player Report</h2> <h3 id="-kirk-cousins-qb">🟢 Kirk Cousins (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Making his first start since Week 15 of last season, Cousins understandably had some rust to work through, and he also had the disadvantage of having to operate without No. 1 receiver Drake London (hip). Cousins eventually developed a bit of rhythm as the game went on, but he averaged just 5.6 yards per attempt and focused the overwhelming majority of his attention on Kyle Pitts. Cousins could certainly be better now that he has a game under his belt and with another week of practice -- not to mention with London at his disposal -- but it remains to be seen if he'll have that opportunity in a Week 9 road matchup against the Patriots or whether Penix will be healthy enough to start that game. </div> <h3 id="-lamar-jackson-qb">🟡 Lamar Jackson (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Jackson's listed activity level to begin Week 9 prep backs up language from coach John Harbaugh earlier Monday, when he told Jeff Zrebiec of The Athletic, "I feel very confident about it. I expect him to be out there Thursday." Jackson thus appears to have a good chance to put an end to a three-game absence due to a right hamstring injury for the Ravens' Week 9 contest at Miami. </div> <h3 id="-quinshon-judkins-rb">🟡 Quinshon Judkins (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Judkins was forced out of Sunday's loss to the Patriots in the third quarter, prior to which he rushed nine times for 19 yards and secured all three of his targets for minus-2 yards. To see the rookie second-round pick now labeled day-to-day is encouraging as to his odds of being ready to return to action after Cleveland's Week 9 bye, when the team will travel to face the Jets on Sunday, Nov. 9. If Judkins isn't ready to retake the field Week 10, however, Jerome Ford and Dylan Sampson will lead the Browns backfield. Ian Rapoport of NFL Network reports that Judkins is dealing with an AC joint sprain. </div> <h3 id="-jameson-williams-wr">🟢 Jameson Williams (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> The usually sure-handed Williams failed to haul in either of his targets on a low-volume passing night dominated by Detroit's run game. The 24-year-old has been a hit-or-miss fantasy asset through seven weeks, doing most of his damage in two big-scoring games. Williams couldn't improve on his 17-289-2 receiving line Monday as the Lions prepare to enter a bye week. The Alabama product should continue to be treated as a risky high-upside play against the Vikings in Week 9. </div> <h3 id="-nico-collins-wr">🟡 Nico Collins (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable </div> <h3 id="-jonathan-taylor-rb">🟢 Jonathan Taylor (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Taylor continues to score in threes, producing his fourth three-touchdown game in eight starts this season. It was the 26-year-old's second consecutive contest scoring thrice and the second time he has accomplished the feat against Tennessee this year. In addition to his monstrous rushing totals (143-850-13), Taylor has made strides as a receiver in 2025. The Wisconsin grad has 25 receptions for 206 yards and two touchdowns the midpoint of the schedule nears, a rate that would eclipse the 40-360-2 receiving line he posted during his breakout campaign back in 2021. Taylor will ride a wave of momentum into next Sunday's tilt against the Steelers' 19th-ranked rush defense. </div> <h3 id="-brock-bowers-te">🔴 Brock Bowers (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Questionable<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR<br> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable </div> <h3 id="-oronde-gadsden-ii-te">🟢 Oronde Gadsden II (TE)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Gadsden was second to Ladd McConkey in receptions and receiving yards while also tying for runner-up status in targets with Keenan Allen. The rookie tight end added his second career touchdown via an eight-yard scoring grab with just over four minutes remaining in the first quarter. The chemistry between Justin Herbert and Gadsden has spiked in the last three games, a stretch where they've connected for 19 catches, 309 yards and the two scores on 22 targets. Gadsden will aim to carry over the momentum into a favorable Week 9 road clash with the beatable Titans defense on Sunday, Nov. 2. </div> <h3 id="-kimani-vidal-rb">🟢 Kimani Vidal (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Following an impressive Week 6 showing against the Dolphins where Vidal compiled a career-best 124 yards, the 2024 sixth-round pick was stymied by the Colts to the tune of 20 yards on just nine carries Sunday. However, the second-year pro bounced back in spectacular fashion Thursday, averaging just over 5.0 yards per tote while rattling off three runs of double-digit yardage. He also added a three-yard scoring run early in the second quarter for his first NFL touchdown, rounding out his night nicely. Vidal appears fully capable of holding down the fort in the ground attack until Omarion Hampton (IR, ankle) is ready to return, and he could well put together a successful encore on the road in Week 9 when Los Angeles faces the vulnerable Titans on Nov. 2. </div> <h3 id="-tua-tagovailoa-qb">🟢 Tua Tagovailoa (QB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Tagovailoa came into the afternoon dealing with an illness that forced him onto the injury report early Sunday morning, but he and the Dolphins conquered heavy odds to deliver a completely unexpected comfortable victory. Tagovailoa tossed a season-high four touchdown passes, hitting running backs De'Von Achane and Ollie Gordon from three and 20 yards out, respectively, and sandwiching those throws around nine- and 43-yard scoring strikes to Malik Washington and Jaylen Waddle. This was a much-needed respite from both individual and team struggles for Tagovailoa and his teammates, but he'll have to turn around and face another talented defense in that of the Ravens during a Week 9 home matchup Thursday night. </div> <h3 id="-jaylen-waddle-wr">🟢 Jaylen Waddle (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Although he came up just short of the century mark, Waddle still paced the Dolphins in receptions and receiving yards while checking in second in targets. Nearly half of his yardage came on the highlight play of his afternoon, a 43-yard touchdown grab in the latter portion of the third quarter. Waddle's production has unsurprisingly picked up since Tyreek Hill's season-ending knee injury, as the talented fifth-year wideout has recorded at least 95 receiving yards in three of his last four games while logging at least six targets in each of those contests. Waddle next sets his sights on an inconsistent Ravens secondary, which he'll face off against in a Week 9 home matchup Thursday night. </div> <h3 id="-jordan-addison-wr">🟢 Jordan Addison (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> The Vikings' offense had a mostly forgettable performance as the final score indicates, but Addison still found a way to continue making an impact by recording a four-yard touchdown catch with just under five minutes remaining in the third quarter. Addison has scored twice over his first four games after the delayed start to his season, and he's likely to have his first regular-season opportunity to work with J.J. McCarthy (ankle) as his quarterback in a Week 9 road matchup against the Lions on Sunday, Nov. 2. </div> <h3 id="-garrett-wilson-wr">🟢 Garrett Wilson (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Out<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> out </div> <h3 id="-jaylen-warren-rb">🟢 Jaylen Warren (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Warren cooled off following last week's 127-yard rushing performance, reverting to the modest production he's logged most weeks as the Steelers' starter this season. The 26-year-old actually finished Sunday's primetime tilt right at the 62.2 yards he averaged over his previous five contests. Backup Kenneth Gainwell finished with 31 yards on five carries, but he coughed up Pittsburgh's only fumble on the evening. Warren carries a high floor as the Steelers' lead back heading into a Week 9 matchup against the Colts. </div> <h3 id="-jauan-jennings-wr">🟢 Jauan Jennings (WR)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Jennings finished as the team leader in receiving yards and targets while tying for the top mark in receptions as well, but his line could have been much fuller had the veteran wideout not dropped a catchable ball from Mac Jones midway through the third quarter. Jennings has consecutive four-catch tallies, but he's mostly been unable to capitalize on the ongoing absences of Brandon Aiyuk (PUP, knee) and Ricky Pearsall (knee). Jennings, who's dealt with multiple injuries in his own right and missed two games this season, will take an 18-212-1 receiving line on 36 targets into a Week 9 road matchup against the Giants. </div> <h3 id="-tyjae-spears-rb">🟢 Tyjae Spears (RB)</h3> <div style="padding: 10px; background-color: #f8f9fa; border-left: 4px solid #ddd; margin: 10px 0;"> <strong>Status:</strong> Active<br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE<br> <strong>Details:</strong> Tony Pollard led Tennessee with 11 carries, but Spears outproduced the veteran starter in every other facet Sunday. The nine carries also represented a new personal best through four healthy appearances this season. The 1-7 Titans may opt to feature the 24-year-old more prominently in the second half of the season if the team offense continues to struggle.
