</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="kyler-murray-qb">Kyler Murray (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Murray lacked explosiveness Sunday, generating just one play of 20 or more yards (a 32-yard pass to Marvin Harrison) in the narrow division loss. The 28-year-old has done a good job protecting the football this season, with last week’s interception accounting for his only turnover through three starts. Murray’s modest passing and rushing totals have built a high floor for his fantasy value heading into Thursday’s tilt against the Seahawks.</p> <h4 id="darnell-mooney-wr">Darnell Mooney (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> While it wasn’t a very efficient performance, Mooney did draw a team-high number of targets and finished tied for second in receptions while also slotting in as the runner-up in receiving yards. Mooney has multiple receptions in each of his first two games after missing Week 1 due to a shoulder injury, and he’ll next face off with the Commanders in a Week 4 home matchup.</p> <h4 id="kyle-pitts-sr-te">Kyle Pitts Sr. (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Even on a washout of a day for the Falcons’ offense as a whole, Pitts was able to maintain some of his early-season momentum while tying for second on the team in receptions and for third in targets. The talented tight end has enjoyed a steady presence in the air attack through three games, leading to a 15-135-0 receiving line on 19 targets. Pitts’ efficiency and chemistry with Michael Penix position him well to continue serving as a key complementary target in a Week 4 home matchup against the Commanders.</p> <h4 id="mark-andrews-te">Mark Andrews (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Another disappointing high-scoring loss for the Ravens took center stage, but Andrews’ individual performance was a highlight, especially for frustrated fantasy managers. The veteran led Baltimore in receptions and receiving yards, and he rounded out his night with touchdown grabs of 14 and 27 yards in the second half. Andrews’ numbers were easily season highs across the board, and he’ll likely need to contribute in a similar capacity for the Ravens to emerge with a much-needed win from a Week 4 road matchup against the Chiefs on Sunday.</p> <h4 id="keon-coleman-wr">Keon Coleman (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> The second-year wideout was tied for third in receptions for the Bills on the night, but that led to a very modest yardage total. Coleman got his season off to a memorable start with an 8-112-1 line against the Ravens in Buffalo’s wild Week 1 win, but he sports a combined 6-46-0 tally on seven targets over the subsequent pair of contests. The Bills haven’t been forced to be anywhere near as aggressive as in the opener against Baltimore, however, so Coleman retains plenty of upside in the right game environment. Nevertheless, a Week 4 home matchup against the Saints on Sunday, Sept. 28 could be another low-volume day for the air attack.</p> <h4 id="tetairoa-mcmillan-wr">Tetairoa McMillan (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> McMillan was plenty involved in the Panthers offense, as he doubled Carolina’s next-closest pass catcher in targets. That didn’t translate into much production, though he still showed impressive flashes, including making a leaping contested catch as well as a 23-yard reception out of the slot in the first quarter. McMillan has had a promising start to his rookie season, though his stat lines could be inconsistent due to the nature of the Panthers’ offense.</p> <h4 id="javonte-williams-rb">Javonte Williams (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Williams fumbled to end Dallas’ first offensive possession, though he wasn’t benched and continued to dominate touches while the game was competitive. His rushing volume was muted by game script as the Cowboys trailed for nearly the entire contest, but he was still efficient with his carries. Williams was also involved as a pass catcher and now has 11 combined receptions in the last two games. While he failed to find the end zone for the first time this season, this showing suggests that Williams has a clear hold on the lead-back role in Dallas.</p> <h4 id="josh-jacobs-rb">Josh Jacobs (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Jacobs got a first-hand taste of a run defense that has essentially been the AFC version of his own team’s unit in the early part of the season. The talented back only mustered a long gain of seven yards, and the Packers ultimately began swapping out targets for some of his normal allotment of rush attempts, leading to season highs in both receptions and receiving yards. Following the shocking upset, Jacobs and his teammates will look to rebound in an intriguing Week 4 road matchup against the Cowboys next Sunday night.</p> <h4 id="nick-chubb-rb">Nick Chubb (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Chubb saw a modest workload on the ground but still led the Texans in rush attempts on the afternoon. The veteran back has been solid in the early going now almost two years removed from his devastating early-season knee injury in 2023, with Chubb averaging 4.2 yards per carry and scoring a rushing TD on his 34 rush attempts to date. The veteran should continue to share early-down work with rookie Woody Marks during a Week 4 home matchup against the Titans next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="quentin-johnston-wr">Quentin Johnston (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Johnston broke free for a 37-yard reception that appeared to have him bottled up for a shorter gain only for the play to not be ruled dead, allowing the third-year receiver to scamper for additional yardage. His 10 targets were second on Los Angeles behind only Keenan Allen (11), and Johnston was frequently used on intermediate routes all over the field as well. That’s now consecutive games in which the 2023 first-round pick has finished top two in targets, all but solidifying his key role in the dynamic offense.</p> <h4 id="carson-wentz-qb">Carson Wentz (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Making the first of what project to be multiple starts in place of J.J. McCarthy (ankle), Wentz enjoyed some good fortune in the form of game script. The veteran signal-caller certainly had a hand in that by connecting with Josh Oliver on a 12-yard touchdown pass to cap off the opening possession, and the Vikings’ defense’s ability to repeatedly stymie fellow backup-turned-starter Jake Browning also played out favorably for Wentz in terms of being able to continue running a balanced offense. The Vikings eventually ran away with the game beginning in the second quarter, leaving Wentz in a low-pressure scenario that he thrived in. With McCarthy’s recovery expected to take multiple weeks, Wentz projects to remain under center when the Vikings face off with the Steelers in Dublin, Ireland next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="justin-jefferson-wr">Justin Jefferson (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br> <strong>Details:</strong> The Vikings obviously didn’t need to do much through the air after a certain point in the lopsided victory, but Jefferson managed to still put together a respectable fantasy day. The perennial Pro Bowler tied T.J. Hockenson for the team lead in receptions while also setting the pace in receiving yards and targets and working with Carson Wentz as his quarterback. Jefferson has yet to eclipse the 100-yard mark through three games this season, but he’s accrued an impressive 8-156-0 line over the last pair of contests heading into a Week 4 matchup against the Steelers in Ireland next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="treveyon-henderson-rb">TreVeyon Henderson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> The rookie RB struggled on the ground once again, failing to reached 30 rushing yards for the third straight game to begin his NFL career. His 14 touches were his highest volume so far, however, and the increase came largely due to the fact that his competition for backfield work, Rhamondre Stevenson and Antonio Gibson, combined to lose three fumbles. That could put Henderson at the top of the depth chart Week 4 against a Panthers defense that remains fairly vulnerable on the ground and just gave up 111 yards from scrimmage to Bijan Robinson.</p> <h4 id="malik-nabers-wr">Malik Nabers (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br> <strong>Details:</strong> The Giants were unable to replicate their offensive success from Week 2, which led to a very disappointing showing for Nabers. Many of his seven targets came in highly contested situations on passes that were nearly uncatchable, though he was finally schemed two short receptions in the fourth quarter. Nabers’ talent isn’t in question, but performances like this will happen occasionally given the current state of the Giants’ offense. Nabers did leave the game briefly in the second half after breaking up a potential interception, but he returned shortly afterward and finished the game.</p> <h4 id="justin-fields-qb">Justin Fields (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR <br> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable</p> <h4 id="mac-jones-qb">Mac Jones (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Jones got another spot start for Brock Purdy (left shoulder/toe) in Week 3, completing 27 of 41 passes for 284 yards, one touchdown and one interception and losing one yard on his only carry. Late in the contest, though, Jones was visibly hobbled, and he told reporters afterward about the lingering knee issue, per Ian Rapoport of NFL Network. Meanwhile, Shanahan also relayed to Wagoner on Monday that Purdy will resume practicing this week after doing so in a limited fashion last week. The 49ers likely will roll with whoever is healthiest among Purdy and Jones on Sunday against the Jaguars considering practice-squad member Adrian Martinez currently is the only other QB in San Francisco that’s eligible to be on the active roster for game days.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-search="false" data-toggle="table"
