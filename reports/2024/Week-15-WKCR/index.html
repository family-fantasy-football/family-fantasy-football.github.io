</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="tyler-allgeier-rb">Tyler Allgeier (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Allgeier logged his highest carry total since Week 8 in the run-centric win, pushing his rushing yardage tally over the last two games to 106 across 21 attempts. Allgeier was left out of the passing game altogether for the second straight contest, and he remains in a strict complementary role to Bijan Robinson, who’s now received at least 22 carries in three straight contests, heading into a Week 16 home matchup against the Giants.</p> <h4 id="mark-andrews-te">Mark Andrews (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Andrews’ 13-yard scoring grab late in the first quarter had extra significance, as it made the veteran tight end the Ravens’ all-time leader in touchdown catches with 48. Andrews was quiet the remainder of the afternoon, but he’s now scored in three straight games heading into a Week 16 home matchup against the Steelers on Saturday afternoon.</p> <h4 id="derrick-henry-rb">Derrick Henry (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> With Lamar Jackson throwing five touchdown passes, Henry was in the rare role of forgotten man on offense Sunday. The bruising back’s non-descript afternoon was his first of under 70 rushing yards without a touchdown during his nascent but stellar Ravens tenure. Henry may have a tough time bouncing back in a Week 16 Saturday afternoon home matchup against the Steelers considering the quality of Pittsburgh’s run defense.</p> <h4 id="lamar-jackson-qb">Lamar Jackson (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Jackson, as he’s prone to do on occasion, was locked in as a passer throughout the afternoon, with Baltimore somewhat surprisingly staying aggressive through the air despite the tepid threat posed by the Giants offense. The perennial MVP candidate connected with Mark Andrews for a 13-yard scoring strike to kick things off late in the first quarter, and he subsequently hit Rashod Bateman for touchdown tosses of 49 and 20 yards before intermission. Jackson’s final two TD passes of the prolific afternoon went to Devontez Walker (21 yards) and Justice Hill (27 yards) in the third and fourth quarters, respectively, giving the talented signal-caller his second five-TD tally of the campaign. Jackson also has compiled 144 rushing yards on just 14 attempts over his last two games, but he’ll be hard-pressed to replicate his stellar production in a Week 16 Saturday afternoon home matchup versus a Steelers team he’s traditionally struggled against throughout his career.</p> <h4 id="amari-cooper-wr">Amari Cooper (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Fresh off a big Week 14 performance in the Bills’ 44-42 loss to the Rams in which he recorded six catches for 95 yards on a season-high 14 targets, Cooper unexpectedly saw no involvement at all Sunday in another high-scoring affair. Though his snap share (46 percent) was similar to last week’s 54 percent rate, Cooper didn’t garner any looks on any of the 34 pass attempts from quarterback Josh Allen, who spread the ball around to nine different pass catchers. The Buffalo offense is rolling at the moment and doesn’t look on track to slow down with the team facing two relatively unimposing defenses in the Patriots (twice) and Jets (once) over the final three games of the regular season, but Cooper’s weekly output looks like it could be highly volatile down the stretch while Allen relies on an array of playmakers rather than a narrower usage tree.</p> <h4 id="keon-coleman-wr">Keon Coleman (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Coleman, who last played Week 9, was deemed a full participant in Wednesday’s walkthrough, Thursday’s practice estimate and finally in Friday’s session. Now that he’s been cleared to face Detroit, the rookie rejoins a Buffalo wideout corps that also includes Amari Cooper, Khalil Shakir, Mack Hollins and Curtis Samuel. With that in mind, it remains to be seen what sort of volume Coleman will see in his looming return, a context that makes the Florida State product a speculative Week 15 fantasy option. Prior to his injury, Coleman had a 22-417-3 line on 36 targets in nine games.</p> <h4 id="dj-moore-wr">DJ Moore (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Moore led the Bears in receptions despite seeing five fewer targets than fellow wideout Keenan Allen. The latter produced the better fantasy score after reeling in his fourth touchdown in as many weeks, but Moore provided an especially strong line for those in PPR formats. Expect both of Chicago’s top receivers to be busy in Week 16 with a tough matchup on tap against the Lions on Sunday.</p> <h4 id="caleb-williams-qb">Caleb Williams (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Williams kept his touchdown streak alive at four games, but it came in a futile effort against a division foe. The rookie signal-caller also coughed up his second fumble in as many games, bringing him up to four fumbles lost and five interceptions through 14 games. It’s been a rocky road for Williams in his first season with Chicago, and he will have to take on a hungry Lions squad on Sunday that was just shown up at home by the Bills in Week 15. Hopefully there are more reliable fantasy options for fantasy managers whose playoff hopes are still alive.</p> <h4 id="jamarr-chase-wr">Ja’Marr Chase (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Chase didn’t account for any of Joe Burrow’s three first-half touchdown passes, but the star wideout posted a team-high 79 receiving yards heading into the locker room. The Bengals nursed a comfortable lead throughout the second half and didn’t turn to the air much, though Chase still finished with team-leading totals in targets, catches and receiving yards. Chase will look to add to his impressive season totals of 102 catches for 1,413 yards and 15 touchdowns in Week 16 against the Browns.</p> <h4 id="rico-dowdle-rb">Rico Dowdle (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Dowdle was coming off a career-best 131 rushing-yard performance, but he outpaced that mark in Sunday’s blowout win. He had a solid first half but was relied upon to burn clock in the final two quarters, when he tallied 14 attempts for 91 yards. The only downside to Dowdle’s performance was that he couldn’t find the end zone, but he’s suddenly one of the league’s most productive backs, having topped 100 yards on the ground in three straight contests.</p> <h4 id="javonte-williams-rb">Javonte Williams (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Williams continued his late-season slump, which has seen him exceed 25 total yards only once in his last five games. Jaleel McLaughlin led Denver’s running backs with seven carries for 21 yards prior to exiting due to a quadriceps injury, and quarterback Bo Nix finished as the team’s leading rusher with eight rushing attempts for 23 yards. There could be more opportunities available for Williams if McLaughlin’s unable to suit up against the Chargers on Thursday, though rookie Audric Estime could also see more touches.</p> <h4 id="josh-downs-wr">Josh Downs (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Downs has just 59 receiving yards over his last two appearances, sandwiched around a one-game absence due to a shoulder injury. He had at least 60 yards in seven of his last eight games prior to this downturn, though much of that stretch came with Joe Flacco under center rather than the erratic Anthony Richardson, who threw for only 172 yards in the loss to Denver. Downs will look to get back on track in Week 16 against the Titans.</p> <h4 id="brock-bowers-te">Brock Bowers (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Bowers saw his usage suppressed for the second week in a row, also finishing below 50 yards receiving for the third time in four contests. Backup tight end Michael Mayer (1-11-0) didn’t cut into the starter’s workload like we saw Week 14, so the low usage was a result of the Raiders’ game plan against Atlanta. Despite his recent dry spell, Bowers is a tremendous talent who is worth starting Week 16 against Jacksonville on Sunday.</p> <h4 id="puka-nacua-wr">Puka Nacua (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Nacua comfortably led the Rams in receptions, receiving yards and targets, with his night boosted significantly by a 51-yard grab to ignite an early fourth-quarter drive. The second-year standout now has at least seven receptions and Thursday’s yardage tally in six of the eight games he’s played since returning from an IR stint due to a knee injury, affording him plenty of momentum heading into a Week 16 road matchup against the Jets on Sunday, Dec. 22.</p> <h4 id="tua-tagovailoa-qb">Tua Tagovailoa (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Tagovailoa’s final line underscores how much of a sluggish afternoon it was for the talented quarterback, even in the climate-controlled conditions of NRG Stadium. The fact Jaylen Waddle exited the game with a knee injury in the first half and never returned certainly didn’t help Tagovailoa’s cause, but he played the biggest role in his and the Dolphins’ undoing with his four turnovers, the first two of which helped lead to 10 points for the Texans. Tagovailoa’s final miscue of the afternoon, his third interception of the season, was the most ill-timed, considering it came on the first play of what could have evolved into a game-tying drive for Miami. The fifth-year pro had thrown just four interceptions all season coming in, but Sunday marked his second three-pick tally of the season. Tagovailoa will look to keep the Dolphins’ increasingly thin playoff hopes alive against a tough defense similar in style and caliber to that of the Texans when he faces the 49ers in a Week 16 home clash.</p> <h4 id="jalen-mcmillan-wr">Jalen McMillan (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> McMillan followed up his breakout performance against Las Vegas in Week 14 with another gem against Los Angeles on Sunday. The speedy rookie is coming into his own as the No. 2 option behind star wideout Mike Evans (9-159-2). McMillan has racked up 134 yards and three touchdowns over his last two contests. The third-round selection has leapfrogged his way from fantasy afterthought to a potential playoff hero for managers across all formats. McMillan can really put his name on the map under the bright lights in Dallas when the Buccaneers visit the Cowboys for Sunday Night Football in Week 16.</p> <h4 id="tyjae-spears-rb">Tyjae Spears (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Spears has been surprisingly uninvolved in the Tennessee offense for much of the season, though he exploded for a big showing Sunday. He finished off the team’s second possession with a one-yard touchdown leap, his only impact as a rusher in the game. However, Spears produced very well as a pass catcher with Mason Rudolph under center and the Titans chasing points in the fourth quarter, highlighted by a long gain of 43 yards as well as a 17-yard touchdown reception. Tony Pollard remains the lead back, though Spears may have be able to carve out a more significant role across the final four games of the season.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2>
