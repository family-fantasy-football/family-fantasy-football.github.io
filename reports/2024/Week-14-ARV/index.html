</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="kyler-murray-qb">Kyler Murray (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Murray threw a 41-yard touchdown pass to Michael Wilson on the opening drive, but the quarterback was picked off on the next two possessions, which helped Seattle build a 24-10 halftime lead. Murray closed the gap to 27-18 in the third quarter with a two-yard touchdown pass to James Conner followed by a Murray rush for a two-point conversion, but that’s as close as Arizona would get. While Murray tossed multiple touchdown passes for only the third time this season, he also finished with multiple interceptions for the second consecutive game after having no multi-interception games through Week 12. He’ll look to clean up the mistakes in Week 15 against the Patriots.</p> <h4 id="kirk-cousins-qb">Kirk Cousins (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Morris said Cousins “is the guy who is going to lead us” heading into a primetime matchup against Las Vegas next Monday, reaffirming the notion that Atlanta still isn’t considering giving rookie first-round pick Michael Penix even a spot start. Still, the Falcons now have lost four consecutive games, during which Cousins has thrown eight interceptions without a single touchdown. If Atlanta’s passing game were to notably struggle once again in Week 15, Morris’ commitment to Cousins could waver.</p> <h4 id="zay-flowers-wr">Zay Flowers (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Flowers finished as the Ravens’ leading receiver Sunday, but both of Lamar Jackson’s passing scores went to tight ends (Mark Andrews and Isaiah Likely). The 23-year-old Flowers set a new personal best for receiving yards in a season (863) in three fewer games compared to his strong rookie campaign in 2023. The budding sophomore has become a solid option across all fantasy leagues while serving as Baltimore’s No. 1 wideout this year. The Ravens will enter a bye week before resuming play against the Giants on Dec. 15.</p> <h4 id="curtis-samuel-wr">Curtis Samuel (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Samuel upgraded to full practice participation Friday after a pair of limited sessions, eliminating any doubt about his availability for Sunday’s matchup at SoFi Stadium. He has just 185 receiving yards and one touchdown in what has been a disappointing first season in Buffalo, and Samuel will likely see limited usage against the Rams, especially if rookie wideout Keon Coleman (questionable, wrist) suits up.</p> <h4 id="nick-chubb-rb">Nick Chubb (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Chubb was in an even split in the backfield with Jerome Ford for the entire day. While that limited his volume, Chubb did manage a 19-yard run – his longest of the season. He’s now gained between 48 and 59 yards on the ground in four of his seven games this season, though the ongoing split in the backfield will continue to limit his fantasy appeal.</p> <h4 id="david-montgomery-rb">David Montgomery (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Montgomery capped off the opening possession of the game with a three-yard walk-in rushing touchdown, his fifth in the last five games. The veteran back generally found running room at a premium, but he set a new season high in receptions and targets. Montgomery has consistently complemented his work on the ground with solid production through the air of late, as he’ll head into a Week 15 home showdown against the Bills on Sunday, Dec. 15 with a 14-143-0 line on 14 targets in the last four contests.</p> <h4 id="christian-watson-wr">Christian Watson (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Watson’s night got off to an inconspicuous start when he lost a fumble after a 20-yard reception on the first play of the second quarter. While that mistake led to a Lions field goal, Watson came back to record a 59-yard catch on the Packers’ second play of the second half, and he went on to add a 29-yard grab with just under eight minutes remaining in the contest. The game marked Watson’s second over the 100-yard mark for the season, and he’s recorded at least 67 receiving yards in three of the last four contests. Watson’s production still is subject to some game-to-game volatility, but he could be in line for another robust role in a Week 15 road matchup against the Seahawks on Sunday, Dec. 15, especially if Romeo Doubs (concussion) isn’t able to make it back for that contest.</p> <h4 id="adonai-mitchell-wr">Adonai Mitchell (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> It was a disappointing performance from the rookie, who moved into a larger role with Josh Downs out due to a shoulder injury. Mitchell started opposite Michael Pittman in a two-receiver set to begin the game and played 35 of the offense’s 62 snaps while running 16 routes. Mitchell could get a chance to bounce back after Indy’s bye in Week 14, as it’s not immediately clear if Downs will be ready to return.</p> <h4 id="travis-etienne-jr-rb">Travis Etienne Jr. (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Etienne saw his rushing role diminish significantly in Tank Bigsby’s second game back from an ankle injury, and he was out-touched 19-8. That will make Etienne tough to trust moving forward for fantasy purposes, though he did show promise as a receiver. He finished third on the team with four targets and second in yardage – highlighted by a 21-yard catch and run late in the first quarter.</p> <h4 id="xavier-worthy-wr">Xavier Worthy (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Worthy made one of the game’s biggest plays down the stretch, converting on third-and-10 with a 14-yard catch to extend a drive that culminated in Matthew Wright’s game-winning 31-yard field goal. The rookie speedster has exceeded 40 receiving yards in four consecutive games after reaching that threshold only twice in his first nine appearances. Worthy will look to extend that streak in Week 15 against the Browns.</p> <h4 id="travis-kelce-te">Travis Kelce (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Kelce became the fastest tight end in NFL history to reach 12,000 career receiving yards, doing so in his 172nd regular-season game. Tony Gonzalez had the previous record at 210 games. Kelce’s team-high 45 receiving yards included a nine-yard catch on third-and-7 coming out of the two-minute warning in the fourth quarter, which allowed Kansas City to run the clock down to one second before Matthew Wright kicked a game-winning 31-yard field goal. Heading into a Week 15 road game against the Browns, Kelce has 80 catches for 682 yards and two touchdowns this season.</p> <h4 id="alexander-mattison-rb">Alexander Mattison (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> questionable</p> <h4 id="gus-edwards-rb">Gus Edwards (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> The bruising running back scored just his second touchdown of the season. For a second consecutive week Edwards led the team in carries, but rookie Kimani Vidal was also a factor, tallying eight carries for 34 yards. The backfield breakdown is worth monitoring with J.K. Dobbins (knee) still on injured reserve for at minimum two more weeks, but it’s becoming clear Los Angeles’ rushing attack just doesn’t have the same gusto it did when Dobbins was one of the bell cows.</p> <h4 id="taysom-hill-te">Taysom Hill (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Injured Reserve <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> A torn ACL suffered Week 13 rules Hill out for the rest of the season and makes him uncertain for Week 1 of 2025. He’ll be 35 years old at that point, and it’s not entirely clear he’ll still be with the Saints. In the meantime, Juwan Johnson and Foster Moreau figure to get snaps/targets as a result of Hill’s injury.</p> <h4 id="garrett-wilson-wr">Garrett Wilson (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Wilson beat Jalen Ramsey for a 35-yard catch on fourth down in the second quarter, and Isaiah Davis scored a 17-yard rushing touchdown on the very next play. The star wide receiver tacked on a 42-yard catch on the second play of the second half and ultimately finished with five more receiving yards than Davante Adams to lead the team. This was a welcome turnaround for Wilson, who had just 100 receiving yards over his previous three games combined. Wilson will have a nice opportunity to build on this performance in Week 15 against the beatable Jacksonville secondary.</p> <h4 id="devonta-smith-wr">DeVonta Smith (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> While his yardage was modest in his return from a two-game absence due to a hamstring strain, Smith connected with Jalen Hurts for a four-yard score just before halftime. It’s Smith’s first TD since Week 9, and he also hasn’t reached 40 receiving yards in any of his three appearances during that stretch. He’ll try to build on Sunday’s effort in Week 15 against the Steelers.</p> <h4 id="tony-pollard-rb">Tony Pollard (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Pollard turned in a needed bounceback performance after managing only 35 yards on the ground in Week 13, and he delivered three rushes that went for a double-digit gain. He topped the century mark in rushing yards for the third time this season, all of which have come in his last six games. Pollard will remain an inconsistent option due to the poor Tennessee offense, but it’s clear that he is a driving force for the unit.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-height="630" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_14_2024_ARV_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br><br></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-height="630" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_14_2024_ARV_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> </div> </article> <br> <hr> <br> <ul class="list-disc pl-8"></ul> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-15_links/">Week 15 Links</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-16_preview/">Week 16 Matchups Preview</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-15_Recap/">Week 15 League Recap</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-15-EET/">Emma's Excellent Team Week 15 Report</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-15-TIB/">To Infinity and Bijan!
