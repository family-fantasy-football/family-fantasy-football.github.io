</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="james-conner-rb">James Conner (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Conner caught a two-yard touchdown pass late in the third quarter on an underhand pass from Kyler Murray for the veteran running back’s first receiving touchdown of the season. This was also Conner’s highest rushing yardage total since Week 9, as he had only 109 yards on the ground in three games in between. Conner will look to build off this bounce-back effort in a favorable Week 15 matchup against the 3-10 Patriots.</p> <h4 id="rashod-bateman-wr">Rashod Bateman (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Bateman was forced out of Baltimore’s loss to the Eagles in Week 13 due to what head coach John Harbaugh described as knee soreness, so it’s encouraging to see him back on the practice field. The Ravens’ bye week was well-timed for Bateman, who will continue to work at ramping up his health, with the target of retaking the field Sunday versus the Giants. Wednesday’s first official practice report of the week will reveal whether Bateman is practicing in full or being capped as a limited participant.</p> <h4 id="khalil-shakir-wr">Khalil Shakir (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Shakir was a non-factor in the first half, recording only 21 yards on two targets. He came alive as the offenses matched blows in the final two quarters, however, highlighted by a 51-yard touchdown grab, which came primarily after the catch as he bounced off defenders. On Buffalo’s next possession, Shakir caught a 34-yard pass from Josh Allen that finished just one yard shy of another trip to the end zone. This was Shakir’s second 100-yard performance of the season and his first touchdown since Week 3.</p> <h4 id="adam-thielen-wr">Adam Thielen (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> It’s the first time this season that Thielen has topped 100 yards, with his last such performance coming in Week 6 of the 2023 campaign. The veteran wideout has posted a 20-258-1 line on 25 targets over three games since returning from a hamstring injury, giving him significant momentum heading into a Week 15 matchup against the Cowboys.</p> <h4 id="jameis-winston-qb">Jameis Winston (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Stefanski noted that despite being eliminated from playoff contention, the Browns’ focus is “just trying to find ways to get a win,” and to that end, Winston is seen as a better candidate to direct the offense than backup Dorian Thompson-Robinson. Winston – who has logged a 2-4 record as the team’s starter – thus is slated to face the 12-1 Chiefs this weekend following a Week 14 outing in which he completed 24 of 41 passes for 212 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions in a 27-14 loss to the Steelers.</p> <h4 id="elijah-moore-wr">Elijah Moore (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Moore was expected to benefit from condensed targets in the absence of Cedric Tillman (concussion). That wasn’t the case against the Steelers, however, as Jameis Winston targeted seven different pass catchers multiple times. That left Moore with a mediocre line, and he’s now had 35 or fewer receiving yards in two of his last four games.</p> <h4 id="jahmyr-gibbs-rb">Jahmyr Gibbs (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Gibbs and backfield mate David Montgomery struggled to find consistent running room, and 20 of Gibbs’ rushing yards actually came on one carry. However, the second-year back tied Tim Patrick for the lead in receptions and recorded his second receiving touchdown of the season on a two-yard catch just before halftime. Gibbs now has four total touchdowns (three rushing, one receiving) over the last four games heading into a Week 15 home clash against the Bills on Sunday, Dec. 15.</p> <h4 id="evan-engram-te">Evan Engram (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Engram’s six targets were good for second on the team and also marked his fifth straight game with at least that many opportunities. However, his longest catch went for just 11 yards as the Jacksonville offense struggled to generate explosive plays. Engram has now been held below 40 yards in half of his last eight games.</p> <h4 id="brian-thomas-jr-wr">Brian Thomas Jr. (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Thomas was one of the few players to get going in an ugly offensive showing from both teams. He delivered splash plays of 31 and 21 yards on the Jaguars’ only touchdown drive of the game, setting up a rushing score for Tank Bigsby. Despite otherwise being limited to short gains, Thomas has at least 75 receiving yards and four receptions in each of his last three games.</p> <h4 id="kyren-williams-rb">Kyren Williams (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Williams saw a season-high 29 rushing attempts, his first time topping 20 carries since Week 9. He wasn’t very efficient, as he averaged only 3.0 yards per carry with his longest run going for 12 yards. However, volume was enough to carry Williams’ fantasy performance, and he also supplemented his yardage with three- and seven-yard rushing scores. He now has a touchdown in three straight contests and has at least 80 rushing yards in three of his last four games.</p> <h4 id="tyrone-tracy-jr-rb">Tyrone Tracy Jr. (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> The rookie running back punched in a one-yard score late in the fourth quarter, giving Tracy his fifth rushing TD in the last eight games. Over that stretch, he’s amassed 680 scrimmage yards while solidifying his spot at the top of the Giants’ backfield depth chart. Tracy faces a tough matchup on the ground in Week 15 against the Ravens.</p> <h4 id="jalen-hurts-qb">Jalen Hurts (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> For the third straight game and the sixth time this season, Hurts failed to throw for 200 yards, with Sunday’s total being his lowest of the year. He made up for it by producing three TDs, including a four-yard strike to Grant Calcaterra early in the fourth quarter for what proved to be the winning score. Hurts has 13 rushing touchdowns on the season, leaving him two short of tying the NFL quarterback record of 15 he shares with Josh Allen, a mark they both reached in 2023. Hurts faces a stingy secondary in Week 15 against the Steelers.</p> <h4 id="isaac-guerendo-rb">Isaac Guerendo (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Guerendo will go down as a non-participant on the 49ers’ second injury report of the week. With the 49ers facing a quick turnaround from Sunday’s win over the Bears with a Thursday night matchup with the Rams, the rookie running back looks like he may be facing an uphill battle to gain clearance after exiting the Week 14 contest with a sprained foot. Before departing with the injury, Guerendo showed well in his first NFL start, carrying 15 times for 78 yards and two touchdowns to go with two catches for 50 yards. If the Louisville product ends up missing Thursday’s game, Patrick Taylor, Ke’Shawn Vaughn and Israel Abanikanda would represent the 49ers’ available options at running back.</p> <h4 id="deebo-samuel-sr-wr">Deebo Samuel Sr. (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Samuel was seemingly the only key member of the 49ers not to wake up in Sunday’s landslide victory over the lowly Bears. The dual-threat star couldn’t get anything going on the ground while George Kittle (6-151-0) and Jauan Jennings (7-90-2) did all the work in the passing game. Samuel is currently mired in a four-game slump that has resulted in 22 or fewer receiving yards in each contest during that span. This Thursday’s crucial matchup against the Rams – who just gave up 42 points in a win over the Bills – is a prime opportunity for Samuel to look like his former self. If he turns in yet another stinker, managers may have to consider what was once unthinkable – benching the star player due to poor performance as many fantasy leagues enter the playoffs.</p> <h4 id="cade-otton-te">Cade Otton (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> The third-year tight end finished with a team-high receiving yardage figure and ranked second in receptions as well. The highlight of Otton’s afternoon was a 44-yard reception in the fourth quarter that helped set up the Buccaneers’ final touchdown of the game, and Sunday marked his most productive showing since a Week 9, 77-yard effort against the Chiefs. Otton should continue to be an integral part of the Buccaneers’ shorthanded passing attack in a Week 15 road matchup against the Chargers.</p> <h4 id="jayden-daniels-qb">Jayden Daniels (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Daniels gave the Commanders a 14-0 lead with a three-yard rushing touchdown, then doubled that first-half advantage with touchdown passes of 16 and three yards to Terry McLaurin. The rookie second overall pick missed only one of his 15 first-half pass attempts but was picked off in the third quarter as the Titans cut what was once a 28-point Washington lead to 28-13 heading into the fourth quarter. He bounced back with a four-yard touchdown pass to Zach Ertz early in the fourth to snuff out any hopes of a Tennessee comeback. Daniels has thrown 15 touchdown passes and run in six touchdowns to lead the Commanders to an 8-5 record heading into their Week 14 bye.</p> <h4 id="terry-mclaurin-wr">Terry McLaurin (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br> <strong>Details:</strong> McLaurin extended Washington’s advantage to 21-0 with a 16-yard touchdown catch in the final minute of the first quarter, then caught a three-yard touchdown in the second quarter. After getting off to slow starts in recent weeks, McLaurin piled up six catches for 52 yards and two touchdowns in the first half of this lopsided win. He wasn’t heavily involved in the second half as the Commanders rode their running game while nursing a hefty lead. McLaurin has three multi-touchdown games and nine receiving scores overall heading into Washington’s Week 14 bye.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-height="630" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_14_2024_PONY_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br><br></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-height="630" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_14_2024_PONY_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> </div> </article> <br> <hr> <br> <ul class="list-disc pl-8"></ul> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-0/">Year 2 League Changes</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-18_preview/">Week 18 Matchups Preview</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-17_Recap/">Week 17 League Recap</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-17-WKCR/">Who Killed Charbonnet Ramsey?
