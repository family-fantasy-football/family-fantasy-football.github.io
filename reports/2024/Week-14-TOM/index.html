</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="justice-hill-rb">Justice Hill (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Hill saw his customary level of usage while working in a change-of-pace role behind Derrick Henry. Hill’s volume has been remarkably consistent heading into Baltimore’s Week 14 bye. He has totaled between six and eight touches nine times this season while falling short of six three times and exceeding eight just once, when Hill had four carries and six catches against the Bills back in Week 4.</p> <h4 id="jerome-ford-rb">Jerome Ford (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Ford’s 13 touches were his most since coming back a hamstring injury in Week 9. He was on the field for 40 snaps, more than starter Nick Chubb (26) for the second consecutive game, but that has more to do with Cleveland playing from behind. The Browns have attempted more than 40 passes six times in the seven games since Jameis Winston has taken over at quarterback. That’s a situation that benefits Ford, who leads the backfield with 36 targets.</p> <h4 id="jerry-jeudy-wr">Jerry Jeudy (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Jeudy couldn’t match his Week 13 explosion, but he remained productive with Jameis Winston under center. He began his performance with a long 35-yard touchdown catch after splitting the defense down the seam. While the Browns’ offense was stalled for much of the contest thereafter, Jeudy did manage to remain a reliable target. Jeudy has now topped 70 receiving yards and/or found the end zone in each of Winston’s six starts.</p> <h4 id="jake-ferguson-te">Jake Ferguson (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Making his return from a two-game absence due to a concussion, Ferguson finished second in receptions, receiving yards and targets for the Cowboys on the night. Cooper Rush only threw for 183 yards overall, so Ferguson’s production was serviceable if unspectacular in that context. The promising tight end draws a favorable matchup in a Week 15 road clash with the Panthers.</p> <h4 id="tucker-kraft-te">Tucker Kraft (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Kraft was second in receptions, tied for second in targets and was third in receiving yards for the Packers on a night when Jordan Love only completed 12 passes. The versatile tight end has demonstrated a knack for rattling off chunk plays throughout the season, and he recorded his sixth catch of 20-plus yards Thursday with a 21-yard grab. Kraft also tallied his career-high seventh touchdown on a 12-yard catch that capped off Green Bay’s first second-half drive, and he should have opportunities to make an impact again during a Week 15 road matchup against the Seahawks on Sunday night, Dec. 15.</p> <h4 id="jordan-love-qb">Jordan Love (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Love averaged an impressive 10.3 yards per attempt, but he recorded his second-fewest number of pass attempts this season against a Lions squad that had forced opponents to the air plenty. With stalwart interior lineman DJ Reader (shoulder) sidelined and fellow defensive tackle Alim McNeill (head) exiting for the Lions early in the contest, the Packers were able to lean on Josh Jacobs on the ground about as much as usual, and Love was also the victim of Detroit’s 12-minute-plus time-of-possession advantage. His one touchdown pass went to Tucker Kraft from 12 yards out to cap off the first possession of the second half, a drive Love ignited with a 59-yard completion to Christian Watson. The fourth-year signal-caller does now have a three-game interception-less streak, and Love should be more active through the air in a key Week 15 road matchup against the Seahawks on Sunday night, Dec. 15.</p> <h4 id="josh-jacobs-rb">Josh Jacobs (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Jacobs had a fourth touchdown via a six-yard reception nullified by an offensive pass interference penalty on Christian Watson with just under five minutes remaining in the game. The standout back found the end zone on the ground from one, six and four yards out in the second, third and fourth quarters, respectively, his second three-touchdown effort of the season. Jacobs also officially went without a catch for the third time overall in 2024, but his near complete domination of Green Bay’s backfield and his massive red-zone usage keeps him as an elite option in a Week 15 road matchup against the Seahawks on Sunday night, Dec. 15.</p> <h4 id="tank-dell-wr">Tank Dell (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Dell recorded his sole catch early in the fourth quarter, a reflection of how unusually quiet the speedy second-year wideout’s afternoon was. Dell’s target total also tied a season low, and his yardage was his fewest since Week 8. The 2023 third-round pick will now have a Week 14 bye to rest up before resuming a quest to snap what is now a five-game touchdown drought at the expense of the Dolphins in a Week 15 home matchup Sunday, Dec. 15.</p> <h4 id="alec-pierce-wr">Alec Pierce (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> The third-year wideout dealt with a foot injury in practice this week, and while he was eventually cleared to play, Pierce appeared headed for a very quiet day until he caught a three-yard TD from Anthony Richardson with just 12 seconds left in the fourth quarter for what seemed to be the tying score. Rather than sending the game to overtime with an extra point though, coach Shane Steichen put the ball in Richardson’s hands, and the young QB ran in a two-point conversion for the win. The touchdown was Pierce’s fifth of the season after he managed only four across his first two NFL campaigns, and he’ll get a bye in Week 14 to let his foot heal further.</p> <h4 id="patrick-mahomes-qb">Patrick Mahomes (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Mahomes put the Chiefs up 13-0 with a nine-yard touchdown pass to DeAndre Hopkins in the final minute of the first half, but the Chargers scored 14 unanswered points in the third quarter. The two teams then exchanged go-ahead field goals in the fourth quarter before Mahomes converted a pair of third downs with passes of 14 yards to Xavier Worthy and nine yards to Travis Kelce to set up Matthew Wright’s game-winning 31-yard field goal on the game’s final play. It hasn’t always been pretty offensively as Kansas City navigates subpar offensive line play with a depleted receiving corps, but Mahomes has led the Chiefs to a 12-1 record and an AFC West Division title heading into a Week 15 trip to Cleveland.</p> <h4 id="jonnu-smith-te">Jonnu Smith (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Smith stepped up in overtime after being blanked in regulation. He caught consecutive screen passes for gains of 20 and 14 yards, then scored the game-winning touchdown on a 10-yard catch five plays later. This was Smith’s lowest yardage total since Week 8, but the surging tight end has 345 receiving yards and four touchdowns in his last four games. He’ll look to stay hot in Week 15 against the Texans.</p> <h4 id="alvin-kamara-rb">Alvin Kamara (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> The game was a slog for both offenses, and Kamara’s 44 rushing yards was his lowest total since Week 7. The star running back did catch at least four passes for the 10th straight game however, and his 64 receptions on the season leads all RBs, just ahead of De’Von Achane (63). Kamara is just 73 scrimmage yards short of reaching 1,500 for the fourth time in his career and the first time since 2020, and he needs 62 more rushing yards to hit 1,000 for the first time. He’ll take aim at both marks in Week 15 against the Commanders.</p> <h4 id="aj-brown-wr">A.J. Brown (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br> <strong>Details:</strong> The fifth-year wideout tied for his lowest target volume of the season, but Brown still led the Eagles in receiving yards on a day in which Jalen Hurts threw for just 108 yards. With Saquon Barkley clearly the focal point of the Philly offense, it’s become harder for Brown to make a big impact, and he’s scored only one TD over the last seven games while posting a 32-512-1 line on 42 targets. He’ll try to turn things around in Week 15 against the Steelers.</p> <h4 id="mike-williams-wr">Mike Williams (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> The Steelers had limited pass volume, with Russell Wilson taking to the air only 26 times. Even with an expanded role in the absence of George Pickens (groin), that led to a modest stat line for Williams. Nevertheless, it was his best usage as a Steeler, and he finished tied for second on the team in targets. Even with some slight reason for optimism, it’s difficult to trust that Williams will post a meaningful stat line heading into a Week 15 matchup against the Eagles.</p> <h4 id="jauan-jennings-wr">Jauan Jennings (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br> <strong>Details:</strong> George Kittle led the 49ers in receiving yards (151) Sunday while Jennings took top honors in catches, targets and receiving touchdowns. The 27-year-old wideout continues to excel in a starting role for a San Francisco team that has lost several key players over the course of the season. Jennings is having a breakout season with a career-best line of 57-774-6 through 11 contests. He will attempt to build on those numbers in a potential high-scoring affair against the Rams on Thursday Night Football in Week 15.</p> <h4 id="jaxon-smith-njigba-wr">Jaxon Smith-Njigba (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Smith-Njigba finished as the Seahawks’ leading receiver despite finishing third in targets Sunday. The budding sophomore cashed in Seattle’s lone passing touchdown while setting a new high in season scores (five). Smith-Njigba has been white-hot in the second half of the schedule, averaging yards 101.5 yards from scrimmage with four total touchdowns over his last six contests. Fantasy managers should feel confident starting JSN as the Seahawks prepare to face the Packers next Sunday.</p> <h4 id="baker-mayfield-qb">Baker Mayfield (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Mayfield ultimately finished with an impressive yardage and touchdown total, but his road to those numbers was rocky at times. The veteran signal-caller took four sacks from an aggressive Raiders defense and tossed a pair of first-half interceptions following a fast start. Prior to the miscues, Mayfield had capped off the Buccaneers’ first two drives with touchdown passes to Jalen McMillan (15 yards) and Rachaad White (five yards). He also came on late after Tampa Bay’s first two second-half drives ended in punts, capping off a five-play game-sealing drive with a 29-yard scoring strike to McMillan. Mayfield does have four interceptions over his last two games, but he’s also tossed four touchdowns in that span going into a Week 15 road matchup against the Chargers.</p> <h4 id="austin-ekeler-rb">Austin Ekeler (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Injured Reserve <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Ekeler said he doesn’t remember walking off the field Nov. 24 against the Cowboys, or indeed anything until he got in the ambulance to go to the hospital. The veteran running back also states he had memory loss following his Week 3 concussion earlier in the season. All of these symptoms led to Ekeler’s placement on injured reserve ahead of Week 13, sidelining him until at least Week 18. Brian Robinson, Jeremy McNichols and Chris Rodriguez are set to handle backfield duties while Ekeler is out.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-height="630" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_14_2024_TOM_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br><br></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-height="630" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_14_2024_TOM_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> </div> </article> <br> <hr> <br> <ul class="list-disc pl-8"></ul> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-0/">Year 2 League Changes</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-18_preview/">Week 18 Matchups Preview</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-17_Recap/">Week 17 League Recap</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/reports/2025/Week-17-WKCR/">Who Killed Charbonnet Ramsey?
