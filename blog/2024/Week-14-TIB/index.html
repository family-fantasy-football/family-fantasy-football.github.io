Lost against Hit and Ruggs 103.98-131.44<br> Current Standing: #5<br> Playoff Chances: 0.0%<br> Lineup Efficiency: 86.7%<br> Best Performer: Bijan Robinson (19.10 pts)<br></p> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="darnell-mooney-wr">Darnell Mooney (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Mooney led the Falcons in receiving yards on the afternoon with a figure that also qualified as a career high. The speedster was a menace to the Vikings’ defense throughout the contest, recording catches of 28, 24 and 49 yards in the first half alone. Mooney also had 18- and 14-yard grabs in the second half, and his prolific performance was a sorely needed one after the veteran wideout had posted just a 5-47 line over the previous two games. Mooney heads into a Week 15 road battle against the Raiders on Monday night, Dec. 16 just 117 receiving yards shy of his second career 1,000-yard campaign.</p> <h4 id="bijan-robinson-rb">Bijan Robinson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Facing a Vikings defense that had been one of the best in the league at stopping the run, Robinson put together a workman-like effort that saw him grind out 4.2 yards per tote with the second-highest carry total of his career. Robinson also recorded a rushing touchdown for the second consecutive game – and fourth time in the last four contests – on a 13-yard run late in the third quarter, and he’s now eclipsed 90 rushing yards in three of his last four games as well. Robinson’s workload pushed him over the 20-carry mark in consecutive games for the first time in his young career, affording him plenty of momentum as the fantasy playoffs begin and he heads into a favorable Week 15 road matchup against the Raiders on Monday night, Dec. 16.</p> <h4 id="dalton-kincaid-te">Dalton Kincaid (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Out <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Kincaid, who last played in Week 10, was deemed questionable for the contest after practicing in limited fashion Wednesday through Friday. With the 2023 first-rounder sidelined once again Sunday, Dawson Knox is on track to continue see added opportunities as the Bills’ top pass-catching tight end option, while Zach Davidson is on hand to provide depth at the position in Week 14.</p> <h4 id="cole-kmet-te">Cole Kmet (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Four days removed from earning 10 targets during a defeat to the Vikings, Kmet fell back to what he more or less has received most weeks this season (26 targets in the nine games in which he didn’t see double-digit looks). Elsewhere in the Bears’ skill ranks Thursday, DJ Moore led the way by a large margin with an 8-97-1 line on 16 targets, Keenan Allen scored twice among his five catches for 73 yards on eight targets, and Rome Odunze (2-25-0 on six targets) and D’Andre Swift (2-35-0 on three targets) also got in the act. With that knowledge, Kmet likely will resume his modest role in Chicago’s offense in his next game Sunday, Dec. 8 in San Francisco.</p> <h4 id="mike-gesicki-te">Mike Gesicki (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Gesicki’s production had been tied to Tee Higgins’ availability, though both managed to get involved Sunday. Gesicki finished third on the team in targets and tallied long receptions of 20 and 18 yards. Nevertheless, it will be difficult to trust him moving forward as he has managed to top 30 receiving yards in only three of seven games with Higgins on the field.</p> <h4 id="tee-higgins-wr">Tee Higgins (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Higgins continues to command targets at an elite rate, with Sunday’s effort marking the fourth time in seven games that he’s seen double-digit opportunities. It wasn’t his most efficient effort, but he had a 31-yard reception midway through the third quarter and hauled in a one-yard touchdown reception one quarter later to turn in a strong fantasy performance. Higgins now has five touchdowns on the campaign and has a trip to the end zone in three straight contests.</p> <h4 id="troy-franklin-wr">Troy Franklin (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Franklin has now recorded just two receptions in three straight games, while playing around 42 percent of the Broncos’ offensive snaps per game in that span. The rookie wideout has played in a secondary role in Denver’s offense as he continues to develop in head coach Sean Payton’s system. Franklin’s chemistry with quarterback Bo Nix from their time at Oregon has helped him to garner steady targets throughout the season, but he isn’t seeing enough volume to be trusted for fantasy purposes. The 21-year-old heads into the Broncos’ Week 14 bye with a total of 21 catches for 218 yards and two touchdowns through 12 games. The Broncos will return from the bye to host the Colts on Dec. 15.</p> <h4 id="amon-ra-st-brown-wr">Amon-Ra St. Brown (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br> <strong>Details:</strong> As had been the case in four of his previous five meetings with the Packers, St. Brown was held to under 57 receiving yards while furnishing his fourth-lowest yardage total of the campaign. However, he saved his most valuable contribution for his final catch, as he brought in a 16-yard dart from Jared Goff over the middle on second-and-17 with 1:42 remaining. Despite the modest numbers Thursday, St. Brown should be heavily involved in a Week 15 home matchup against the Bills on Sunday, Dec. 15 that could serve as a Super Bowl preview.</p> <h4 id="michael-pittman-jr-wr">Michael Pittman Jr. (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Second-year QB Anthony Richardson completed only half of his 24 attempts, and Pittman was by far the Colts’ leader in catches and receiving yards as a result despite his modest numbers. Since missing a Week 10 contest with back trouble, Pittman has been his usual stalwart self, posting a 16-184-0 line on 22 targets over three contests, but his TD drought now sits at six games. He’ll look to find paydirt again on the other side of the Colts’ Week 14 bye,</p> <h4 id="trevor-lawrence-qb">Trevor Lawrence (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Injured Reserve <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Regardless of the exact timing of surgery, Lawrence won’t play again this season and should have plenty of time to recover before Week 1 of 2025. It’s his left, non-throwing shoulder that will be operated on, which means there shouldn’t be much impact for next season even if the process is delayed a few weeks. Jacksonville’s roster and/or coaching staff may look very different by the time Lawrence is healthy.</p> <h4 id="quentin-johnston-wr">Quentin Johnston (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Some assumed Johnston would operate as the team’s top target with Ladd McConkey (shoulder/knee) sidelined, but Joshua Palmer took over as the intermediate focal point (6-9-78). Johnston still nearly saw a season high in looks (he had eight back in Week 11), which is a prominent point especially because the second-year target was still used as a deep-threat specialist. Given the litany of difficult injuries McConkey seems to be trying to gut through, Johnston and Palmer could once again see an uptick in work against a bad Tampa Bay defense next week.</p> <h4 id="raheem-mostert-rb">Raheem Mostert (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Out <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> out</p> <h4 id="devin-singletary-rb">Devin Singletary (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Singletary opened the campaign as New York’s starting running back, but he’s since given way to rookie Tyrone Tracy in the backfield. Tracy carried 16 times Sunday and was targeted 10 times, while Singletary was barely heard from with his two rushes, which went for four yards apiece. Given his increasingly limited opportunities, Singletary would likely need Tracy to miss time in order to be a viable fantasy asset again, even in deeper leagues.</p> <h4 id="aaron-rodgers-qb">Aaron Rodgers (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Rodgers not only surpassed 200 passing yards for the first time since Week 9, but he exceeded 300 for the first time as a member of the Jets. He found Garrett Wilson for a 35-yard gain to convert on fourth down in the second quarter, setting up Isaiah Davis’ 17-yard touchdown run on the next play. Rodgers connected with Wilson again for a 42-yard pickup in the third quarter to set up Rodgers’ only touchdown pass of the afternoon – a three-yarder to Davante Adams. All told, Wilson and Adams combined for 223 of Rodgers’ 339 passing yards, but the Jets never got a chance to possess the ball in overtime as Miami drove down the field to drop New York’s record to 3-10. Barring an announcement to the contrary from the team, Rodgers will remain the starter in Week 15, when the Jets face the 3-10 Jaguars in a game with significant implications for the 2025 NFL Draft order.</p> <h4 id="russell-wilson-qb">Russell Wilson (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Wilson started the game slowly as he had just 46 yards on 16 attempts at halftime. However, he led the Steelers on an eight-play, 67-yard touchdown drive that ended with a 10-yard pass to Van Jefferson on the team’s first offensive possession. One drive later, he took advantage of a short field and delivered a 20-yard score to Pat Freiermuth. This wasn’t Wilson’s most prolific performance, but he managed the offense well and threw for multiple scores for the fourth time in seven starts on the campaign.</p> <h4 id="tyler-lockett-wr">Tyler Lockett (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Lockett couldn’t haul in an end-zone target, as Cardinals’ rookie CB Max Melton blanketed the veteran receiver. Since Week 7, Lockett has produced more than 20 receiving yards just once while Jaxon Smith-Njigba and DK Metcalf received a bulk of the targets. It will be difficult to trust Lockett in fantasy moving forward.</p> <h4 id="kenneth-walker-iii-rb">Kenneth Walker III (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Out <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Macdonald added that Walker no longer is dealing with the ankle issue that, along with the calf concern, capped him to one limited session last week and kept him out of Sunday’s win at Arizona. The Seahawks will post their first practice report of Week 15 prep Wednesday, at which point his activity level may be telling for his chances to return to action this coming Sunday against the Packers. In Walker’s absence Week 14, Zach Charbonnet handled an 80 percent snap share and racked up 29 touches for 193 yards from scrimmage and two rushing TDs, while Kenny McIntosh earned 23 percent of snaps en route to nine touches for 45 total yards.</p> <h4 id="mike-evans-wr">Mike Evans (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Evans tied Sterling Shepard and Jalen McMillan for the team lead in receptions while checking in second in receiving yards. The veteran wideout got a big chunk of his production on a 32-yard grab, which was the second longest of the game for the Buccaneers. Evans has eclipsed 60 receiving yards in three straight games heading into a Week 15 road battle against the Chargers.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-height="630" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_14_2024_TIB_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br><br></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-height="630" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_14_2024_TIB_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> </div> </article> <br> <hr> <br> <ul class="list-disc pl-8"></ul> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2024/Week-14_Recap/">Week 14 League Recap</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2024/Week-14-WKCR/">Who Killed Charbonnet Ramsey?
