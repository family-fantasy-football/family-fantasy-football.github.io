<article class="post-content"> <div id="markdown-content"> <h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Hamlin My Business Won against To Infinity and Bijan! 138.08-125.76<br> Current Standing: #2<br> Playoff Chances: 100.0%<br> Lineup Efficiency: 87.7%<br> Best Performer: Najee Harris (21.90 pts)<br></p> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="dandre-swift-rb">D’Andre Swift (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Swift dealt with a quadriceps injury during the practice week before ultimately being cleared for action Sunday. The 25-year-old dominated the backfield touches, but his 15 combined touches resulted in just 40 total yards. Swift has averaged well under four yards per carry in five of his last six contests with only one trip to the end zone over that span. Things won’t get any easier for the Bears’ offense as they prepare for a road tilt against Minnesota next Monday.</p> <h4 id="joe-burrow-qb">Joe Burrow (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Burrow led another comeback effort that fell short, this time throwing a pair of touchdowns from one and three yards away in the game’s final eight minutes. He also completed four passes of at least 20 yards, all of which came in the game’s final two quarters. While the effort marked his third straight game with more than 300 yards and fourth straight contest with at least three passing scores, Burrow did make a few critical errors by throwing a pick and losing a pair of fumbles – the worst of which was a lost fumble that was returned for a touchdown early in the fourth quarter.</p> <h4 id="devaughn-vele-wr">Devaughn Vele (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Vele’s Week 13 performance was a major disappointment considering rookie quarterback Bo Nix threw for 294 yards against the Browns. Operating as the No. 2 wideout, Vele played 31 of the Broncos’ 66 offensive snaps Monday, second only to Courtland Sutton’s 62. The rookie will look to bounce back against the Colts on Dec. 15 when the Broncos return from their Week 14 bye.</p> <h4 id="jameson-williams-wr">Jameson Williams (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Williams led the team in receiving yards on a team-high eight targets, most notably reeling in a 28-yard catch in the first quarter. The wide receiver’s dynamic skill set has led to some big performances this season, and the five catches matched his season high, which he now has accomplished in three straight games and five times overall in 2024. On the year, Williams has caught 39 of 63 targets for 710 yards and four touchdowns while appearing in 11 games.</p> <h4 id="ameer-abdullah-rb">Ameer Abdullah (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Details:</strong> The veteran back was busy all afternoon with both Zamir White (quadriceps) and Alexander Mattison (ankle) inactive, and he supplemented his work on offense with a productive effort on special teams. Abdullah’s 68-yard kickoff return late in the third quarter set the Raiders up on the Chiefs’ 26-yard line for a drive that culminated in a Brock Bowers touchdown grab two plays later. Abdullah finished with two fewer carries and 25 less rushing yards than backfield mate Sincere McCormick, but he offered serviceable fantasy production overall. However, Abdullah could be back to his customary third-down role in short order, considering both White and Mattison seemingly have a good chance of being available for a Week 14 road matchup against the Buccaneers on Sunday, Dec. 8.</p> <h4 id="ladd-mcconkey-wr">Ladd McConkey (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Out <br> <strong>Details:</strong> After being limited at practice Wednesday through Friday, McConkey was listed as questionable for the Chargers’ Sunday evening tilt. With McConkey having been made inactive, Quentin Johnston, Joshua Palmer, Jalen Reagor, Derius Davis and DJ Chark are in line to handle the team’s Week 14 wideout duties. McConkey’s next chance to see game action will arrive Dec. 15 versus the Buccaneers.</p> <h4 id="demarcus-robinson-wr">Demarcus Robinson (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Robinson finished with zero catches (one target) during Sunday’s high-scoring affair, though he had a number of notable plays, including what would have been a 56-yard catch, wiped away by penalties. He also briefly left the game due to a shoulder injury, but was able to retake the field. McVay said he hopes Robinson’s availability for Week 15 won’t be impacted, but the veteran wideout’s practice status will need to be monitored leading up to Thursday’s contest.</p> <h4 id="matthew-stafford-qb">Matthew Stafford (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Despite the score and the stat line of Josh Allen, the Rams prioritized their running game. That limited Stafford’s passing volume, but he made up for that by averaging 10.7 yards per attempt while completing four passes of more than 20 yards. He also found the end zone on passes of 17 and 19 yards to Puka Nacua and Cooper Kupp, respectively. Stafford now has multiple scores in four straight games with no interceptions, though this was his first 300-yard performance since Week 1.</p> <h4 id="tyreek-hill-wr">Tyreek Hill (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Hill and Jaylen Waddle posted identical first-half stat lines of five catches for 61 yards, and they ultimately accounted for 214 of Tua Tagovailoa’s 331 passing yards as the Dolphins capitalized on the absence of star Jets cornerback Sauce Gardner (hamstring). Hill’s four-yard touchdown catch followed by a two-point conversion to Waddle helped Miami tie the game 23-23 with 9:04 to play in regulation. Despite playing through a wrist injury in recent weeks, Hill has been heating up. The speedster has scored in four of the past five games, and Hill has topped 80 receiving yards in each of his last two outings ahead of a Week 15 road game against the Texans after reaching that mark only twice through Week 12.</p> <h4 id="aaron-jones-rb">Aaron Jones (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Details:</strong> A week after having issues with ball security, Jones turned in a clean performance that also featured his third performance of better than 70 rushing yards in the last five contests. Jones also recorded his second rushing touchdown in the last three games on a 15-yard run with 3:38 remaining to cap off the runaway win. The veteran back heads into a Week 15 home matchup against the Bears on Monday night, Dec. 16 now just 117 rushing yards away from the fourth 1,000-yard campaign of his career.</p> <h4 id="hunter-henry-te">Hunter Henry (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Details:</strong> The veteran tight end once again led the Patriots in catches, targets and receiving yards, but Henry got denied a bigger performance when Austin Hooper caught Drake Maye’s only TD of the day in the second quarter instead. Henry is on the verge of a career-best campaign, needing just three more catches and 43 more yards to set new personal bests in those categories. He’ll aim for those marks on the other side of New England’s Week 14 bye.</p> <h4 id="marquez-valdes-scantling-wr">Marquez Valdes-Scantling (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Details:</strong> The veteran wideout led the Saints in receiving yards, just nudging out Juwan Johnson’s 50, but it was the tight end who caught Derek Carr’s only TD. The QB left the game late in the fourth quarter to be checked out for a concussion and a hand injury, and while Valdes-Scantling has an 11-283-4 line on 17 targets over the last four games, he’ll likely have trouble finding the same success in Week 15 against the Commanders if Jake Haener or Spencer Rattler is under center for the Saints instead of Carr.</p> <h4 id="malik-nabers-wr">Malik Nabers (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Details:</strong> While it wasn’t an efficient performance, Nabers led the Giants in receiving yards and tied for the team lead in catches with Tyrone Tracy and Daniel Bellinger. Nabers hasn’t gotten into the end zone since Week 3, but the rookie wideout has caught at least five passes in six straight games despite the team’s QB turmoil, posting a 41-392-0 line on 66 targets. Nabers will try to take advantage of an exploitable secondary in Week 15 against the Ravens.</p> <h4 id="najee-harris-rb">Najee Harris (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Details:</strong> The Steelers had a mediocre day offensively, with nearly all of their skill-position players posting modest stat lines. Harris was no exception, as he managed only 3.3 yards per carry despite tallying a 20-yard gain for the second consecutive game. Even with the inefficiency, Harris still managed a decent fantasy performance thanks to a one-yard touchdown run early in the second quarter. Since Russell Wilson has taken over under center, Harris has four trips to the end zone in seven contests, though he’s failed to reach 80 yards on the ground in five straight matchups.</p> <h4 id="george-kittle-te">George Kittle (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Kittle played like a man possessed against the Bears after recording just one reception for seven yards the week prior. Weather played a huge role in the road stinker against Buffalo, so Sunday’s sunny conditions allowed the star tight end to feast on Chicago’s defense. Kittle upped his season line to 56-800-8 in the much-needed win, confirming the tight end’s upper-echelon status in fantasy ahead of Thursday’s primetime tilt against the Rams.</p> <h4 id="brock-purdy-qb">Brock Purdy (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Purdy did suffer an injury scare in the fourth quarter on a roughing the passer penalty that saw the quarterback’s body bend backward in an awkward fashion between two Chicago defenders. The star QB was writhing in pain on the ground following the hit, but he wound up missing just one play before returning to the field, as reported by 49ers’ reporter Cam Inman. Aside from the brief injury scare, Purdy was firing on all cylinders against the scuttling Bears, which comes as a relief to fantasy managers following last week’s dud against the Bills in the snow. Assuming that there are no lingering effects from getting clotheslined Sunday, Purdy could be in store for another high score in a potential shootout against the Rams on Thursday Night Football in Week 15.</p> <h4 id="nick-westbrook-ikhine-wr">Nick Westbrook-Ikhine (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Westbrook-Ikhine has been reliant upon big plays all season, though he had been carving out a bigger role in the Tennessee offense by commanding at least five targets in three straight games. He took a step back in Sunday’s loss, drawing his lowest target count since Week 6. Westbrook-Ikhine should have the chance to rebound in Week 15 against the Bengals, though the state of the Titans’ offense will leave him as a boom-or-bust option down the stretch.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-height="630" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_13_2024_HMB_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br><br></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-height="630" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_13_2024_HMB_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> </div> </article> <br> <hr> <br> <ul class="list-disc pl-8"></ul> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2024/Week-13_Recap/">Week 13 League Recap</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2024/Week-13-WKCR/">Who Killed Charbonnet Ramsey?
