<article class="post-content"> <div id="markdown-content"> <h2 id="week-at-a-glance">Week at a Glance</h2> <p>Hit and Ruggs Won against To Infinity and Bijan! 131.44-103.98<br> Current Standing: #6<br> Playoff Chances: 0.0%<br> Lineup Efficiency: 86.7%<br> Best Performer: Justin Jefferson (28.70 pts)<br></p> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="marvin-harrison-jr-wr">Marvin Harrison Jr. (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Harrison has reached 50 receiving yards only five times in his up-and-down rookie season. His eight targets against Seattle ranked second behind Trey McBride’s 14, and Harrison’s 20 targets over the last two games are the most he has seen in a two-game span. While there’s reason for long-term optimism with the fourth overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, including Harrison’s team-leading total of seven receiving touchdowns, he can’t be viewed as a surefire fantasy starter in most formats when the Cardinals host the Patriots in Week 15.</p> <h4 id="trey-mcbride-te">Trey McBride (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> After producing 12 catches in each of his previous two games, including in Week 12 against Seattle, McBride was blanked on three first-half targets. He returned to his productive ways in the second half to finish with the team lead in targets, catches and receiving yards. McBride has secured his second consecutive 80-catch season with 80 receptions for 851 yards heading into a Week 15 home game against the Patriots.</p> <h4 id="diontae-johnson-wr">Diontae Johnson (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Suspension <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> General manager Eric DeCosta said in a statement that the decision to suspend Johnson stemmed from the receiver’s refusal to enter the game in last Sunday’s 24-19 loss to the Eagles. Since being acquired from the Panthers in late October, Johnson has played a total of 39 offensive snaps and has just one catch for six yards across five contests with Baltimore. Tylan Wallace has even leapfrogged Johnson on the depth chart as the team’s No. 4 receiver, and the suspension likely won’t help Johnson’s chances of regaining playing time when he’s eligible to return to action Week 16 versus Pittsburgh.</p> <h4 id="ray-davis-rb">Ray Davis (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Davis was involved early, scoring a five-yard rushing touchdown in the first quarter, but most of his yardage came later in the game after the result was no longer in doubt. James Cook (14 carries for 107 yards and a touchdown) paced Buffalo’s backfield as usual, but Davis benefited from a run-heavy game plan in snowy conditions. Davis will continue to work as the team’s No. 2 running back behind Cook in Week 14 against the Rams.</p> <h4 id="rome-odunze-wr">Rome Odunze (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Odunze cashed in a pair of garbage-time touchdowns in Sunday’s blowout loss for the first multi-score game of his young career. When the rookie scored during the contest shouldn’t matter to fantasy managers, who had witnessed just one trip to the end zone over the wideout’s previous 12 contests. Odunze’s inconsistency in Chicago’s flailing offense keeps him from relevance in shallower formats ahead of next Monday’s tilt against Minnesota.</p> <h4 id="chase-brown-rb">Chase Brown (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Brown scored his ninth touchdown of the season off a lengthy reception Monday, but the play needed a successful challenge to overrule the referees marking the back out at the three-yard line. The 24-year-old got a highlight moment by leaping into the Salvation Army holiday pot at AT&amp;T Stadium, paying homage to Ezekiel Elliott’s touchdown celebration back in 2016. Brown has scored all nine of his touchdowns over the Bengals’ last 10 games, making him a strong fantasy asset heading in to a soft matchup against the Titans on Sunday.</p> <h4 id="jared-goff-qb">Jared Goff (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Goff got the Lions off and running with a crisp 11-play, 70-yard march that culminated in a David Montgomery three-yard walk-in rushing touchdown on the first possession of the contest. The veteran signal-caller would go on to struggle some during the rest of the first half, although he did get Detroit back in the end zone before halftime with a two-yard scoring toss to Jahmyr Gibbs. Goff would throw his one interception on a slant during Detroit’s first drive of the second half, a pick that led to a Packers touchdown. Nevertheless, he would redeem himself with three- and one-yard scoring tosses to Tim Patrick, while recording a pair of clutch completions during the game-winning drive late in the fourth quarter. Goff’s interception broke a three-game streak without a pick, but he still boasts a 9:1 TD:INT over his last four contests heading into a Week 15 home showdown against Josh Allen and the Bills on Sunday, Dec. 15.</p> <h4 id="cooper-kupp-wr">Cooper Kupp (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Kupp was overshadowed by Puka Nacua’s 162-yard performance, but he had a solid showing of his own while operating as the Rams’ big-play threat. He had long receptions of 37 and 24 yards and also found the end zone on a 17-yard reception late in the third quarter. After combining to record only 77 yards across his last two games, this was a needed bounceback performance for Kupp, though he is still clearly operating behind Nacua as the second option in the passing game.</p> <h4 id="jaylen-waddle-wr">Jaylen Waddle (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Waddle caught the game-tying two-point conversion with 9:04 left in the fourth quarter, and Miami tied the game again with a field goal in the final seconds before winning it in overtime. The Dolphins’ passing game has heated up heading into a Week 15 trip to Houston. Tua Tagovailoa has topped 300 passing yards in each of his last three starts, with Waddle accounting for 296 receiving yards and a touchdown over that span.</p> <h4 id="devon-achane-rb">De’Von Achane (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Achane finally opened the scoring with a two-yard touchdown run after mustering just one yard on three previous rushing attempts inside the 3-yard line. He later went to the medical tent to be evaluated for a concussion after taking a big hit, per CBS sideline reporter Melanie Collins, and Achane spent a significant chunk of the first half on the sideline before checking back in on Miami’s final drive before halftime. He failed to find much running room but remained heavily involved as a pass catcher, as has been customary when quarterback Tua Tagovailoa plays. Heading into a Week 15 trip to Houston, Achane has racked up at least six receptions in six of Tagovailoa’s nine starts this season.</p> <h4 id="justin-jefferson-wr">Justin Jefferson (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Jefferson finished just a reception and receiving yard shy of tying Jordan Addison for the team lead in both categories, but he enjoyed a highly efficient afternoon during which he finished with his third-highest receiving yardage total of the campaign. Jefferson also crossed the goal line for the first time since Week 7 with 12- and 52-yard touchdown grabs in the second and third quarters, respectively. The standout receiver has at least 81 receiving yards in three of the last four games heading into a Week 15 home divisional clash against the Bears on Monday night, Dec. 16.</p> <h4 id="sam-darnold-qb">Sam Darnold (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Darnold and the Vikings punted after seven plays on their first drive, but the offensive showcase began on Minnesota’s second possession in the form of a 49-yard touchdown pass to Jordan Addison. Darnold encountered little resistance the rest of the way while accumulating single-game career highs in passing yards and touchdowns, hitting Justin Jefferson (12 yards, 52 yards) and Addison (11 yards, six yards) for his other four scoring tosses. Darnold now has multiple touchdown-pass tallies without an interception in four straight games, as well as a pair of 300-yard efforts in the last three contests. The veteran quarterback’s resurgent season’s next chapter unfolds at home against the Bears in a Week 15 Monday night matchup Dec. 16.</p> <h4 id="antonio-gibson-rb">Antonio Gibson (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> The fifth-year RB posted his best rushing yards total since Week 2, and Gibson capped his big performance with an 11-yard TD run in the fourth quarter that gave the Patriots a 24-17 lead. The trip to the end zone was the first of the season for the former Washington back – his last touchdown came in Week 16 of 2023. He hasn’t seen double-double digits touches while Rhamondre Stevenson has been healthy since Week 2, but Gibson’s ability to turn small holes into big gains could lead to a bigger role in the offense on the other side of New England’s Week 14 bye.</p> <h4 id="wandale-robinson-wr">Wan’Dale Robinson (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> The slot receiver led the Giants in targets but did little with the volume, finishing third on the team in receiving yards and fourth in catches. Robinson has caught multiple passes in every game this season, but he hasn’t scored a touchdown since Week 5 and hasn’t topped 60 yards since Week 4. He’ll try to do more with his opportunities in Week 15 against the Ravens.</p> <h4 id="breece-hall-rb">Breece Hall (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Out <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> out</p> <h4 id="allen-lazard-wr">Allen Lazard (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> IR <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Seeing his first action since Week 7, Lazard played 78 percent of snaps on offense, so his lack of production wasn’t due to a lack of playing time. He’s a distant third on the Jets’ wide receiver depth chart behind Garrett Wilson and Davante Adams, who combined for 223 yards and a touchdown on 21 targets against the Dolphins. Lazard will be a touchdown-dependent Week 15 fantasy option against a Jaguars defense that’s giving up 26.5 points per game.</p> <h4 id="braelon-allen-rb">Braelon Allen (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Allen split time evenly with Isaiah Davis in the absence of lead back Breece Hall (knee), as both rookie running backs had 16 combined carries and targets. The biggest play between the two was a 17-yard touchdown run by Davis in the second quarter, while Allen has still scored only once since his two-touchdown performance back in Week 2. If Hall remains unavailable in Week 15, both Allen and Davis would have substantial fantasy value against the vulnerable Jacksonville defense.</p> <h4 id="dallas-goedert-te">Dallas Goedert (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Injured Reserve <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> This was reported earlier by various sources, but it was officially confirmed by the team later in the day. Grant Calcaterra and C.J. Uzomah will be tasked with taking on the work vacated by Goedert, who will be eligible to return during the team’s final week of the regular season.</p> <h4 id="geno-smith-qb">Geno Smith (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Smith kept the chains moving against a division rival with efficient play from the pocket while going 7-for-15 on third-down attempts, helping his team hold onto sole possession of first place in the NFC West following the victory. The veteran signal-caller let Seattle’s rushing attack do the heavy lifting against Arizona on the back of Zach Charbonnet’s standout effort (22-134-2). Smith hasn’t been asked to do much over the Seahawks’ current win streak, but he could be in store for more work against a high-powered Packers offense next Sunday.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-height="630" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_14_2024_RRT_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br><br></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-height="630" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_14_2024_RRT_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> </div> </article> <br> <hr> <br> <ul class="list-disc pl-8"></ul> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2024/Week-14_Recap/">Week 14 League Recap</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2024/Week-14-WKCR/">Who Killed Charbonnet Ramsey?
