</code></pre> <h2 id="player-report">Player Report</h2> <h4 id="kyler-murray-qb">Kyler Murray (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> QB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Murray left the contest briefly to be examined for a potential head injury after a late hit in the second half of Sunday’s lopsided win. Backup Clayton Tune replaced Arizona’s starter for the remainder of the drive before Murray retook the reins on the ensuing drive. While the dual-threat QB didn’t throw any touchdowns for fantasy mangers Sunday, his only potential interception was erased by a roughing the passer penalty on the play during which he was injured. Murray escaped the win in good health, putting the signal-caller on track to start next Sunday’s tilt against Carolina.</p> <h4 id="kirk-cousins-qb">Kirk Cousins (QB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> OP <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Cousins’ numbers were hardly of the redemptive variety after a four-game stretch that may have had his starting job in danger, but the veteran signal-caller at least snapped his four-game touchdown drought with a 30-yard first-quarter scoring strike to Drake London. Cousins ultimately wasn’t tasked with doing much more against an inept Raiders offense helmed by Desmond Ridder, leading to his lowest passing yardage total of the campaign. Cousins may enjoy a similar game script in a Week 16 home matchup against the lowly Giants, who also should pose very little threat.</p> <h4 id="zay-flowers-wr">Zay Flowers (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Flowers finished with team-high catch and target totals in the lopsided win, but he was only third in receiving yards behind Rashod Bateman and Justice Hill. The second-year wideout has eclipsed 50 receiving yards in three straight games for the first time this season heading into a Week 16 home matchup against the Steelers on Saturday afternoon.</p> <h4 id="curtis-samuel-wr">Curtis Samuel (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Questionable <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Prior to that, Samuel caught his only target for one yard. In his absence, Amari Cooper, Khalil Shakir, Keon Coleman and Mack Hollins are available to handle Buffalo’s wideout duties versus Detroit.</p> <h4 id="nick-chubb-rb">Nick Chubb (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Out <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Stefanski indicated that Chubb is done for the year but that he’s facing a “shorter-term recovery time” than he did last offseason, while rehabbing from a severe knee injury, Camryn Justice of News 5 Cleveland reports. Nonetheless, this marks the second year in a row in which Chubb has had his season end early due to injury, and he’ll begin his offseason focused on rehabbing. The soon-to-be 29-year-old is slated to become an unrestricted free agent at the start of the new league year in March, making his future with Cleveland uncertain. For the remainder of the 2024 campaign, beginning Sunday at Cincinnati, Jerome Ford looks positioned to operate as the No. 1 running back for the Browns, with D’Onta Foreman and Pierre Strong also available as depth options.</p> <h4 id="david-montgomery-rb">David Montgomery (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Out <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Montgomery appeared to sustain the injury on a three-yard run midway through the second quarter of Sunday’s 48-42 loss to the Bills. The Lions never ruled him out for the game, but he played limited snaps thereafter, finishing the game with season-low 35 total yards on nine touches (five carries, four receptions). The loss of Montgomery for the rest of the regular season and playoffs likely sets up Jahmyr Gibbs to take on a workhorse role out of the backfield. Behind Gibbs on the depth chart are special-teams ace Craig Reynolds and rookie Sione Vaki, both of whom could carve out larger secondary roles out of the backfield after logging just 12 and seven touches, respectively, though Detroit’s first 14 games. Montgomery wraps up his second season in Detroit with 185 carries for 775 yards (4.2 YPC) and 12 touchdowns to go with 36 catches for 341 yards on 38 targets. He’ll likely be placed on injured reserve in the coming days.</p> <h4 id="christian-watson-wr">Christian Watson (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Watson used his downfield playmaking ability to generate multiple chunk gains for the Packers, securing a 36-yard reception in the second quarter and drawing a 39-yard pass interference penalty in the third. He led Green Bay in receiving yards and tied Jayden Reed for the team lead in targets, though Romeo Doubs stole the show with two touchdown catches in the latter’s return from a concussion. Watson usually sees a few deep passes thrown his way per game and will look to make the most of those opportunities in Week 16 against the Saints.</p> <h4 id="adonai-mitchell-wr">Adonai Mitchell (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> It was a disappointing performance from the rookie, who moved into a larger role with Josh Downs out due to a shoulder injury. Mitchell started opposite Michael Pittman in a two-receiver set to begin the game and played 35 of the offense’s 62 snaps while running 16 routes. Mitchell could get a chance to bounce back after Indy’s bye in Week 14, as it’s not immediately clear if Downs will be ready to return.</p> <h4 id="travis-etienne-jr-rb">Travis Etienne Jr. (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Etienne reclaimed the lead role from Tank Bigsby, finishing with an 18-11 edge in touches after being out-touched, 19-8, by Bigsby against the Titans in Week 14. The week-to-week fluctuations limit both running backs’ upside heading into an otherwise favorable Week 16 matchup against the Raiders. Etienne’s 85 scrimmage yards against the Jets tied the season high he set back in Week 3 against the Bills.</p> <h4 id="xavier-worthy-wr">Xavier Worthy (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> The Chiefs made a concerted effort to get the ball into Worthy’s hands throughout the afternoon, with the rookie finishing with team-high totals in receptions, receiving yards and targets while also checking in third in rushing yards. Worthy also posted his third rushing touchdown of his career on a 21-yard run early in the second half, and his catch total was a new career high. Worthy has flashed a solid floor of late, as he’ll head into a Week 16 home matchup against the Texans on Saturday afternoon with at least four receptions and 46 receiving yards in five consecutive contests.</p> <h4 id="travis-kelce-te">Travis Kelce (TE)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> The star tight end had a quiet afternoon by his standards, but it came on an afternoon when Patrick Mahomes averaged just 4.2 yards per attempt overall. Kelce finished third on the team in receptions and receiving yards while also checking in second in targets, and he’ll head into a Week 16 home matchup against the Texans on Saturday afternoon with at least Sunday’s catch total in four consecutive contests.</p> <h4 id="alexander-mattison-rb">Alexander Mattison (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Mattison returned from an ankle injury of his own Monday before being thrust into a prominent role once Las Vegas’ starting running back was ruled out at halftime. The veteran tailback played poorly on his nine touches, losing a fumble and getting tackled for a safety. Fellow backup Ameer Abdullah produced 66 yards and a score on 10 combined touches (primarily as a receiving option) for comparison. If McCormick is forced to miss time, Mattison figures to be the next man up given his experience and success as a starter in the past, with Abdullah likely being mixed in sporadically against the Jaguars on Sunday.</p> <h4 id="gus-edwards-rb">Gus Edwards (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB/WR/TE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Edwards couldn’t get anything going on the ground, resulting in a mediocre 2.9 yards per carry. The power back isn’t tailored for an offense trying to come back from a large deficit like the Chargers were Sunday. The 29-year-old has struggled in three starts since taking over for J.K. Dobbins (knee), averaging a meager 30.3 yards per game over that span. Edwards needs to show some life against the Broncos on Thursday or he may begin losing snaps to rookie Kimani Vidal.</p> <h4 id="jalin-hyatt-wr">Jalin Hyatt (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Hyatt’s 20 offensive snaps were fourth most among Giants wideouts, well behind Malik Nabers (64), Wan’Dale Robinson (52) and Darius Slayton (46). Hyatt wasn’t able to draw a target while he was on the field, marking the third time over his past five games that he hasn’t had a ball thrown his way. Given his paltry production this season and low standing on the depth chart, as well as the overall struggles of New York’s passing game, Hyatt is off the fantasy radar in virtually all formats.</p> <h4 id="garrett-wilson-wr">Garrett Wilson (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> WR <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Wilson had a 19-yard catch followed by a 22-yard touchdown reception on consecutive plays on the Jets’ first drive. His next catch didn’t come until less than 10 minutes remained in the fourth quarter, but Wilson set up a third-quarter field goal in between by drawing a 30-yard pass-interference penalty. Wilson took a back seat to Davante Adams, who had nine catches for 198 yards and two touchdowns, all in the second half. With Aaron Rodgers enjoying a resurgence down the stretch, at least statistically, Wilson and Adams have coexisted effectively, so both wide receivers will be high-end fantasy options in Week 16 against the Rams.</p> <h4 id="devonta-smith-wr">DeVonta Smith (WR)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> BE <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Smith led the Eagles’ strong showing through the air, pacing the team in targets and receptions. He tallied long gains of 22 and 20 yards to surpass 100 yards for the first time on the campaign. Smith also hauled in a two-yard touchdown pass early in the second quarter, his second score in as many games since returning from a hamstring injury. His opportunities are often relatively limited – this marked the first time he’s topped seven targets since Week 3 – which has caused inconsistent production, though Smith showcased his fantasy potential with this performance.</p> <h4 id="tony-pollard-rb">Tony Pollard (RB)</h4> <p><strong>Injury Status:</strong> Active <br> <strong>Lineup Slot:</strong> RB <br> <strong>Details:</strong> Pollard got off to a strong start, as he accounted for 22 yards and a touchdown on the Titans’ opening possession. Things got rocky from there, however. In addition to briefly leaving the game due to ankle injury, Pollard also lost a fumble that should have been returned for a touchdown before Jordan Battle fumbled out of the end zone. Positively, Pollard remains the clear lead back and has shown the ability to excel on the ground despite the poor state of the Tennessee offense.</p> <h2 id="current-lineup">Current Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-height="630" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_15_2024_ARV_roster.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> <p><br><br></p> <h2 id="optimal-lineup">Optimal Lineup</h2> <table data-click-to-select="true" data-height="630" data-search="false" data-toggle="table" data-url="/assets/json/team_rosters/Week_15_2024_ARV_optimal.json"> <thead> <tr> <th data-field="player_name" data-halign="left" data-align="left" data-sortable="true">Player</th> <th data-field="pos" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Position</th> <th data-field="slot" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Slot</th> <th data-field="points" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Points</th> <th data-field="projected" data-halign="center" data-align="center" data-sortable="true">Projected</th> </tr> </thead> </table> </div> </article> <br> <hr> <br> <ul class="list-disc pl-8"></ul> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2024/Week-16_preview/">Week 16 Matchups Preview</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2024/Week-15_Recap/">Week 15 League Recap</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2024/Week-15-WKCR/">Who Killed Charbonnet Ramsey?
